<seg id="21"> Sorry, it is only that, from their perspective, NATO air raids followed a General from America, but Allah, the size of each povedeném celebrated intervention. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, when looking for winners in Libya, the West is among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We took part in the shootings, they served Islam and our politicians in the person of the dictator to get rid of a political ally, without guarantee a profit. </seg>

<seg id="110"> Children are also more frequently zaškrtly in the questionnaire, poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and the limit would be sweet food and dumplings. </seg>
<seg id="111"> He must be a good psychologist, says the pros </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the opening article about how to teach stylists, I&apos;m a bit postěžovala that the initial hours were a lot. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea, what will follow. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures of three professionals in the field, dress, troubled characters and a seminar about how it goes on set. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even if the course is being held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really &quot;tight&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we&apos;re discussing with the Director from Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only boy), how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly shapely figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And such is the vast majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone has a short neck, somebody&apos;s boy&apos;s figure without a sturdy set of curves, and someone&apos;s overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> He must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, to extend the neck or deliver the required curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got so tips for women-Jennifer Lopez, larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and wife neobléknout too. </seg>
<seg id="123"> For example, if the difference between the waist and hips, skirts or pants really doesn&apos;t fit, then it pays to have made at least one such piece. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly you won&apos;t regret it, because the perfectly good Plaid dress is priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In the skirt to the peace you feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, it&apos;s loose in the waist and the like. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Boys &apos; character, he can afford to wear clothes with řasením, applications, embroidery, or in making. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Such information, and the types of characters is of course much, so I&apos;m glad I&apos;ve got a whole week to get all the information in my head look. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And anyway, I&apos;m afraid that due to the specified domestic task is. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kurzistek, she is assigned a celebrity that has come up with two outfity: daily and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and the type of the character. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I&apos;ll be the &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerrovou, maybe you know her from Victoria&apos;s Secret campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the spirit of it, for me personally, definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (Bert, please recognize the retelling), or young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Outfits we have to abstain from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically processed. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, as the entire result says, then express our personal style and the relationship to the graphics rendering. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Think about the graphic page styling down is important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> He had to wear only physically, but also, for example, of the so-called product page in magazines (to a specific type, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> He told us about it, and the designer Mario Stonemason. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But until Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> He must have a general overview of the </seg>
<seg id="140"> Saturday Lecture a loaded information about the types of figures of the movement three guests from the scope. </seg>
<seg id="141"> He Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and he should be able to take advantage of. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And handsome he can work with one piece of clothing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variability in this case is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So a trenčkot (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) could wear classic across the jeans and t-shirt as a cloak, but you can get dressed and naked body, dressing up in high heels and photographed as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and now the whole look looks different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with it,&quot; he emphasized. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But mostly, I appreciate the following advice: &quot;to work you need to perfectly know the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then you can start to break,&quot; said James. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, it is clear to me, why are all these propositions, sliced with the combine, what, why, when, in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention about the shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that he must have prepared much more variants of clothes than they are taking pictures. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So fashion story, which will have ten parties (ten outfitů), I have to be ready to &quot;nastajlovat&quot; at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And that in the picture the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes quite differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With it we have to create the outfitu count. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style is sometimes up to half of success, we confirmed the Honza Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, which is not just a singer, but image and marketing from her world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic&apos;s approach to the use of the services of stylists, rather cold. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even familiar faces it can be construed as useless (it&apos;s something I can do, that&apos;s how I look at it, it is secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone from us leaves create the styling, then we expect that the US is likely to nadiktuje a completely different (smaller) size than it really is. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then do googlovat and see if the tabloids writing about the celebrity ztoustla/lost weight and so on. </seg>
<seg id="162"> John and Mario on Sunday, put us on the heart, that is not enough stylistovi in fashion and know how to piece together outfits. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Their work primarily communicates with human beings, which dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> To be able to assess people, nepodbízet, state your opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If you a Manager to protřídili her wardrobe and complete it on Nice pieces, so you can&apos;t wear the whole case and say, my God, this is terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Find there at least a few things pochválíte and recommend what they wear,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also specifically pointed to what it must contain a so-called &quot;placovka&quot;, or &quot;bag on the set. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It&apos;s the one that turns around the waist and have all the necessary paraphernalia. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, roller on the hair or pins, there are also silonová yarn (with her he helps out in the photo products such as handbags or hats), special just clips, which we clip the clothes in the back, if it is more (a PIN or other staple are not admissible, damaging the garment), or sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> We just didn&apos;t listen, but also virtually anything, but we have learned how to properly podlepit shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even in a photo shoot at the Studio, where the flat surface, the foot may harm, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we&apos;re stuck and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Scissors bot we can&apos;t even touch that happens to be damaging. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is therefore really need skill. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario me when my baby without reservations. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Mentioned skill are not my friend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is just a tiny fraction of what we talk about the second weekend the continuation rate hearing. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I&apos;m getting more and more clear that attending styling down on professional level really isn&apos;t a cakewalk, says who wants what it wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: The Run, the race across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Reviews </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally, the rider is a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy mistakes in a routine early morning trip to shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Ambitions are to a large extent to fill, but it&apos;s not valid, if no one apparently didn&apos;t want to do anything extra. </seg>
<seg id="183"> New episode: The Run attracted before the release of high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised that the venerable racing series Need for Speed, once again, moves a new direction and the playable demos appeared as a game, which, in the genre of racing might not be just the number. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Also, we were wondering how they inserted passages in which the main character gets out of the car and will take place on foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As for the NFS series is custom, many of them in the result a little differently than we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It&apos;s potentially decent arcaded races, but a whole runs down some unnecessary errors that appear in the series are more or less already for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it&apos;s actually not errors, but rather a sign of some sort of incomprehensible laziness of developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are introduced to the story, the main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature, and as a solution offers participation in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Behind the wheel recline on the West Coast in San Francisco and your task is to reach the first in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty plants. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It follows that every race on the other line and the stages are integrated into different, sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Man does not have a feeling that the game was always the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the environment are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponding to the previous parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So it&apos;s nothing to write home about. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the ride across the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The races are, in addition, from time to time some zpestřeny the unusual element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, přimotáte in the sand storm, which significantly reduces the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> By contrast, in the mountains again, you must be careful not to nezasypala you. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition, they are quite good for a planted rather individual races. </seg>
<seg id="203"> While it is only a few types, but it&apos;s enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> A moment so you&apos;re trying to pass the required number of opponents (basically the classic race), then our gaining on them time (a classic duel with peduncles), and then you must duel with a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It still gets from time to time and the police, which all your efforts even further znepříjemňuje. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Novelty are the passages out of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Rather, it is just such an interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone running and you must help him, in the correct order you are printing the correct buttons. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Surprised, however, that these passages is in the game much less than you&apos;d expect (more specifically, maybe even only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> As a result, but it is to the benefit of things, because this element has no chance to become a nuisance and in the context of the above said is one of the elements that the game by. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Driving model is following in the footsteps of the previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that it&apos;s certainly not a big deal, but you can&apos;t say that would be a big drawback. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you&apos;re looking for a realistic simulation, you&apos;ll have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But akčněji pojatému racing its bicycles model meets the still quite well, although we could find better competitors. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, everything in perfect order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems are beginning to appear after some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the model schedule was too fine is not a model of the collision. </seg>
<seg id="218"> From games of this type don&apos;t expect that counts the complex deformation and collision, but practically before no impact to any object, you do not have the faintest idea how to maintain your car, then it probably is not quite all right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typically, when a succession of overtaking or passing other cars in normal operation is sometimes only slightly cooked each other, but sometimes in a nearly identical situation then your car in feral piruetách. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even straight to smithereens. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the restartů system, while it&apos;s not particularly mind, but you get it reliably. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Restarts are designed so that if the smashing or go far out of line, you play back to latest landmark on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But the restartů is available in each race only five. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When is a space, you must race to start again from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is, rather, a widget for the case that something does not than you could rely on them exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="226"> But sometimes restarts do not help you, will need to learn is the section of the ex-works from memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The big game there is that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some of the curves, for example, the need to ride in a specific way, or simply not enough room in them. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Sometimes you meet on the &quot;civilian&quot; trucks always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, pátí, about five seconds or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> It sucks, in particular in situations where you can see how the opponent between two protijedoucími cars in front of you easily passes, while when you get there, you are already the wagons in a position that you have to detour around or slow down. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is one thing when you get to them, because it is a &quot;calculated&quot; to a given situation there is always just before your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents also have another advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> For the entire period of play you&apos;ll find several places where you, again without regard to time, always pass the same opponent on the same site. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Most hits in the conclusion of the game on a long bridge, where you&apos;re going the wrong way. </seg>

<seg id="278"> &quot;The Lisbon Treaty significantly enough to disrupt the balance between the individual institutions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I didn&apos;t expect that it would be such a tough war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will take five, six years before the situation settles a bit, relax and than all the players get used to my new role,&quot; she said sharply lecture at the Faculty of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> As far as their motto, &quot;Clearly and openly on Europe&quot; takes seriously, it showed in the first part of the lecture, which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations so clear and comprehensible manner, that it would have a number of speakers from the Law Faculty of the envy. </seg>
<seg id="282"> It also praised the work of the new Vicenová permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;The first appearance of critique that is dull, it&apos;s grey official that he cannot play any role, and I must say that all of the gear that the role had been very good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;It&apos;s a man who knows how to listen to twenty-seven Member States, good communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> A new post of high představitelky for Foreign Affairs and security policy, then explained as the answer to the question: &quot;who is the European Union? Which telephone number do I call? &quot;, i.e., as an important step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy towards the States, such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to disable the syrečky </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová devoted and agenda, which the European Council had lived, lives and will live in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Předloňské the Czech presidency a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs responded to the emerging financial crisis, solved the crisis by gas or held a summit on the Eastern partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the Government in this time then a large negative, which the Czech Republic very heavily damaged. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the Ambassador, &quot;a fact so crazy&quot; was not the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which shall be settled today. </seg>
<seg id="293"> In addition, still must be approved by a new 7-year budget of the Union, which is due to the present economic situation considerably. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors they prefer that the country will be supported by more and more, all of this is on the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Ambassador reminded their main slogans, which came to Brussels: &quot;Europe clearly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I really don&apos;t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How should the citizen to understand that I really be writing next in Brussels curved or circular cucumbers, bananas and of different sizes, or that we really need someone to disable syrečky. &quot;. </seg>

<seg id="305"> In the future the Union according to Vicenové waiting for mainly new tough rules for budgetary policies of member countries. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As a very real then sees the concept of a two speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than the new &quot;European Federation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have the euro-area countries and countries outside the euro zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area, we have also enhanced cooperation Institute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time were told to cooperate, only countries that they want and those that do not want to, whatever is nearby.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;The institutes will be more and it will be a hard two-speed Europe,&quot; expects Vicenová. </seg>

<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> IBM begins second century innovator of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone was looking for the word that most closely expressed the strategy of IBM, the closest would probably be &quot;long-term&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public is the IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet since its formation had already passed a hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this dlouhodobosti laid the first boss of the firm, a visionary Thomas j. Watson SR. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He coined the password that a number of the world&apos;s problems can be easily solved, if people are willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His motto, &quot;Think!&quot;, so the imprint, which will depend on the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that IBM had begun in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM means long-term thinking, continuous movement toward the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years because they remained loyal to its basic values and yet afraid everything else around them change. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It allowed us during our first centuries transform technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second round, we can achieve more, &quot;he said to the anniversary of the current Director of the Samuel j. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson in the 1930s had to take care of their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic-people from IBM had as one of the first American workers paid vacation, insurance from an employer, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system of remuneration of the best inventors, and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As detailed in the IBM i has a relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was from the beginning a genius in the extraction of talent-as one of the first international firms to abolish any discrimination, so that you could choose from. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In accordance with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan that Palmisana at the head of IBM in the next year would be followed by a woman-Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The IBM Act already thirty years, still holds the position of boss of sales, marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is the so-called jams, on-line brainstormingy, from which there is a lot of future strategies and innovation. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Not surprisingly, ideas is enough-in the company works almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Institutions with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> A fixed position in business provides the company a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, the institution should IBM concept rather than just technology firms,&quot; she said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of books about Rosabeth Moss Kanter of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but the company, which helps to solve business problems for the use of technology,&quot; said George Colony from the consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the name itself says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM-or &quot;big blue&quot; her because of her logo in the United States, familiarly nicknamed-one hundred years grew into one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is probably the most versatile technological company-develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting, and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holds the most patents from all u.s. technology businesses and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Her inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, bar code or a floppy disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year to become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking forward </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovation they taste customers and periods of-IBM, for example, did not work the bet on their own operating system, OS/2, the on-line service Prodigy or the IBM PCjr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If your business built on the movement forward, you cannot emotionally can tie up the past,&quot; poznamává to Samuel j. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM does not have problem to build its foundations on many platforms-and if not, then leave. </seg>
<seg id="346"> The difference should be from the competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Perspective technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> On the sales of IBM, the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of it consists of software and hardware. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Yet in 1990 with more than half the share of the most powerful representative of the hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $ 15 billion, during the same period it has invested $ 58 billion to purchase prospective technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In the investment continues from 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is acting according to a reference of its first head of the Thomas j. Watson, who, during the great depression, also increased the volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Yet it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact. </seg>
<seg id="354"> IBM&apos;S share price since the beginning of 2008 increased by 120 percent, rocket net profit the company is continually growing. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Corporate password IBM is changing everything, only their values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> It can therefore be expected that even if the came another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM: from the toilet of cheese after years in space </seg>
<seg id="358"> IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City, a hundred years ago, originally had a complicated name of the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The name IBM took over until in 1924-originally it was a tag used for the branch companies in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis for the later IBM gave the merger the four firms, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Owning the technology, such as the famous &quot;píchačky,&quot; then hours afterwards, the employee can record the arrival and departure. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who in 1930, also chaired the Supervisory Board of the company. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint has hired the chief rival of Thomas j. Watson, to help him with the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Leader of then were overshadowed by the founder of the IBM-at Watsonových thought is not yet built the advantage corporate culture and identity. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of machines for business-from kráječů of meat and cheese after the Treasury. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years, what Watson headed the company, doubled turnover to nine million dollars and began a large expansion of the company in all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson has been indispensable for the company so that after almost 40 years in the šéfovském Chair, it was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to manage flights into space-on mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man on the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers-a series of IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Classic &quot;pécéčko,&quot; which raised the computer standard, since named IBM 5150 it came on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers, Lenovo, the Chinese company bought the konzultantskou part of the firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote advice and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy, which in the last three years, IBM paid-is the concept of a Smarter Planet, &quot;smarter planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its aim is the clever use of technology not yet even unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport, or administration of the cities. </seg>

<seg id="474"> &quot;A game we they with only one experienced player, the rest were young men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But, in short, there&apos;s nothing to do, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;The rotation for the alternation of us rolled out and we couldn&apos;t resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had more to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="481"> How have the prices of tours since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 it was in what was then Czechoslovakia allowed only five State-owned travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM.XML, Recreational and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies at that time were sold in the overwhelming majority of only trips to countries of Socialist bloc, as travelling to the West was very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists as they traveled on a vacation to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A clear exception was the period from 1962 until 1972, when it was able to to travel to Yugoslavia, but the Yugoslavian regime brought to the West and the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the Socialist block (i.e., also Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely, either individually or in the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In the event that a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, so he needed a letter of invitation from this country, not otherwise individual path, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel agency at the time, offering package tours to the West, however, was the need to queue overnight with sleeping or in the travel agency &quot;known good&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Not so, however, not the end. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called foreign exchange the promise, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not granted &quot;politically unreliable&quot; people &quot;who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency, without foreign exchange promise so it was not possible to obtain financial resources (Western currency) on journey to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> By far the most common, however, the Czechs spent a vacation in the country, of which the result was a large number of huts and cottages, which the Czechs to take and this custom survives to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travelling Czechs so experienced since 1989, a real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While in the year 1989 was a vacation in EAST GERMANY or Bulgaria to our maximum, the Czechs spent abroad last year 4.5 miles. holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A great paradox that you already realize today is that the US is currently most popular in Croatia was not possible until 1989 travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> At the outset, 90. years of the last century following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge surge in short-term visits Vienna Austria or Germany in particular. </seg>
<seg id="497"> They couldn&apos;t get enough of czechoslovakians long trips to the West, each with at least wanted to see for a while. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris, sleeping in parks tours of Czechs in tents, as our former income were, so we can pay the hotel or guesthouse. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the travel of Czechs was by this time vození their own food, cans, salami, etc, to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible of the Czech Crown, giving our visitors could finally after many years of destítkách freely to buy Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and average wages rose, however, which resulted in around 1997, another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began regularly since 1997 to prepare tours Charter air services, air tours, thanks to options nasmlouvat quantity discounts in comparison with the past, incredibly had become cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s. years of the last century had already the Czechs enjoyed virtually all developed countries in the world, except the US, which continue to facilitate our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the large demand, dispatched from the Czech Republic, historically the first direct charter flight to the touch, it was in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From this year so every year vylétávají with Czech tourists spot charters to warm lands, this year&apos;s winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic into 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100 thousand Czechs per year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-Orange, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> 17. November 2008, abolished the U.S. visas for Czech tourists and thereby our country finally became the most advanced country in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, for the first time in the history of the Czechs also spent more than half their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of residence of more than 15 000. USD per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting has to find the President, again, but threatens to stalemate </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months is a Czech football without the President and there is a risk that the successor Ivan Haška led the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Still, there is no agreement, according to which the electoral regulations shall be followed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without it, neither does not vote on which of the three candidates will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Interest to lead Czech football to Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned from Office in June and, in his retirement called colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But in an era when Haškovi football slid back toward tit-svazovými between the two chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Full it showed 16. September, when a new President was to be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the general meeting to the National House in Prague-Smíchov left unnecessarily, because the negotiations remain blocked, and it wasn&apos;t just on the way to elections. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There is not a consensus, who has the right to vote, actually-if only the statutory representatives or officials of the credentials, full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> At this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Disputes but still exist in the electoral regulations. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Too clear to the situation of the nevnesl, or the Executive Committee, at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, does not, in essence, nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Look at the option of several times changed, but neuralgický the point is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to handle 3. bike, to eliminate the possibility of stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find another model,&quot; said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda in the leadership of the Association represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round to win one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the Chamber, for which he&apos;s running. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession, to win the candidate who receives the higher the sum of the percent of the vote from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech party promotes the condition that the winner must, when this percentage addition to obtain at least two-thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;But it would then make sense and she lost the two previous rounds, that would be completely refuted by the bicameral concept&quot; understands the objections of the Moravian parties Freedom according to which would be the best regulations don&apos;t stem and vote under the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes specified the electoral regulations of the suits of all candidates most of the Pelt. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I wish that voted for the maximum according to the articles of Association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;To nevymýšlely some wildcard nonsense as at the last general meeting,&quot; said the owner of the Victoria Plzeň, who&apos;s running for the first time, and in its observations, explaining, in particular, against the Pelt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains an optimist. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him, in Nymburk, the new Chairman, I know and believe that the candidates together constructively in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All passion calms down, where today&apos;s procedure for the national team at the European Championships.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will be again happy wave, it will be a greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; says jablonecký and former, who is from across the three largest experience in the management of football at both the professional and the regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is nearing. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope in an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is a lot of ambivalent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It&apos;s not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt to the rules.-assigned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may cause it to stop the general meeting again.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope that sanity will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> To the agreement of all parties have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some of the negotiations was allegedly happen directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the struggle will football ever complete the generals. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The air special, in which they move to Podgorica, inter alia, Vice-Chairman of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, namely from Prague because of technical failure in the morning takes off and looking for the replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee to the scene barážové retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Finally, maybe it will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which might be alleged on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Minister of education, youth and sports of Josef Telecommunication would like to persuade riven by the parties within the strongest sporting association in the country, to the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game&apos;s a lot: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazky. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into battle for the President, because they see a suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the Chief players in the grounds of Tomáš Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor should the fight Summit function. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If the quality of the adept existed, I&apos;m fighting for it, and I&apos;m not going into the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, unable to find anyone like that,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="552"> In a duel with Miroslav Peltou and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged by him, he tried to avoid in the way to the head of FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that, in the case of his victory, in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, which is on the agenda of the annual general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the long run would like to see an experienced and award winning Manager, who is not too linked with a football game. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;With some of the people who would come into consideration, I&apos;m talking about.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was crazy, some say that at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to be identified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;That I&apos;d like to change, &apos;&apos; he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Paclíkovi was now most of all do Peltovo conjunction with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association by Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is in the wings known as powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates to the general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For the Paclíka is so unacceptable that stood in the Chair position Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, so zakonzervuje the current state of and nothing would move forward in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, would help the football even more,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Referring to that Peltovo name years ago there was a corruption in the eavesdropping when investigating the affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what kind of prestige would football Peltovo the victory.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we also looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, but it also takes the perspective of his former statement that it would &quot;sell plzeňský Club if Pelta became Chairman&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the event that Paclík in the Thursday election triumphs, but could with Peltou imagine future cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="566"> The same is another candidate Rajchl, which Paclík is supported before the general meeting, which ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would have been the first who I&apos;d go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great ability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could see him as head of the team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But this would drive the Association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I also don&apos;t stick your nose where it can&apos;t do it,&quot; said Paclík, who in September raised much attention by standing behind the Commission citing the arbitration with the Luďkem Macelou, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík says that it would take over the management of the Association dared. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Refers to the ability of management to private companies since last summer&apos;s also Plzeň, which with its support in May was celebrated by the premiérový League triumph. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to make it in the football environment, something has changed, so has contributed to its particular culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To reduce the effects of certain interest groups, which should tend to influence disciplinary and appeals to the Commission, which goes up to the unsavoury situations,&quot; said Paclík, who expresses his dislike for example for sparťanskému boss Daniel Křetínskému. </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities should also considered tightening the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose use would be for political leaders lobbying for the sport received more money from the lottery tax. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key things that should be the new Chairman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If the taxation of gambling, how to declare political party, so I understand their reasoning, but must say where the money will go,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> A Paclík now its not even associated with the Plzeň Club, even though he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be &quot;non-partisan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is associated with Jabloncem, with the Prague Duklou. Rajchl </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It&apos;s not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;I can&apos;t see but no sense to someone clinging convert their shares in the Club and a year and a half there,&quot; says Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the electoral stalemate </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, intends to have FAČR the new statutes, which would, in future, definitely avoid disputes over the election regulations. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Jablonecký is official before Thursday&apos;s meetings in Nymburk optimist and believes that the election fight significantly dampen any of today&apos;s success of the football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta is now been made the choice promised that the representation and acquisition Finance intends to concentrate in the case of the election. </seg>
<seg id="587"> The choice before the last general meeting decided to go at the last minute, and he two-month postponement of the throw to their ideas about the management of football, he defended and presented in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people at all levels make football a long time and they expect that the President will be known on Thursday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;Feels that it is high time that the Association leadership,&quot; says the man, who is associated in particular with the jabloneckým Club, but a number of years he worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> I, therefore, believes that he has enough experience to Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Is convinced that the current problems with the choice is euphoria, which was at the time the Government of Ivan Haška. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, at the June general meeting approved the statutes, which were not as perfect as everybody thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If Númenor did not permit different interpretations, the President we&apos;ve had since September,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Just processing the most important document of the Civic Association began as a vějičku delegate. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become President, I&apos;ll take it as a personal challenge, and I&apos;m willing to take personal responsibility, if it fail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot be,&quot; says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Next they try to nevymezovat against their opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Earlier avizoval that he could imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognizes for its forensic education, and knows that his opponent was its first Vice-President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Long neútočil and Thomas Paclíka, who, on the contrary, to let the thread of dried Pelt. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;In football, something over a year, has had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;However, his attacks were unworthy of him and a lot of people in the election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;And so many of them now has doubts about its actual nature,&quot; he said to the man who supposedly Pelta address remains faithful to the proklamacím, which had already announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competition after representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a showcase of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I also tried to close all the Affairs, starting with the case of Bohemians or echoes of last year&apos;s corruption scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Then I went to the negotiations with the private and public sectors, to make enough money for the whole of football,&quot; said the candidate, 46, two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> If also promised that his arrival was to head the football would be no staff purges. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I&apos;d have to first get acquainted with the contents of the individual employees,&quot; said David at Strahov, where the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the current worst-case scenarios, covering Europe General meeting, believes that on Thursday they delegates to Nymburka. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If it is the only contentious point, how will be elected in the third round, so that we can migrate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Soccer needs credibility, there will only be finally have again their leader,&quot; remains Pelta two days before the possibly decisive on his funkcionářské career optimist. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that would FAČR began to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday former Vice-President the General Meeting elected Henry Rajchl, many people in the Association should be pleased. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl, promises that in the event of his election will work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to promote system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football field. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It also promised to solve the case against Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring to football more money and continue the work that was started by the previous President Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President, I&apos;d like to dedicate football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, a performance football after the youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I&apos;m not saying I&apos;d do everything myself,&quot; he said in an interview with Rajchl ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and I want in the Executive Committee to distribute competences so that each of the members devoted to a particular area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will give away the hard tasks to each of this segment to move football on the great step forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people would probably was pleased, because it started to work really hard and not just to criticize the work of others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement said he thought that would not stand again. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;I know that I&apos;m doing 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know, that it will have meaning and that I will have people who will be constantly crimping and questioning my every step,&quot; he explained why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people told me that I must not give up, because then it would give others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It&apos;s confidence, that I can&apos;t just throw away, &apos;&apos; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Motivates him and the continuation of the work started with Haškem. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;For those two years did a great job and I don&apos;t want it now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;They are of started processes that will have the reverb should be up in a few years, and I&apos;d hate to be stopped,&quot; he said with concern that in the case of the election of another candidate, Pelty should the situation on the Union to return to the time before the Haškem. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in fully, and that is the thing to me Mirek Pelta can&apos;t.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are mostly navázáni people who did not football that was only for those lucky ones.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not that someone for negligence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I&apos;m trying to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to do football for all, because then it will be all right everybody, and not just the privileged few,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Is refuted by the claim that he was the Czech President. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even though some people trying to argue otherwise, so I plan to do for the Moravia maximum.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider that the second League split to Czech and Moravian part of the whose winners would go to the League.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Valid should the current situation, where they are in the League only three Moravian units, which is a problem to the young players,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As the fight of the Chairman joined, and the Chairman of the Pilsen Club, Tomáš Paclík, dares you to estimate their chances of Rajchl election. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;But I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which I chose as its Vice-Chairman, and that for me is the clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, for his achievements as the saving of tens of millions of Crowns on negotiated contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiations on the loterijním law. </seg>

<seg id="651"> The book show is the most beautiful wellness on the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When the issue of Iris Meder in the past one and a half year on the objevné path, was in her bag to miss her bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> New back on the water, I looked up to a height of to the artistically shaped by the dome, swam across the marble putti (the Ant small naked boy child (with wings)), which it waited on the edge of the pool and admire the carefully restored art nouveau swimming areas. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If some of the Lido, in an instant, it has entered into his notebook-with notable details about how to build, and the history of the building. </seg>

<seg id="657"> the 46-year-old German is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The sport&apos;s power overstated, says Meder-only in the water, it&apos;s something else. </seg>
<seg id="659"> The anger is just that the fans of swimming must be content with the blue crowd and smell of chlorine, while meat for health may breathe in the smell of spruce forests or a narcotic to listen cheery chirps of birds in the Park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day, I asked, why was he swimming areas must always be so ugly,&quot; says Vienna Lady Meder. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;So I started to collect good swimming areas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The water level of the zdvojuje architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> Splashing in the pool and ethereal oils will for sauna-a factor of well-being is so large that it covers all of the senses, so Mrs. Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And when the founders were swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;instead of the floor has a man in the bath water.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;Is both transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the entire building.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths are smell like sulphur, Árpád at the Spa in Hungarian Békescsabě smells after fuel oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he got into therapeutic baths. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing alkaline bicarbonates, almost black, and whose deposits up to the skin, once just a man slips into the pool-a rather special experience wellness. </seg>
<seg id="677"> But also one place was Iris Meder in his quest for nice baths disappointed: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate lázně Luhačovice, hit the closed terrain. </seg>

<seg id="724"> The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: the Austrian Pavilion of the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won the price became the Vienna arts, remained empty and zpustnul. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is otvírán again as the exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> When knitting for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass Hall, bold strokes and new building materials, which are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World Exposition 1958 concise and its celebrated example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzerův Pavilion received when the Grand Prix d &apos; Architecture for its light and they towered, active construction of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Best known as an architect, so that also for the next World Expo Pavilion built in Austria. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary čtyřválcovým BMW-Palace plus as a key carried out minor building in Munich, eventually 1973 internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its as a temporary exhibition structure designed Pavilion for the World Exposition placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern train station), and have recreated in 1962 opened the Museum of 20. century-was named as &quot;the House of 20. of the century &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Appropriate for the museum building was not used, or spatially nor technically-lacking the walls for hanging up art exhibits, no satisfactory climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Yet it was used until the current art yet in Vienna of the new stand. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and deteriorate more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz Pavilion in an instant, is now the name of &quot;the House of 21. of the century &quot;and will in future be used as the Museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday night there opens the Museum Belvedere Palace, to which it belongs, the first exhibition-happy intention in every respect. </seg>

<seg id="739"> In addition to the contemporary art should be posted on the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruby restaurant of the foundations, should there be a café and bookshop, and had to be built to the Office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Close supervision, low budget. </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation was then Krischanitz ideal cast. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only that, sensitively reconstructed them and spread of Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbricha in Vienna, and won the competition, but because, at the Schwanzera, he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was extremely important for him to &quot;place&quot; in which &quot;almost every weekend&quot; at the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and also knew problems building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use of lost to its generosity and lightness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reconstruction were far bigger problems: the building was &quot;Catapult problems for energy,&quot; says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Window profiles, glass facades have been exchanged, used glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Chladové bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos filled ceilings rescued. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two underground floors provide space for new uses, flush mounted lighting channel between the building and the street lighting, handles to the entrance leads to the bridge-almost new construction, but still vznosný Schwanzerův Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original entrance door, the building is preserved in the old natřena anti-corrosive červenohnědém color tone. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And is exactly the same as he was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And it&apos;s all under strict supervision of the heritage and the low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often had to be found of the material which is good and cheap, and also liked the památkovému Office,&quot; says Krischanitz and points to a broken floor basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It&apos;s difficult to be with Pavilion, &quot;who came here from Brussels,&quot; he said recently, the typical &quot;Krischanitz Drop-in-the-City-History&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture he is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and wants to still &quot;give proper self-esteem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, but it is not the House of 21. the century nepatřičném the spot since most urban happy coincidence: in radius around Schweizer Garten is a completely newly designed &quot;Urban neighborhood at the main station&quot; with Office and residential houses. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps even to another happy coincidence: the House of 21. century could receive aid from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how to hear, this is with the city of the neighbourhood at in Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="827"> This message in Turkey and in Germany-the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and worry. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many German Turks it returns back to the ghost, which was long regarded as the dead: from the arson in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there is no comparable violence with right extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="829"> In Germany there are xenophobia about yet never in doubt. </seg>

<seg id="845"> What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is vulnerable, clarify the assassination in Mölln, Solingen in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Photographs of the burn in Solingen is deeply vryta in memory of Germans and Turks. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Since no other event has shown here living the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat to the Germans and that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence </seg>
<seg id="848"> But the bombings have made on the side of the Turks more pronounced sense of reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Don&apos;t repeat the errors of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press, it was mainly criticized the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to you in Mölln, survivors, visit. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Arrested after the attack in a telegram of condolence to Solingen sent the Turkish National President, but left at the Memorial Festival in Köln represented by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel when the Kinkelem-in his speech has calculated what charges the Turks will pay. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Quite so, as if the value of man according to the height of its taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Current news of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust many German Turks in local polities. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of the extensive clarification and new evaluation of those extreme terrorism in Germany this time requires open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Scandalous Bank in Zürichsee </seg>
<seg id="856"> Most Bank, Europe does not have a registered office in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS has suffered a financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then, sliding from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it has some German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So the Axel Weber certainly didn&apos;t think so. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his retirement from the leadership of the noisy Federal Bank happened in July known that arrives 2013 to almost the same spektakulárního a new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS-unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber had publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired respectability and said the friendly remarks towards future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;Die UBS its turnover&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September it was clear that everything goes differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> One dealer from UBS in London, walked around all the security systems of the Bank and approximately 1.7 billion euro zmarnil. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Board of UBS is since then also stunned-and they all ask: When finally coming Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> I already have known that Weber Bank from February 2012 may advise. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the Presidency of the Administrative Council takes over in may-not only in the year 2013, the Bank informed on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber will be hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Is not a banker, Professor of Economics and major banker and he would certainly have time to incorporate needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At the same time will take over then the responsibility for the strategy of the Bank, who once again has proved that he deserves the title &quot;Bank of the largest scandals in Europe&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because UBS is both great-until recently was the largest asset manager in the world-and sliding in both years from one scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, will not remain proud of the Swiss Bank was spared. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started as a financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The Image of the quiet, and a solid, but also vychytralého Asset Manager combines with the ambitious objectives: also wanted to mean something in the investment banking business. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So managed the UBS 2007 on one side with the 1.6 trillion dollars more money of wealthy clients than any other Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, has advanced as an investment bank, to the League&apos;s biggest banks </seg>
<seg id="880"> It made an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> A former banker and later a long-time Professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger says: &quot;their students I UBS claimed always as a model of good Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s point of view, a man asks: how I could so wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong considerably. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, was the first clear that something went wrong in the UBS properly. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In mid boss surprisingly resigned Board of Directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, knew why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Investment Bank Division squandered the Subprime-papers and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To withstand a Prowler, same UBS capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> But actually found investors, however, over which was recently still sneered: Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one even knew his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was just the first impact. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it developed the worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank had to admit the new billions in losses, the President of the Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best paid Executive Board Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, followed by a disaster: UBS was due to its bad investments for financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs to mandatorily convertible bonds, which could be a partner in a bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Whole Switzerland was shaken-as you noted, as dramatic for a small country, has on its territory the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all he was the balance sum of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again we could not save UBS&quot;, says Bank expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster follows another. </seg>
<seg id="899"> For several months in the tax dispute capitulated UBS with America and has shown willingness to issue data, affluent customers who, if possible, with the assistance of banks&apos;ve ended the tax. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she agreed with the payment of 780 million dollars-as the recovery of irregular profits from these transactions, including, and. </seg>
<seg id="901"> This confession, more or less openly, that helped the reduction of taxes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for rich clients: Halo discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was previously. </seg>
<seg id="904"> Followed the resignation of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of money customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the Bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in both the central business areas: investment banking for the poor speculation and in the management of assets for aiding the reduction of taxes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when things calmed down a little bit again, just as it was thought that UBS has once again recovered, here comes this unfortunate business quest: the only dealer zmarnil euro 1.7 billion before the Bank noticed that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it&apos;s clear: with the management of the risks in the investment banking it probably still isn&apos;t working. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;Case of Adoboli probably found that control risks has too few&quot;, says Martin Janssen, an economist and a Professor of finance at Banking Finanz Institute of the University of Zürich, Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The Financial Director of a large German bank is certain: &quot;the problem of UBS lies in the fact that it doesn&apos;t control the risks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was exactly her idea of the precautionary principle, which got off on the Swiss Bankers have long ago to become guard big properties of the world: none too great a risk, but security for the money-also from the parties of the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for steadfast reliability as the Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Headquarters for UBS in Zurich, to cliché good Swiss private banks-it is just a little bigger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> It&apos;s a classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its main office in Zurich, Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyšskému Lake, which is backed by snow-capped Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops, among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewelry, such as Tiffany &apos;s, here they find between the Swiss traditional trades such as ice Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries houses the Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank via Palast der Credit Suisse to an elite private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the reception hall you enter the UBS heavy otáčivými the door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are panelled in marble, in front of them is a huge leather chairs, in addition to the Bank&apos;s logo, a large signpost to &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of Swiss banks both by the Swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes-curb or betrayed, how determined the boss of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name would prefer to read in the papers, he concluded, like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two velkobankami shops. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS is probably too grown, primarily detect in investment banking, where, moreover, extend the Anglo-saxons. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss, it do not have more to tell. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if you had to adapt to the Anglo-Saxon ways.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Actually, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS has doomed her high profits and then disaster: no European financial Institute lost in the jungle around the Subprime as much money as the Schweizer Großbank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> October 15, 2008 was a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;In the center of the small coalition Government agreed to sedmimilionové the country to the greatest life-saving action in the history of his nation,&quot; writes author Lukas Hässig, in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, approved the politicians to save the bankruptcy standing velkobanku. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How did this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If the talks with the Swiss Bankers, the problem arises mainly in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three Swiss velkobank to massive concern. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The Bank, which has already resulted in a merger was too large to small Switzerland-and still further grew. </seg>
<seg id="935"> While allowing that the two different banking predecessor UBS complement each other: one rich, but sleepy Bank in Zurich with a focus in management of assets and the poorer, but internationally more involved. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly they came internacionalizovaní investment bankers looking to many money, with which they could spin a roulette wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> With this rise of UBS are associated with two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a team of the future,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the person managing the feelings around the stomach, which is from Bank of science has developed a completely up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel was to end on Wuffliho. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Wuffli and at the end of may has committed crucial errors: &quot;I thought that its models are a reality,&quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> This much is clear: the pride of the preceding fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of UBS clearly recall the meetings of executives, on which the koncernový Chief Wuffli said again and again the same password: Knock, Goldman Sachs down from the throne. </seg>
<seg id="946"> American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Alleged &quot;League Tables&quot;, waiting list, which documents the success of banks during that period. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It tried to UBS on the location closest to the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> A few steps she had succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In trade with the currency and stock market took part in the game at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Corporate Advisers, who were instructed to stress, however, one weakness: an interest in international trade, in the speech of the bankers &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, I think there is a big gap for the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has about gaps in US mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To this gap, ventured to UBS to adventure, which almost cost her existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, invested as the Bank itself and based her Fund to ensure the risks to American Subprime investments. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Developed into a massive machine that securities přebaloval on American mortgage loans and forward further-but he also kept the risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also, when other banks had long sought a way out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought them, &apos;&apos; says a banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> How big is the euphoria and deep fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager behind the other had to leave, when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions in UBS became a katapultovacím seat and to this day the pick fleas out. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the velkobanku now has an uncontrollable work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for the Bank, all of which are close to the business models were gone. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: the end to investment banking, concentration on the administration of the assets, the return of Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Completely so far while (still) doesn&apos;t want to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But investment banking has strong ubýt, it is now clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday the Bank wants new boss Sergio Ermotti introduce the world of their future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, when surprisingly broke up with predecessor Grübelem. </seg>

<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What he wants to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions which the Axel Weber have already considered. </seg>

<seg id="1323"> &quot;That is going to the Park, only a maximum of Zuccotti status of members of the Department.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1347"> Mr. Browne said that in the Park approximately 142 persons were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests took place because of the &quot;Organization of riots and resisting arrest,&quot; he clarified. </seg>

<seg id="1362"> Unions representing hundreds of school ancillary workers who have lost their jobs last month, in the middle of planning to sue the city. Argues that the dismissal was not necessary and it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, visiting the poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Lawsuit is probably the last option, which the unions in the area of District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse the decision on layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> 7th October lost work of the six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city. Their release of the leading members of trade unions described as retaliation of the city for him last spring, did not allow access to fund health care managed working teams, by which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Leaders of the town, this accusation categorically rejected. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a meeting of the Municipal Council, held last month, said Education Minister Dennis m. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> One of the members of the Council immediately countered that the budget is nowhere specifically was the release of ancillary staff. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Representatives of District Council 37 announced that has already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of education, that it will be sued. On Wednesday called a press conference, where he formally brought before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The two defendants were in the process will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of education, while the claimant will be eight displaced workers, of which all are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had seen action, and therefore the individual accusations will express. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to the proposal the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, unions focused on quantities released in the poor parts of town, thus wanted to support his claim of unfair negotiations. Holding the view that the poor schools have more assistants, because they are already long denied adequate financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> They point out that while in the schools in Staten Iceland, nepropouštělo, and in parts of the Upper East Side, Brooklyn, in the part of District 23 in the Brownsville came on the work of 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was placed even 46 assistants. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Recalls that in school Public School 36 in Harlem lost work of five of the eight assistants, although this is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. In the application, says: &quot;it&apos;s not about the neighbourhood full of wealthy parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the schools Public School 36 this year was reduced by 3,26% and the school also lost money when the city changed the method of calculating the bonus funds for each logged-on a poor student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> In addition, the unions argue that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written in the document authorizing the release of the parent coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> In the document, it was used to describe the action, the word &quot;excess&quot;, i.e., cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the movement of teachers from the payroll of the school into a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released,&quot; says the draft complaint, &quot;and not only moved into the database on the position of workers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally, it appears that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something that concerns the rebellion in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> This, however, there had been a revolution succeed, long ruling dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of units of the United States ended. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Commission for international relations of the Senate to decide on the terms, which supports the President, John Kerry (mass.), together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate Libyjcům for their successful rebellion and to thank us troops for &quot;bravery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This Declaration we appreciate the courage people of Libya, who began with the conversion of their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The said sentence might appear innocently, but no debate concerning Libya, when the have not been easy. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly quarrelled among themselves and with the White House on the text of a statement series for approval or rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain introduce resolution authorizing limited the use of u.s. armed forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it is in the Senate, never nehlasovalo. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> However, the same day he was in the House, this proposal is rejected, the Chamber rejected the measure, which would stop financing us operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The American Mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory-Congress criticized the way in which President Obama mission control, but its members apparently nedráždilo enough to stop him in his actions. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The hesitancy of the Congress finally ran ahead of the next event. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and 20. October was killed by Gadhafi. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Nato&apos;s mission officially ended 31. October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> It is now the Senate might be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Commission for international relations in its Declaration &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and admirable tenacity, which have invested in an attempt to free his people&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who are involved in the operation of the protection of the Libyan population, for exceptional bravery and professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> In a statement, also &quot;confirms the national interest of the United States on the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Obtains a new proposal from the full support of the Commission for international relations, or legislators once again divided into two halves, as was the case for the approval of the June draft? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Against the last version, built by Senator Richard g. Lugar (IND.), the main representative of the Republican party in the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has yet seen. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the House this week to vote on the amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlattem (Va), will be the first amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or any other topic, which will be put to the vote the entire House or Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers, meanwhile, despite substantial efforts to push its proposals to the voting. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattův proposal is the only one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched a wide range of different themes. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some of them were the same-the same proposal submitted by the House of Commons and the Senate-and others are just a minor variation of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Just in the House you can find at least 15 version of the Appendix of the balanced budget and the other a handful who liked to &quot;regulate federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters-especially beginning with the Republicans, who want to enhance the reputation-can boast of their &quot;autorstvím&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require of the appendix relating to the balanced budget vote, the House of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March 58 senators voted in favour of non-declaration to support the creation of such amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> In addition to the budget wants to discuss a few members and limit the number of periods in which could serve the members of Congress, while José e. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods, which may be in the function of the President. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Representative Jesse l. Jackson, Jr. (ill.) offered a number of appendices, which would, inter alia, guarantee the right to quality education and health care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Permanent banning marriage proposal remains Appendix couples of the same sex as the appendix to prohibit the burning of national flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the nullification of federal laws in the event that they will stand up to two thirds of the States. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Although it seems that they are members of the Congress in the design of the various additions to the very active, in comparison with previous years, however, are not significantly from the average. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111. The Congress offered 77 amendments, while in the 100. The Congress there were 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of 90. 20. century, when the members of the Senate, according to the statistics of the library offered every two years, more than 150 additions. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> However, they were much more successful than the current politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment was added-27. Appendix-was ratified in 1992, but in fact Congress was proposed in 1789. </seg>

<seg id="1442"> But you can do it, you put it together and come back even stronger than before. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Military units are faced with compassion rather than with the respect </seg>

<seg id="1451"> I&apos;m sure that the organizers thought it was good. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that, Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But what I saw did not respect. It was a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Completely the opposite impressions just illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and often aloof, sometimes celebrating the American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Army bezbřeze zahrnováno praise for his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But this praise, saying the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly acts as if the individuals in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all the victims,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean b. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon leave. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way some of us can support, is to put us in the role of the unfortunate souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This topic is very sensitive for the Army Commander, who don&apos;t want to appear ungrateful or spoil the relations with the public which they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also realize that anger, which had to face troops returning from Vietnam, once was much worse. </seg>

<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative responses,&quot; said Cancian their sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The army&apos;s concern stems from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Success on the field of battle rarely gets recognition in the country, which has its own army just a little awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a few of his own benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation have already nevážíme the army&apos;s heroism as was common during the second world war,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded us troops in Afghanistan. </seg>

During the following months, however, their number has grown to 28-25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army after the notification of these útků failure in the investigation, punishment and any pursuit for justice. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke contends that the neck the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army&apos;s direktivním system,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the pursuit of the imposition of measures against such action? The high command. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also asserts that since February has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could be included in other lawsuits filed in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Its strategy: rather than gathering all the charges in this case-packed all eggs in one basket, as she says-an application in several different cases, if needed, to pressure nepolevil. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> A team of Defense Ministry of defence leads State representative of the United States Neil MacBride, which together with its collaborators initiative to reject the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Judicial documents, which won the Newsweek, are discussing a strategy of defence in detail-in principle, that current or former soldiers, the army cannot sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 called as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injuries will suffer from the soldiers in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged injuries relating to military service, the complainant,&quot; it says in the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> However, things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Although women still officially not serve in combat, it&apos;s just semantics: in modern wars can be hard to find a course that is the line. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly more pronounced role, particularly in the area of communication with civilian women occuring in a war zone. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Result: between the wars was 150 soldiers of the female sex-two-thirds of them directly in combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> Now is the time to have been modernised and in the army, &quot;explains Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> In my fight is not alone. In addition to her case dealing with three other legal representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The law school Yale prepare visitors veteránského seminars on the legal service of the action on the four main military Academy for developing atmosphere promoting hatred for women. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Irrespective of the non-profit organization American Vietnamese veterans gather supporting documents for their action aimed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorders&quot;, which was supposedly established for victims of rape to the army a pretext to their release, according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women&apos;s Action Network, this is a perfectly normal practice. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Her group already in December filed a proposal for action against a State Organisation for negotiations with the veterans, which he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should occur in the processing of requests for help from the people who claimed to have been in the service of sexually infected. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> In Congress, presented nine separate proposals, which has made the Group of Senators and members of Parliament from both political parties, and proposed a number of remedies in those measures. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence, the Ministry of defense was in 2010 reported 3 158 sexual attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, wanders in the Pentagon&apos;s own estimates, this number is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents occurring in a given year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> In a report issued in March is dismantled and the rate of criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the Court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army-which is half compared to the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Prosecutors in the case of the Deputy Burkeové describe the attacks as just the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Private first class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was to follow. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> During the night, he says, was asked to give details about his rape repeated eleven times to various members of the police, physicians, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape and her bed was found the attacker&apos;s blood-from the, which he has done on his arm. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, graduated from Lymanová hearing before a judge, during which it considered issues relating to that on the day of the attack she loved with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It ordered six persons as witnesses on the reputation of the spoke in favour of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when a sentence,&quot; says Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I had the feeling that right there on the spot, shouting,&quot; Ellie-I ran out of the courtroom. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;Put me to a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I was his commanding officer said: it wasn&apos;t his court. Was mine. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lymanové--visit a military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnosed personality disorder, making her as unfit for duty. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 she was from the army without honor and therefore not eligible for výsluhu released. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whatever the case, the applicants &apos; Lymanové and other moves to the next phase or not, it&apos;s run on the long track, says John Turley, Professor of law at the Law University of George Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he notes, &quot;from my point of view, should be able to refer to other phases of consultation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Between them and indeed, however, is the doctrine that has been criticized since the first time she saw the light of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is decades behind, because their duties do not indicate to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrent devices. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot;the odds are heavily against them. .. but it is important for them to try.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> To change occurs only when the good people are willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, collected hundreds of other people ready to take action and begins work on other causes relating to this topic. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We are with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whichever comes sooner. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: how scientists are exploring on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, the Braivik, who confessed to killing červencovému rage, after which left in Norway 77 dead, attended her first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik to act alone, not lonely in cyberspace, certainly: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing groups on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy-just go to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that to get it, it&apos;s not really that difficult,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recently released report of the British research team, which concerned the European digital populism. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that the scientists enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the pages and with absolute precision to determine the demographic you are looking for a group, something they do public relations workers for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlett&apos;s team across Europe found half a million fans, right-wing groups, whereupon they focused attention and sent them the ads. However, instead of through their enchantments to the newly created group or offer them some dietetic products, urged them to fill in a questionnaire in which were questions relating to the level of their education, the relationship to violence and optimism due to their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 various right-wing groups in 11 European countries-without ever having to leave the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It&apos;s a whole new way of conducting research,&quot; observes Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which let him get to the growing rate of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But on the other hand, &quot;those who its on-line activism combined with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly hiding behind the screen of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work team of the DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new instrument in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research teams, health professionals, scientists and political scientists use these pages to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding status updates, news on the walls and pressed the buttons &quot;I like it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Facebook says more than 800 million active users. Each day, on average, provide three different data, which from this social network is literally &quot;the information Supernova&quot;, which stands for the development of many new research. The number of academic theses, in whose name contains the word Facebook, increased as compared to the situation five years ago, to nearly 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some of the scientists is the magic of Facebook, it gives them the possibility to study the people, without having to bother somewhere on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Previously, if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You would have to get to the party, but you would never allow this&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;All this Facebook hooked up-just go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others argue that the page can offer a way to identify the socio-medical problem and avoid them. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> In a recent study, Dr. Megan Morenové of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about this topic. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Morenová proposes that the peers page monitoring and students came in with an offer to help the student who publish too many drunken forms. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;The problem can be solved if you can&apos;t diagnose him,&quot; said the Washington Post, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morenové and the Director of the Center for health, behavior, and development of children in the children&apos;s Research Institute in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We found a way to identify at-risk children that we did not have a chance to appear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook alone constantly sonduje the data of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The information team pages prepared by the statistics relating to the context and the forms of relationship, of St. Valentine&apos;s day, voter turnout in 2010, and the coefficient of satisfaction of the people (mainly with the use of the information to which they had access-Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the page should have their information available for research, and the treasure of the other). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the page is monitored, whether they like it or not-in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it should be a page to provide your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if Facebook users to become part of the research, which they don&apos;t even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Scientists have clearly-defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data, however, are accessible to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I think most users would even scientists can look into their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, London Knowledge Lab, the sociologist, a study in 2006, which was carried out with the use of public facebookových the walls of their students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;When it came to them, so that the information is only between them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then also consider the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even when off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Facebook is not possible to check, how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What do you say on Facebook, and what do you do outside of Facebook, they are two quite distinct things,&quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why you Selwin, who spent long years, research new technologies, he thinks that the pencil and the notebook remain the best possible tool that can be used in research. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;When you go into the real world and you&apos;re talking to real people, it&apos;s something that can&apos;t be replaced, &apos;&apos; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research should be about the company and social activities-and the hell a lot of social activity still takes place off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, during his first public court hearing in Oslo himself described as the &quot;warrior&quot; the resistance &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I&apos;m a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templar Knight,&quot; he said before the Court, where 500 people gathered. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object against the Court of Justice, because the mandate you have granted the organization promoting the ideology of hatred, and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I confess to their acts, but I&apos;m admitting to nothing for them to blame.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika during this she said, because &quot;he didn&apos;t want to give Breivikovi the opportunity that this hearing was used as a platform from which he could preach his views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused to Breivikovi, who brought a speech prepared, at the end of the hearings to address the relatives of their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered police to Breivika held in custody another 12 weeks, his has banned any contact with the media for 4 týnů and announced that the final authorities for a period of eight weeks, full control over all of its visits and all merge. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some come in the hope that Breivikovi will be able to look into the eyes of others, therefore, to ensure that it is kept tightly under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> They all attended in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought it looked cool and simply,&quot; said komentátorovi, one of the survivors of the attack NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was not pleasant, but for myself I can say that after what I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally pushed back a little bit farther.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, he remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. On arrival and departure of the building without regard present žurnalistům and surviving in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the bizarre idea that Breivikově is part of a larger movement &quot;resistance,&quot; judge naznal that is not crazy, and noted that there is no evidence that he had any accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> For someone may be the consolation that the attacks of the 22. June appear to be the work of a single group of extremists and not radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> However, it automatically does not diminish the grief and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wish you to fell like a monster, but it is not so,&quot; said the relative of one of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;If Yes, everything is much simpler.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobsem on in the movie to theaters this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> As soon as Steve Jobs 5. October died, began to discover the views of people who compared with Henry Ford-and chose him for his genius, the greatest modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> The recently re-invented Jobsově conversation, which was oprášen for a special film, who&apos;s heading to theaters this week, it will be for all the Apple fans, the fact that his creative mind perfectly understand business processes and work flows for standing behind its products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was an idealistic and hip, a member of the self-proclaimed hippie, but also pedantským the organizer and the man who every detail coordinates to the smallest detail-he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from &quot;the idea that it is actually a great idea from 90 percent of their work. [but] a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way to bite work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995 he worked for Bob Cringely on the TV show, the triumph of the sighting, which dealt with the dawn of the personal computer. During the filming took place, more than an hour of conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At the time, had already been ten years since he was forced to leave Jobs Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and impatiently looking how the general public will take the internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In the TV show was eventually used a short part of the whole Cringelyho interview and on the original copies of the interview was rumored that lost in the transfer. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Shortly after Jobsově death, however, the VHS copy found in the režisérově garage. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového slide, Steve Jobs: the lost interview, which is heading into selected theaters this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who was famous for his reluctance to provide more Jobs for the talks here is surprisingly enthusiastic, that thus on its technological philosophy and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And it also shows a very thoughtful man. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four times during the interview, between question and answer there is a longer pause-10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how the Jobs the answer perfectly considers that what that describes you and accurate as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when the surface of the leaves when perfectionism Jobsův Cringelyho matters is impatient, and popohání him to quickly get to important issues and topics. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The interview was filmed before the era of Pixaru, iPod or iPhonu and appear in it frighteningly prophetic ideas, Jobs, evaluate what others are doing society good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> One thing is actually reading a posthumous assessment Jobsovy career, but on the Jobs, which we see here as rewarding the dreamer in the flowering of his genius, is something raw and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Has his own vision of how a case can and should look like. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> It didn&apos;t take long, and after his thoughts, he also put into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of the seven scenes from the lost interview &quot;, which certainly is worth noting: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How to learn to drive enterprise: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the years of business, I always asked: why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: No, it just does. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business, not in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I found out. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Liposuction continues that describes its efforts to simplify the accounts in the company Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> He was totally confused of how they have been recorded costs-often begin with the word &quot;standard cost&quot;, the amount thereof could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go their own way-has developed an automatic tool which guarantee that they could trade costs determine during the fly. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How did prank to the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs remembers the &quot;Blue box&quot;, which was built by Steve Wozniakem-a device that people give effectively hack into the phone company and free call anywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> On the device, it was written in the past, but already many Jobsovo enthusiasm, when Blue box describes as an instrument of power, is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Tells how to Wozniakem have tested the device using the paid phone, and during a call to let the transfer from one network to another, while Wachovia to reap the greatest possible number of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;At least we like this way furtively through it belonged in circles around the world, so when we then shouting something to the paid phone, there&apos;s a minute later from another phone at the door,&quot; says Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we have found that they can build a thing, which is able to manage the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Alone we made a tiny little thing that could control a much larger giant-it was an incredible experience and I never emerged without her Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues the description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost dragged to the end. Through the Blue box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked about whether it would be able to speak with the Pope, with the best flying Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Gradually drafted the increasingly above the status of members of the Catholic Church in the middle of the night to talk with an American diplomat, and only just before i woke up to the phone itself, the Pope, with a pair of rozchechtala and the receiver. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> How to be in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlettem): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> When he was 12 and looking for spare parts, so that he could build a-, found in the phone book number on the Bill Hewletta and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Not long after their 20minutovém the conversation already had Jobs provided in the summer a brigade of Hewlett-Packard Company. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;Incredibly influenced me. It was the only company that I knew at the time, and shaped my views on it, what kind of company is and how to treat their employees. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a trunk, CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> As a teenager I&apos;m HP went higher and higher, fooling around, and he began writing programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> What&apos;s making the upgrade: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several Jobs during the interview, he speaks about how to invent new products at runtime. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> In the early days of his career, when he went to sell a couple of plates with printed circuit boards, one customer asked to forge together a whole computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Available only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled and delivered the finished device. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> If it was later in the company of Apple, recalls the problems faced in the development of the computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember how we were quite a wild fight. .. they shouted at me, it would take five years [build a mouse, which would cost US $ 300] when I got tired, I went outside and found a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> About 90 days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $ 15. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> How big companies there is breath: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs carefully predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision of the zakolísá and lose market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Let&apos;s say that you work for the companies IBM, or Xerox, so you better copier or printer, and what&apos;s next?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Do you have a monopoly on the market, so the company company cannot be successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> At the moment it is sales and marketing, so companies šéfují the people who have to worry about this, as people have to worry about their own products are vyšachováni from the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Technological genius who led the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products-skill and technical knowledge are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That&apos;s exactly what happened in the Xerox ... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have literally the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Could be 10 times bigger than it is, could be Releases of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> However, instead of the victory zadělali on failure. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Taking innovation as a form of art: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;Between a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way and a lot of work ... and what a great idea evolves, so changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> During that time, you&apos;ll learn a lot about him. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> You must agree to the entire series of compromises-certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do to do either. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You must have in mind constantly 5 000 things-the different concepts-and put them together. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, depends on the taste-you&apos;re trying to think of the best thing that humanity has called into being, and in a certain way, is trying to reflect on what they are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists are copied, but the best artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> I have never been ashamed of it, that I&apos;m the best ideas to burgle. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The company was so amazing, and the Macintosh successful, therefore, that the people who work in it, they were excellent musicians, poets, artists, naturalists, historians and coincidentally at the same time also the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it weren&apos;t for computers and new technologies could be amazing in all other sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas were having dinner with the opponents of the law on health care, at a time when their case in court </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection against the law on health care, President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the gala dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which will be before the Court participate in the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases to be discussed was action by 26 States of discrediting the radical revision of health care, which last year approved by the Congress-a law which mobilized conservative activists around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed that the proceedings be heard. In March, however, expects a 5-hour negotiations whose outcome still more unsettling the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and at the time of issue of the decision will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> A lawyer, who stands before the Court of Justice and will seek to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George w. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clementova law firm PLLC, Bancroft, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner, the Federalist Society, a group that has long been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the law, the so-called zpochybňujících. The National Federation of independent business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor of the was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which they are in the process of huge financial resources are at stake. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner took place in the Washington Hotel several hours after the debate on the topic of the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> He participated, among other, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and endorsed by the opponents of the law on health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> And the placing of guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It&apos;s not new: this pair of judges with the actions of the Group participating in the Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And certainly it&apos;s not about anything, it would be contrary to the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, these justices relieved of the obligation to respect principles of behaviour, which are subject to a lower federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If it does not, however, would be their behaviour include: under the principle of the C4, which says that &quot;a judge may participate in the actions, which are related, and other organizations in order to obtain funds, however, the judge must not be speaker, guest of honour, nor must it be placed on the programme of action.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms cast in the case, and also a company with a huge financial interest in this case, richly enough alerted the activists calling for ethics in Government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code behavior is contrary to the claims of several judges of the Supreme Court, acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, President of the organisation of the Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were drinking and having dinner on the societal benefit, together with legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss your case before the Court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs of all claims to the cast, which is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas to his critics have demonstrated little understanding and told them that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups, such as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Thomas wife Ginni is a highly built a conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical issue has mainly judge Elena Kaganová and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kaganová worked as the General Prosecutor for the Government of President Obama, when he first appeared before the Court arguments against the law. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Critics of the Kaganové of her pushing to renounce participation in the case, and argues that if so many fought for the law to now be disinterested. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kaganová not given any indication that she was about to resign. </seg>

<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, ADB Director-General of the Bank, based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to assist in the rapid recovery of monetary bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Warned that the States of the Group of the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] all European problems are &quot;too calmly,&quot; and said that the Asian financial assistance in combination with the European leadership and resources will help to defuse the prolonged collapse of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We&apos;re all in this together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So it is useful to anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis,&quot; he said during the interview for the Financial Times on the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia is, perhaps, to a certain extent protected, but is certainly not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So, if China and India can help, they should do it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> European monetary Association is already several months severely tested when a major debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, borrowing costs have risen dangerously Italy and the Government of Italy and Greece, have withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The growing debt crisis in Europe raised fears that it could download again the world economy into recession, and began appearing to call the newly thriving leading economies together and helped the euro area to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag predicted that all the Asian support will be routed through the IMF, but noted that the mutual assistance-such as buying bonds Fund financial assistance of the European Union, institutions for the European financial stability-the Asian partners of European countries provided more negotiating options. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that &quot;India will do what he can,&quot; to help the euro area because its own economy now suffering a downturn in exports and vyschnutím to the influx of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants to be the euro area remained unstable and restless,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1742"> Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian, they assist European economies when they are forced to face its own serious economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the US, he said that it would be politically very difficult to explain the assistance for Europe 1.2 billion population of India, 800 million of them live on $ 2 or less per day. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> The warning from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the field of defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress get put under the boiler, when warned that the looming automatic budget cuts may undermine national security and cause financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembling lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon will have to so spend the budget reduction of $ 450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a reduction of a further US $ 600 billion, if Congress fails to conclude an agreement relating to the expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of such cuts would be devastating for the whole resort,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham &apos;s, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment causes 23% flat-rate decrease and stop many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Because of the way the huge reduction in use by this ill-judged way, it is not possible to carry out most of our building or ship&apos;s projects-you can&apos;t buy only three quarters of the buildings or ships. In addition, would result in serious damage to the other modernisation efforts, &quot;Panetta wrote senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We are Also forced to separate many of our civil servants, and, since the reduction take place so rapidly, we also have to almost certainly civilians sent to compulsory leave, to be able to fulfill the requirements of the target.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes can shatter the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously impair its readiness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Finally, the cuts to affect the combat units, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas, these obstávka directly affect the operation, will be adversely affected by substantial changes in the other budgets,&quot; said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The cuts even in the contractual personnel, which will result in the delay of negotiated contracts that support the war efforts of our people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;Reduced the statuses of paid employees, of which will flow and delayed payments to vendors and the subsequent disruption of legal and political aid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two Senators wrote off the Panettovi ten days ago and asked him about the details regarding the possible impacts on the automatic spending cuts in the Ministry of defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of the obstávky at the Ministry of Defense could cause rapid degradation of the United States as a world military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are strictly against this tough measures,&quot; senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when make Panettův letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;It is not the conclusion that we could live, and it is certainly below we do not sign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> &quot;Remains to be seen whether the Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and will reinforce the voices calling for the Pentagon&apos;s omission from the list of cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta was recently in talks on possible cuts to the increasingly more open, although he switched to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets of Congress and the White House, so he knew that the real fight. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference organised by the minutý week Defense Minister suggested a brief image of what the resort waiting-the shell of the military, inside which, however, will miss the core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It will be like a ship without Marines.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It will be like a Brigade without ammunition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It will be like the air force without trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It will be like a paper tiger, such as army barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission,&quot; said Panetta at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;As a result, it will be welcomed aggression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In the annex supplied with the letter Mccain and Graham&apos;s Panetta specifies how the reduction will have resulted in &quot;significant operational risks: late response to the crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the drops is this and deployment throughout the world; implied an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Panetta also said that some of the biggest defense projects could wait for termination, including those, which are already being tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> On the list, for example, the project, the planned new aircraft F35 bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, new coastal combat ship and new ground combat vehicle, which wanted the army and Marine Corps to replace the humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stopping the further development and testing of the aeroplane F35 would save over the next ten years to $ 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the military, which is important for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to tell a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A cursory glance at the recent newspaper headlines suggests, how serious and pervasive lies and deception in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that he sexually molested several women-both parties claim that the other is lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Administrators at the University of Penn State were accused of perjury, though they tried to hide the records that a retired football coach of sexually attacking a boy. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been caught, how running a microphone says US President Barracku Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> A lie can destroy the career and zacloumat stability of many countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> New York Congressman Anthony Weiner and Internet flasher making fool has published information that was immediately refuted by the unquestioned evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged that exploited the finances of his campaign in order to conceal his illegitimate attempted ratio. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And no one would never forget the media circus, which tore around Bill Clinton, when he lied during the second period, in function of their sexual relation with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Everywhere, with stories about cheating in school and at the University. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There are cases where teachers give themselves their students test answers, just to look good in their studies. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentoři who should learn to the contrary, they send a message that a lie and deception is acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How many scams are occurring? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Studies show that in one single day lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Suppose that many of them are full of lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreign people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in my life lied three times. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Determining the lies, or &quot;detection of lie&quot; is the necessary skills that you should acquire each, whether from personal or work reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, a Charade, when a man screams: &quot;I got you&quot;. Detection of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and philosophy. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of research is that most of the old myths about the lies has been refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liar you can look in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> It&apos;s not that zadrhávali, koktali, blush or ošívali. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> However, the nevyvozujte of it, that it is somehow difficult to detect liars espy and. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Trained the lies he can reveal the truth of the sentence structure, small expressions on his face, the way of creating questions and their timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge of the extensive and developing sectors related to the detection of lies and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skills, which can be easy to learn, and in today&apos;s complex world, you can help-especially if your responsibilities include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiation or leadership. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liar can read in the other, they are still wary, direct their emotions and intuitively realize, as the other party accepts. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> From research we know that extroverti is a lie more often than introverti men making more &quot;adopted by&quot; lies, while the women say more lies &quot;aimed at the other&quot;-mostly because to protect someone&apos;s feelings-that married people lie less often their partners than single people (but the lies that they are usually &quot;outrageous&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Also, we know that if you are perceived as a sinner, the others feel less guilty when you&apos;re lying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How do I know that someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, watch the normal behavior of the body. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;initial observations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Thanks to him, will have a subsequent findings with what to compare. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Note the posture the body, its funny, work with your voice. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know, if someone normally taps his feet constantly, you wrongly accused of lying only because the middle of the meeting starts tapping his feet. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and neverbálního behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider it, however, only as warning signals, not as evidence of the lies. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People speaking a lie may stop to move the upper half of the body, as he tries to remember his made-up story, the toes bend over to get to the door, to the East, significantly change the posture or make known &quot;relief after the end of the interview&quot;-an a great relief it and change the position, when is a difficult confession for them. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The people conducting the interviews are often issue a false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also feel the body language. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Famous is a story about how Scott Peterson once slipped and used the last time when he argued that the murdered woman is alive, which began a nationwide search for her body. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Klamající individuals may also express coldly: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with that lady ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or difficult question of all be repeated. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal characters are only very slight. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Anyone can use a lot of &quot;zmírňujícího language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;well ... to be honest ... from what I know ... According to the best of my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In fact, such a reply too know and often regards the other warning signal. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic, which would reveal any lie, but it is possible to learn the skills, by means of which we can lie down. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Using these skills will have one more chance, that in his personal work and buys a liar and to the phisher. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> A controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after what appeared a threat of delay the approval of the US Government </seg>

<seg id="1837"> Lawmakers in Nebraska, however, opposed this plan, and have been considering the introduction of legislation that would have forced the company to not hit the region of Sand Hills and into the vodonosné layer of the Valentine, the main source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Existing studies on the environmental impact, as ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project will only have little negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry, said Inspector-General of the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focusing mainly on two questions. </seg>

<seg id="2047"> Makes you more pressure? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest show, which we showed in the last 21 years, arose within a few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have some great show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to the forms of the concert at Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> In fact, we are looking forward to the concert too. </seg>

<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends go surfing at Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places for surfing. And so we learn about Costa Rica, through the people who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> If you look on your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many of the songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Whereas, we never played, we have no restrictions on what they could do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We&apos;ll try to show you what the best show with a variety of songs. We&apos;ll try to play a couple of songs from each album and imagine our fans a good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never neopakujete repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes a different structure, therefore it is difficult to choose which songs we play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three in the Repertoire of songs that we have long advertisers, we focus on them and we also surprise, because considering why we love and that we may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> So for us, the show more interesting, and therefore I think that it is more interesting to people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Following the tour celebrate 20 years of artistic career. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, it is hard to believe everything you did? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, that&apos;s for sure. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we&apos;ll be in one large rock group and that we stay in it for more than 20 years. It sounds like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We realize how much we have been given and moves us, that we can continue to play together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love each other and love making music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We&apos;re lucky that we can look at the place, which we&apos;ve always wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> We could not have gone better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What you meant that you were an important part of the formation of the genre grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> For us, that we can be part of this group, in which they are represented in all of the greats. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains are our friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when the movement is from the Group of friends, very often, it never happens. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time arises in the city group, but is much less common to one city at a time was obtained from five to ten groups. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We&apos;re proud of it and we are proud that we can be part of a group from Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we play with some more. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were at the Festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We&apos;re lucky that&apos;s all our friends and we are proud that we can be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle, Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Also, it is very unusual that a group like yours to keep together, and even after all these years still the same members. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, the four of us we already 21 years and Matt (Cameron) is to join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is much longer than the usual duration of the group. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> I think that first of all we&apos;re all lucky that we&apos;re still in this world and, secondly, its role is the fact that we kept each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are close friends and we have managed to open the musical paths, which are each sufficient freedom to his own experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think it could be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the word glory was not simple. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grow, gradually getting easier to find the right balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We&apos;re trying to tour at all too, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> When you realize that the people came for the music, you must remind them that the music and what you gave her, respect. You may not get carried away by the celebrities, rock stars. This is not one of us ever really cared about. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember the next project of the Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> As a band we have existed for three years and we never had released any album, after he died, Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important is that, even today, been friends for with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us. When you listen to a song, or a look at the photos, I remember Andy as he was incredible, as I having with him. It&apos;s always a pleasure to work with him, laughing, talking about music or about football and many others. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an incredible person and is missing. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> National band Las Robertas will be responsible for that in Costa Rica started the show. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that therefore you have selected them as the bands? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production of the video sent to us with several proposals, and this group, we enjoyed the most. Therefore, we&apos;re wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very funny. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why always live changing words Yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That&apos;s the question on Eda (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings and I think adds the first what comes to mind. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Who you as a bass singer affects? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A lot of people. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> As the first I can think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, c. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There&apos;s so many that I could talk all night about the basistech who I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How did Pearl Jam hold the grunge, although no longer in vogue? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we always felt slightly separate from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When grunge music, I&apos;ll introduce you the group that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all other which arose at the same time. And if it is, even today, this music is valid, so it is something great, because it is music worth listening to, and groups such as Mudhoney today better music than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning of your music slightly gloomy character and now is more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is behind this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> That&apos;s interesting, because I have a feeling that, in the new album has a few songs that are lighter-style, but also there are songs like The End or Juste, Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although it may sound like a positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> In both of the two, is Ed, so I cried, and the songs are deeply dark. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when you grow up and you&apos;re in the life of a trauma, you lose a family member or friend, these things will influence your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I think you can be a happy person, and i still do a gloomy music. </seg>

<seg id="2170"> Twelve people yesterday at noon, voluntarily left the building, which illegally occupied and organized a giant party that delivered the neighbors. The building left from the regulation of the Court and without having to interfere with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> After the end of the operation was the replacement of the lock on the door, to prevent a recurrence of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From this moment on, the entry will be watching,&quot; said the administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Invaders, who took 11 of 13 apartments in the building-the rest are inhabited-took all electrical and water installations, in addition, been spray-painted walls and left garbage after all the species, in particular the cans for alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In the first three bytes were held a huge party that lasted two days and drove the other tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press, that after a period of time, when the building was occupied, sales decreased by 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque, stresses that the occupiers of the building had unfair competition, because selling drinks for 3 euro, whereas at the disco are worth 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the application, the neighbors because of the noise. But the problems of nezpůsobovali visitors discos, but those used by the House, and in particular those who participated here organised by the parties, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks has increased, according to the excited inhabitants of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The owner of the discotheque explained that problems were so great that he even agreed with the owner of the building, and is already nine months she forgives the rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> City police has also confirmed that, during the last few weeks has received more complaints from neighbors to a given situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The President of the urban group of the people&apos;s Party PP at the Town Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week requested that &quot;the building was immediately vystěhována and do away with the problems of civil coexistence, which suffers from the neighbors, and with the destruction of the area&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The President on Monday explained that before summer was to allocate only one floor, but in recent months, they get to all floors of the building, and almost all of the apartments and in one of them was even to steal. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this regard, he added that &quot;it should be put an end to impunity and to be consistent, if it acts against civil liability, which has occurred in the building&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday, the city police also out your building in Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> In 15 hours 30 minutes the police got into the building 35 in the street of Mont-ral, after what it called neighbors, who saw to the building of four people. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> All four were immediately detained. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> The Park or the mountains? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects met on the occasion of opening a procedure, which entails more than the controversy regarding the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Urban tender for 16 Gates once again opened the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid-1980s. years at the time of the greatest flowering of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this authority to print several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Leaflet has defined mountain as a large park Metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What&apos;s more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Then, in 1987, the lapse, CMB, park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not set on the axis North-South, but up (mountain)-down (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Collseroly qualification as a natural park, it is in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Reference has already been Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Such was the position until September, when the Town Hall announced the mega competition, consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of gateways to the Collseroly. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Gateway, of course, begs the more the idea of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either this, or someone trying to put a gate on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The only question is, therefore: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational, as well as on the basis of reflection on the town, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona&apos;s architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It&apos;s already a topic as clich? d, such as when two members of this old caste of the chosen meeting in an elevator shall hand. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this action is one of the rare matches between what he thinks three předstoupivší barcelonští architects and university professors. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection procedure has its merit. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> According to Roldána, after had originally question side of the Bay, &quot;it should be&quot; discuss on the &quot;mountain side&quot;, so speech Ildefonse Cerda Green apples not got dragged to the end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;We have to be based on the principle that most Barcelona Park is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Inter alia, his great availability. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for which the name&quot; gateway to Collserola &quot;carries&quot; lexikologickou trap &quot;: we have is to represent&quot; as inputs to the Park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world urbanism qualifies the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; allowing &quot;some risk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The danger of &quot;uncertainty, which is a project of a public place&quot; after the experience of the 1980s. years, which was in the area of Forum &quot;my swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is the very definition of borders, which should be built upon. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Do Something to define the means already the next step&quot;, that is, in principle, to move a step further. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;It should be borne in mind, the new urban and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General metropolitan plan (PGM)) may cause a a real disaster&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> If we look in more detail the question of Modol believes that the Valley slope Collserola can be &quot;considered a park&quot;, but the Barcelona of not, and for reasons that are purely topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol also reminded that there is already work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;may not end up on the rubbish,&quot; Although welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its context, that the project reaches from the &quot;first time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And, moreover, means that the proximity of the mountains and the town is a kind of pass, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be this technical profile, which will lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;it&apos;s all about skill&quot;, he says) that need to be created: &quot;Architects should be only the Tools&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game, is a complex, because the supporting documents for the tendering procedure is missing a global vision of the Collserola: &quot;was published 16 competitions, which deal with all of the axis of the mountains-the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be the area watched and recognized it as a whole&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has meant that at least he volunteered to all 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the project of one gate can be hindered on the concept and definition of architect neighboring gateways. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, the City Hall to ensure that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone facilities, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino Jonási forgave Larrazábalovi, which will be released </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days of imprisonment, the statutory agent Cadino Red pardoned his brother of the Mayor of Monterrey in the process, in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Jonás Manuel Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released, after the statutory agent of the Casino Red pardoned before the second Criminal Court of first instance in the precinct, which has discussed the case of blackmail, in which he accused the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, has published a series of photographs and videos, on which he was Manuel Jonás after demand pay economic quotas to City Hall in Monterrey allow illegal gambling operation in the House. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> After the public prosecution, the Prosecutor, the State has initiated criminal proceedings against the brother of the Mayor of panistického. 2. September was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Then after 4 hours spent before the Agent of the Public Ministry of the number 3 for property offences was rushed to the prison, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the capital city of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> He remained at this location for the following 49 days after it was decided the second regulation of the imprisonment and the agent of the Public Ministry to remove the possibility of participation or organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19. October was transferred to the Criminal Court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmail the owners of Casinos in Red by the amount of one and a half million peso. However, he stayed only a few hours in the prison with medium-heavy supervision because he was threatened by death. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The leaders have enabled him to stay in during the process of urban cells in San Nicolás de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> on October 25, was submitted to arrest, issued by the Secretary of the second criminal court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation was collected enough evidence to prove the guilt of the Jonásovu. Among the evidence such as the payment of the amount of 1.5 million peso representatives of casinos in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the statutory agent&apos;s Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to judge José Luis Pecinovi and asked for mercy for the brother of the Mayor of the region. On this basis, will be able to soon return to freedom. </seg>

<seg id="2236"> Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome introduced the details of air accident in which the Secretary of the Governor, Francisco died, Blake, and seven other persons. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat of communications and transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the Secretary of the Government died Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force without the pilot had the chance to try the forced landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At the press conference Jácome Dionisio Pérez, Secretary for communication and transport, said that before the start of the aircraft, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions of the years. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The parts that appear to suggest that the unit several times came into contact with the terrain, the wings caught up into the branches of the trees 25 feet from where the unit has lost hull&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Also informed that the drive was intended for 19 persons, therefore meets all the requirements for the movement of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, stated that on the basis of investigations carried out in the area of impact, not on the ground, find any parts. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;When searching, it was found that parts of the aircraft are not in another place, the plane then crashed on the Mainland as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, meets all the requirements for the transport of persons. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The terrain has a slope with a seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> The Secretary is satisfied that at the moment is the most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact with the helicopter of the Presidential General staff was a cruise speed and the accident took place on the soft ascending the field. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information supports the hypothesis that, in the time of the accident it was a normal crossing operation, &apos;&apos; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome enumerated the six fundamental points of investigations: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual Flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the aeronautical standards was implemented according to the rules of visual flight, this means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Reporting in the AICM indicate adequate conditions during takeoff, in accordance with the plane is moving towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico show the cloud layer at low altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> The chosen route: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that, because of the cloud, the crew were looking for lower area and greater visibility to the Valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> The location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar is the same, it is likely that before the crash lost control or disruption of the trajectory of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of aircraft on a limited territory: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information we have currently available, allows us to assume that was to impact on a straight track, and from the side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> A sketch of the dissipation of the aircraft indicates that at the time of impact, the Mainland was the helicopter intact. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Fire or explosion had been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> On the scene were not recorded any evidence indicating that an explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Final results of the investigation show that could cause multiple contacts with the Mainland. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work were found the remains of the aircraft at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, above the inclination of from seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the footage, in which there may be a breakdown along the route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information elements, which seems to indicate that the helicopter could get in contact with the ground at several points. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in the territory, which is larger than the territory of the establishment, the remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the idea that the impact occurred in the State, when the helicopter is still intact. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> Mexican Institute of health insurance has started research on a gene that causes obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Institute of health insurance leads research in order to discover the gene responsible for the obesity children and teenagers. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that leads research in order to detect the gene for obesity in children and young people. Research entitled &quot;Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents&quot; allows to obtain the results relating to overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In the report, the head of Research of the medical unit in the field of biochemistry of the National Medical Center Hospital specialized in 21. century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that was established a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, experts in nutrition, and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils, post-graduate studies from the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Centre for research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the national polytechnického Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Engage in research may also the general public, having or not having the permissions. People may come into participating in the sports centres of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where they each Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests of adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He emphasized that the research he began in the sports centre of the Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and 8. October, this activity is carried out also in the Sports Centre Nezahualcóyolt (East of the Mexican State). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once they obtained the data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Centre Independencia (South of the Federal District), and finally in the sports centre of Morelos (North of the Federal Centre). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the elements and importance of genetics, regards the development of obesity, and track down the Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the international day of the diabetes, which is celebrated on 14. November, he reminded that the aim is to collect the data from the three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires about nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The questionnaire will ask also for physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases with the aim of avoiding risk factors which might cause diseases such as diabetes or renal inadequacy. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Clarified that every Saturday with all participants carry out antropometrická measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), measure the blood pressure, determines the level of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and to examine the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the formation of childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López stated that this study reflects concern over the growth of Medic alarmujícím children&apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos; Health Survey undertaken between 1999 and 2006 have shown that in just six years only for boys, to an increase in obesity by 77% and for girls of 47%. The dramatic increase took place also in the case of overweight &apos;, said the expert of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Stated that one of the reasons the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from other populations of their genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Reported that the average Mexican&apos;s 65% of the indiánsko-American genetic predispositions, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in General, genetics of obesity is commonly explained as inability to burn excess energy, which konzumujeme (calories), and which is stored in the form of fats. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The scientist explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive in the overall assessment of the situation of children, which finds that show any known of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> He said that even the presence of wrinkles dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual will suffer through problems and předcukrovkovými States. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is confidential, it shall be transmitted in writing to the parents, doctors and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must be carried out so that their children can avoid illness. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sedentary way of life, indicating the lack of daily physical activity, all day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Overweight causes also a large intake of food, that is, the greater the consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (bread, tamales, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic burden which is the subject of this research. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In the Asphalt from the UNAM are bumps </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemical Faculty of the UNAM creates Renault with polymers and creating a combination of having a better functionality, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If properly handled on the Cobbles, it would not be correct to almost 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the metropolitan area, the Valle de México, said Rafael Nájera Herrera, a scientist from the chemical faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture, the Technological cause potholes said in the framework of the international year of Chemistry Laboratory, announced that under his leadership, develops Renault with polymers, which should emerge from a mixture of having similar characteristics as the asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera is of the opinion that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some cities in the North of the country. Improve the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are known as malteny. Together supplying asphalt typical viskoelastický character. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viskoelastický the character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a fluid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while at low temperature asphalt has tendency to worry, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but it varies during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> A scientist from the chemical Faculty of the observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México it is covered with a flexible tile, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the layers of the nejsvrchnějšími is the tar file, consisting of small stones drenched in asphalt and then compressed. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> He emphasized that every stone, which forms the Insert, it is through the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Passing cars or when creating the pressure it is possible to force the pavement right up. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it was modified asphalt, decompose would be even better, believes a chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> He added that on the asphalt pad is placed on the last layer called the cloak, consisting of fine sand, stones, also filled in the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Whereas, this layer will be coming into contact with the rims of vehicles, must have greater mechanical strength than the tar file and must ensure that the friction of the road. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Whereas, as part of the pavement will be exposed to large loads, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness, and care must be taken to the material from which it is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, they are also a very important factor that you should keep in mind. In particular, the water has a large influence on the functionality of the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As soon as the ground is wet, water travels inside and it is hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of pavement and the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Explained that during the creation of potholes in the film as the first coat and then leads to damage to the asphalt. Damage but does not occur in a single moment, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs of using appropriate maintenance programmes. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the tile must match the load of vehicles and must guarantee that this burden shall not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that as regards the asphalt, still waiting for us a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsion, which are in other countries, are already available on the market and enable you to easily fix the bumps without the use of high temperature. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was missing from the top of Valle, to become the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of factors that have contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna has not received the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle so gaining 14. the title of the first vícemiss. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca has once again regained the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that ended up on the podium of Wimbledon, won the silver Crown and sash, on the basis of which become the new first vícemiss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> On the basis of the results of the previous finals in Cartagena, which won and the sceptre took Miss Atlántico, the Department gained 14. the title of the first vícemiss. Melina has joined the masses of women from Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of victory Crest, but eventually was declared the first vícemiss. They include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The question many are asking. What is missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The result is the defeat of the great Sultana, which in all previous rounds has shown that he is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain, became Queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> One of the key factors that decided that the jury has decided to appoint her, only the first vícemiss, is the fact that I didn&apos;t answer his question: &quot;which book you liked the most, and why?&quot;, which put the Martín Murillo Gómez from literary editors Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> To the question, she replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot. Very I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. The book, which influenced me most in childhood, &quot;the little Prince&quot;, a very deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently I&apos;m reading &quot;crime and punishment&quot;. It&apos;s a book that is part of the worldwide literature, which we should all know. And today I&apos;ve got a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. This is a beautiful book with the name &quot;El ardor de la sangre&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response, like the term &quot;culturize,&quot; and, secondly, because she did not explain her individual mentioned the book marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> After the awards ceremony Melina declared that it is easy, and my joy from the result: &quot;the world is wise, what has to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And you people read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Bogotský journalist, suggested that that candidate was from the beginning of his favorite, and the one who took all the previous price (Gastronomic challenge or Ostyor, title to the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo Queen, who then failed once on stage. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and his Prime Minister, the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel took place on Monday, 14. November in Leipzig for the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU). </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The question of the future of Europe on the program originally was not, but her in the autumn, in particular, that they were satisfied by the party members, who consider the policy of the Government to the Greeks today and maybe tomorrow against the Italians at lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission brought the leadership was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Only nine of the number 1001 delegates was against and 10 delegates abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Although standing ovation at the conclusion of performance of Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro-European Finance Minister, did not leave room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only that, Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> According to Chancellor in Europe, &quot;it is time for change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the Member countries of the euro area, but also it could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, &quot;in order to give Europe a face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is in any case one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly, Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom, and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same approach shall deliver also, Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the direction is vytýčen. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> As delegates rejected by a large majority a proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Guided by the concern to calm the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. Try to get Congress to talk about &quot;small&quot; European States or States which are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the proposal concerning Europe devotes one paragraph of the importance &quot;of Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel, France never quoted. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Only indirectly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> When reminded that two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most pokořujících defeats the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What constitutes fraud in incapacity? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After aid run party UMP and the Government offensive against the working neschopnostem. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15. December in Bordeaux and visit the Office for granting social aid, where it delivers a speech on the theme of recurring from 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> As the escorts of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased stringency, but is no less clear from the perspective of right-wing of the presidential campaign, he wants to focus on right-wing majority of incapacity. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, because of budgetary savings, the Government intends to impose upon employees of the private sector on the fourth day of the incapacity before they start taking aid in sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick, lost four days wages, at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> The measures, which risks cause many bad blood, but which, according to the worksheet, Les Echos can bring 280 million euro. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And also measures, which should be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: give civil servants a day unpaid incapacity (so far, they have no failure compared to three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these questions are the subject of the discussion, the right-wing majority runs also the theme of fraud aimed this time at abuses tied to labour neschopnostmi. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Checks will be much larger and in addition: If you are caught, you will be coming back,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand in the interview provided by the station RTL Sunday 13. November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth about the misdeeds of the working neschopnostech. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> These were in fact subject to the standing monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught which brought its fruits. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Consider the first of several official numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the Caisse nationale d&apos;assurance maladie (CNAM-State health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euros per diem refunds. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute for research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008 the daily compensation allowance to their 11.3 billion euro, 5% of the expenditure in the health sector. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, with 46% of the involved parent contributions and work accidents and 54% of the covered the working inability of, i.e.. 6.2 billion euro. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Therefore only 2.5% of the cost of health care. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> According to a study group Alma Consulting were the French in 2010, an average of 14,5 days of incapacity, compared with 17.8 days in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Average, which carries certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 on the pages dealing with jobs Monster.com has shown that 75% of the 40,000 French employees of the respondents replied that all lessened by no day of the incapacity. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time by the sickness insurance institutions, States that, in 2010 37,8% working inability was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, French staff are not more than elsewhere, prone to work neschopnostem. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Cheating in neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As regards fraud, these are just small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Strengthening of legislation from 2002, there are systematic checks on the incapacity of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, the CNAM stated that when the 1.5 million checks were 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to short-neschopnostem &quot;of irregular or too long&quot;, i.e.. 37 050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of systematically controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with 22, 11% of the cases, &quot;nepřizpůsobených&quot; or &quot;irregular&quot; to 1.2 million checks, i.e.. 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A total of 169 000 &quot;irregular&quot; cases to the several million workers who were sick. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A number that represents much less than the figure expressing the work on black. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the members of the UMP, the author Dominique Tiana June report on this issue, this number would be a 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i.e.. more than the total amount of the daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than fraud associated with the last mentioned. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts must prevail over the dogmaty </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or emotions, then it&apos;s energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is natural that the meeting when the election was an opportunity for thinking of such deposits and on-the-spot, which takes energy from the core. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful only when exploring all the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base its position on the objective facts and rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> So far, on the planet of 7 billion human beings, but the demographic development occurs from now on, by 2050 the duplication of electricity demand, if we want to get rid of a considerable part of the world&apos;s population are important components of life. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time will need to face the lack of fossil resources, in order to continue to produce electricity, and not to forget the essential need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, which is the subject of, which currently goes for environmental debates. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> An accident in Fukušimě has no effect on any of the following parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> And that is why Germany is alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> That is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision necessary to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considered the right to build only the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, after the Fukušimě decided to expand its park one unit restoring the construction of one power broken after the crash power plants Three Mile Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model based on renewable energies are sometimes presented as an example of a reality that is contrary to. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will affect the high electricity prices, increased energy dependency on gas imported from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All these effects have already during several months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark deserves to be above it appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> The European champion in wind power plants, of which removes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which are CO2 emissions and higher price of Danish electricity by 65% and 50%, than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in the globalized economy, energy costs represent a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, French businesses to enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would produce a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make iluzorními a beautiful Declaration of renewed industrialization of our country and the preservation of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The price that the great majority of French people refusing to pay, as well as are fundamentally committed to this energy, as the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Noted that the energy policy of our country has allowed the industry to build 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 downstream jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> A strong export sector for them to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialized firms producing jobs that cannot be transferred abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France has decided to leave the core, sacrifice would be a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, and she&apos;d come by 6 billion euros per year, which gets on export of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Who is the owner of the power plant would have ordered nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while he was scheduled to decline its producer? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In addressing the energy equation is necessary to admit that there is no magic source of energy production, and that there is no evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Development of establishments producing low emissions of CO2, nuclear facilities and installations using renewable energy sources by the French Industrial Group AREVA is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have the State Office for nuclear safety, which carries out rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power stations as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, they have the idea of safety in the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In fifty years, the nuclear industry recognized three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one in Three Mile Iceland happened in conditions of normal operation and remained without a human sacrifice, and the consequences for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> Chernobyl reactor caused the drama concept and unjustifiable human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In the case of Fukušimy, it seems that some people forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters unprecedented scale, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Nuclear industry to take lessons from this accident, just as it did for the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Fruit of this step and cooperation between French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the reactor type EPR is a concept able to resist such a phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant, to him as, cessation of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the company Group AREVA and EDF and the release of the way to ensure that they took over the leading position in nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate search for the best solutions to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and machinations dominate debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation in our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Policy in the field of immigration carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles-congestion, the police, the courts and the administration under policy number, compatibility of this policy, the status of the country of human rights &quot;, in which France boast. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, it was the administrative harassment to whose object were foreign students, which became the current when the Minister of the Interior (see sheet of Libération from 23 May) said that France &quot;does not need a foreign talent, Masons and the waitress&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it has been rarely rozebírána angle of economy. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Must be said that in this area, the fairly wide agreement between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac, his statement that &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers&quot; and on the left, Michel Rocard, when, in 1990, he said that France &quot;cannot accept all the misery of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005 he was the fear of invasion hordes of Polish plumbers on the French territory is shared to the right and to the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden for the economy and the French company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of generosity, uráčíme immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande limited to banalities, indicates that the joint development will allow you to solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem is maybe in the elections, economically, but is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> How do economists like Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 str.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries which immigrants accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Reducing immigration paralyzes growth and bad for employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Concerns about the effects of the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace the French workers, especially those less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than adding replacements for French workers, by carrying out work in sectors with the lack of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that don&apos;t attract the French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is not enough places menu. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as the surgeon will have a problem with the work in the country where the lack of anesteziologů, this tween between the Frenchman and migrants make the additions of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of the French employees. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri so reckons that the growth of migratory movements of 1% will cause the long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of the přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among us holders of the Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also in the European countries, net contributors to social systems amounting to 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The world labour organisation e.g. It is estimated that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring in all my life to public budgets of net contribution (revenue minus expenses) 150000 euro. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate, the desire to collect for a missing percent growth &quot;with bared teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, democracy remains to be explored by the European </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious and fragile goods. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent would you should remember, however, that in Athens, two thousand years ago, has seen in the course of the XX. the century of the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some people believe that to ensure that democracy finally triumphed over their adversaries, will be enough to make the choice and implement it in the most direct manner. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> He knows, however, from Napoleon, was an ease of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, while it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may become a &quot;tool of oppression&quot; as once said Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organisation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis of Europe, which we are experiencing, is a crisis of economic, but is just since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Return errors of Greek referendum in a Yes-or-no in this direction will have the value of double exposure: detection of the need for a large return of political power, but also reveal alarming sense of his inability to, its inappropriateness. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be promýšlena so that it can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front line of the democratic struggle now to shuffle, and that many of the Republican fighters already back in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, if we require a series of national referenda held pursuant to the need and in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Blank drawn European an monarch or jump with tied legs into the void of nationalistic depths: what kind of selection for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we don&apos;t want the knives of the guillotine, but common, a full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Not the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal-or indeed, we didn&apos;t know where the list of stop-since the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe looming before the diktat of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers for their inability to and their lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe, which is reduced in the international arena. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Zneklidňujeme when sovereignty to Europe-but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and each of its Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Urgently need to return control of the European project of democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> As the only Europeans will be able to reduce the responsibility of their debt, get rid of government markets and investing to prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Exit from the crisis will assume the decision at European level, which will not be able to be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, would have led to the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After what we have long fought against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, now we strongly request European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So Be It. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be the new craziness and new dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We have to take on a new stage in European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To create a Republic in France, it was necessary &quot;to be,&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Revolution in interests to under-estimate. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson shall continue to apply. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> It will be able to carry out building a Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Staňme with the Europeans, to build Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;Non-contact&quot; smart card spreads </seg>

<seg id="2798"> Long-term suspicion that there are bundles of terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the sector of Niger _boko Haram are confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Algerian Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria about from now on, &quot;he assured&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which both organizations are operating, and intelligence reports show that there is a great synergy between them,&quot; explained without further clarification. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> It seems that Paris has a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Investigation of the abduction of the two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illumine the passageways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> After they were abducted by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, should all be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory following day killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces. </seg>

<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis carried out by the call leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to the station, Radio France Internationale (RFI) interested investigators especially two numbers: one leads to the Nigerians, who long resided in Maiduguri, a city in the North of Nigeria, which is the cradle of _boko Haram, and second to the man, which he says is close to AQMI and sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It&apos;s progress, but it should be without a doubt wait for more evidence before we start talking about the operational cooperation between the AQMI and _boko Haram&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We know already for years, that the sect enjoy external financial and intellectual support and that is reflected in the increasingly more actively,&quot; the gentle statements Nigerian counsel Kunle Amuwo. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months this &quot;aid&quot; is more and more obvious in the development and expression of _boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims, or still more complex explosive devices the same way of implementation, such as the equipment used by AQMI. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community on the forehead with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria to take into consideration the issues raised by the _boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Nigerian authorities, in fact, long considered a group of the community of enlightened Mystics little worthy of interest. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, a new input port of the Russian gas to Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> -Remote Nord Stream napojující directly to the Eastern Europe to Russia and held for the bottom of the Baltic Sea started to work. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> Must provide gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant, he wanted this event to celebrate properly. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of State and Government, last Tuesday attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline, which under the sea connects directly to Russia and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together control around the valve management entry of Russian gas into the Western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> This new pipeline begins to flow each year into Western Europe additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas the first pipe of a length of 1 224 km connecting St Petersburg region is the land of Mecklembursko-Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity that is equal to the whole of the French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And no longer resembles the option to build a third pipe pipeline on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom has the timely completion of this huge construction character of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project is strongly protesting against Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany without it, that would be conducted on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> At the same time these two countries are losing a bit of power: the ability to push Russia to threats that his close access to Western European markets, it becomes more difficult for them. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> The most it Warsaw, when she likened to Nord Stream to &quot;new German-Soviet Pact&quot;, referring to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> It means to say that it is a politically sensitive topic. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe with its support for this project in the Russian won the greater certainty of their purchases. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is at the cost of weakening Europe energy, because the project has created a rift among Europeans from the East and the West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia managed to barely 5 years ago to promote its vision of direct Alliance between Russia and the rich Western States with high consumption of gas, the bearings are coming to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, new Street, which connects us organically,&quot; said François Fillon at the solemn opening of the pipeline and has demonstrated the extent to which point are large natural gas contracts things as political and economic power. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, place of supply of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical offence. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> Underwater pipeline is of steel bearing the mantle of concrete to be protected from anchors seagoing vessels. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> When its construction was necessary to avoid minovým fields originating from the period of 2. during World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Because of the security they have had to be nearly a hundred of them deleted or destroyed&quot;, says Jens Müller, a spokesman of the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Need too build up measures for the protection of fauna and flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelovek, which on its entire length is nowhere interrupted nor valves and stations maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> One control platform should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but it was rejected by the project manager when the Swedes were just a few greedy to see the Russian State-owned company as permanent implants on their coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the case of failure to stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute&quot;, explains Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the case of a leak in the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered the likely little builders, it welds was designed so that a leak was created once per 100 000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Check the condition of the pipeline from the outside by an underwater robot-driven ships, while the Interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This device is shaped with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the pipe and is firmly held gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> In destination throughout the three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on the potential deformations of the metal components. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> Long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest correction. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Gas circuit is simply to ensure the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar destination. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> For the realisation of this project, five companies joined forces. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Leadership remains to Gazprom, which holds a market share of 51%. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> It is joined by the German company e.on and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream is responsible for the construction and operation of a gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The company has its registered office in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then this company has leased for five years, which may be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will have a profit of the entire capacity, the quantity of gas to any real,&quot; explains Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Finance the construction of ensure of the 30% of the shareholders and 70% of bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work should reach a 7,4 billion euro for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For group GDF Suez so investment costs have risen to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs of returns, because the risk takes only Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Gas pipeline from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to sand with the pine forests. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valves high 4,5 metres form the output gate gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> The sensor measures the pressure, temperature, and other characteristics of the incoming gas, before it is transported to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this Terminal receives every hour one million cubic meters of Russian gas. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Upon reaching full capacity will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million. </seg>

<seg id="2926"> The image belongs to Moleskine notebook that its owners are cosmopolitan, sophisticated and open-minded spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> A small Italian company, which in its early days had 12 employees, is today almost a hundred and from 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> His notebooks distributed to bookshops and through the chain of stores, FNAC in small boutiques in the centers of cities, where he was to assert their identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the spirit of the period and this need for new writing, despite the turbulent development of the e-mails &apos;, explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, Mark opened the exhibition &quot;my way&quot;, where architects or artists display their notebook. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why is it so high share of unemployed hendikepovaných workers? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Around 19% of the hendikepovaných people looking for work. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today opens a 15. Week for the employment of hendikepovaných. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Via the voluntaristickou public policy established in 2005 the percentage of unemployed persons hendikepovaných twice higher than the average, i.e.. 19% compared with 9% for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It&apos;s depressing? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, which organizes the week for the employment of hendikepovaných.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;Progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the percentage of the unemployed was not twice, but three times.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, it remains still much to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It should be noted that for the unemployed handicapped persons there are numerous obstacles before their arrival to work. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> This is an older persons: 37% has more than 50 years ago (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated high school and from 2,3 million students of universities is only 10 000 hendikepovaných. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And finally-the long-term unemployment is very high: 53% in hendikepovaných compared to 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, those are the criteria which especially complicated by the return to work and which constitute the &quot;core problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapina, General Director of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses to receive handicapped workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> As regards the objective of the brake. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Leaves neřečené, ways of thinking, which of course evolve, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study carried out in April by IMS Entreprendre pour la Cité found that respondents managers have a &quot;low level of knowledge about hendikepovaných persons&quot; with the &quot;exaggerated notion of the persons on the gauze and psychological or mental deficiencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from that in order to achieve the objectives of the employing 6% hendikepovaných of workers laid down in the law of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> Last known numbers that originate from 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now we are around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Organization of the Agefiph, in charge of collecting fees from businesses that fail to comply with this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof is the number of &quot;pokutovaných&quot; of enterprises, as well as amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit on 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, especially in large enterprises.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of labour only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employs handicapped workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Gambling: &quot;lucky&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2961"> Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Auditorium, the Stade de France, in short, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after his attacker to read gesture in the match against Turkey was a Belgian coach to his players only words of praise. </seg>

<seg id="2976"> As Leekens said i &quot;pride&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; win &quot;the game-holiday&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2985"> Portugal coach Paulo Bento launches with great optimism play-offs against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> On the way there both teams lacked realism. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of the 90 minutes we&apos;ll happy team and, above all, safe countries&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento had sees in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>

<seg id="2990"> Portugal divided by happiness in fact 90 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Left to play one game and one opponent-Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In Friday&apos;s result (0-0) in hell Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that there is nothing to tie the game. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal was more than an hour, but was not able to give a rare goal, which would relieve him. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;It&apos;s a good result, however, contains a risk because we&apos;re outside they góla.&quot; </seg>
