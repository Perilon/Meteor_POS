<seg id="1"> Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the proposed cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the opposition leader. </seg>
<seg id="3"> MEPs rejected at second reading the proposed amendment to reduce sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former First Minister is currently imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tymosenko in October was sentenced to 7 years in prison for entering into an agreement with Russia priori disadvantageous for the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not final and the court must decide the appeal of the convicted in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymosenko describes the judgment of political revenge of the regime and led a process of suspected partiality of the court also to the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Cancel the proposed paragraph 365 of the criminal law, based on which the former Minister premere was sentenced, was signed by 147 MPs. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There have been 226 votes for approval. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> Liberation or rebellion Jamahiriya already defeated her. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It remains to determine the winners. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Interim National Council declared the usual Sharia law and we already know what it is. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya is a country without crime because for a flight is cut by hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women can forget emancipation, not respect any of the faith is punishable by death ... </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is the Quran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator society composed of opposing tribes. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Libya will rule such an order as we can not represent us and as we would certainly not do. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But the way we live is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is particularly surprising that the Islamist fighters have agreed to help with recognition of infidels dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only excuse is that this is not a general américian who led the NATO strikes but Allah which they celebrated the greatness in each attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So when it comes to look for winners in Libya, the West does not belong </seg>
<seg id="23"> We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitiques turned away from the dictator as an ally without this policy brings no profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is therefore no problem for locals to get rid of &amp;quot;crusaders&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Do not land, oil companies have easy access to black gold libyien. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Maybe not as much and the West will eventually boast a disinterested protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As long as we prevent these followers of the sharia. </seg>

<seg id="77"> Feeding an overweight child: do not take breakfast and not take cold cuts for dinner </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have weight problems, 9% of écoliersont weight above the average and 5% are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As shown in current research obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This shows again how important is the environment in which a human being and patterns that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children are for instance 50% of meat more often than in families of children at normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of obese had fries for dinner according to a survey conducted with advocacy &amp;quot;Obesity is not a chance&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In large families of small sport is also not a habit, what is now the case of most students today - only 15% responded at least once a week were the parents time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Investigation of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 primary school children in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &amp;quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&amp;quot;, action supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the beginning it was more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who enrolled in the project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children overweight or obese, is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &amp;quot;Only half the children surveyed said such as eating five times a day if breakfast - lunch - dinner snack, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition,&amp;quot; said one of the results of investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and dinner sausages </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts point to the fact that for a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Czech Republic, only 23% of students&amp;#39; families to eat my same hours. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families everyone has breakfast only. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst that has been identified is one tenth of the population does not at all breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is nevertheless the basis of a good daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children are consumed more often unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinking soft drinks daily (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> Over 40% of children surveyed regularly plays sport but for parents it&amp;#39;s half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Get ready your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the investigation led to the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) prepare its own food from opportunities offered by their own taste and personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &amp;quot;The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far, in terms of healthy eating, the ideal&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite dishes there are plenty of cakes, meats and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &amp;quot;Most alarming is a particularly strong preference for sweet lemonade,&amp;quot; is indicated in the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch it&amp;#39;s the pasta that took place just before the first white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Children do not want starch and the preference for fish meal and vegetables was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Cap on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &amp;quot;In a control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the educational session&amp;quot; Obesity is not a chance &amp;quot;, was present at the taking a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet, &amp;quot;indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most striking example was in respect of sugary soft drinks as children began to give preference to water consumption. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main course and sweet dishes and reduce the &amp;quot;dumplings&amp;quot; (spécialté Czech dumplings flour bread or potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer must also be a good psychologist, professionals say </seg>
<seg id="112"> In an introductory article on how to learn for designers, I started a little bit angry because there were many from the start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I was not thinking about what would happen next. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Presentations from three professional specialty, clothing and characters of a seminar on what happens there. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer we get final exams and we expect practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it&amp;#39;s truly &amp;quot;drunk&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the Director Alenka (over there is no boy) addressed how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has a small neck, the other a boy&amp;#39;s body, without particular curve, another overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend or add a neck curves necessary. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrived pretty well to emphasize the character and also not to dress too flashy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with large breasts and hips and a pronounced waist. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is such a difference between the waist and hips so that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it&amp;#39;s worth it to have it done custom. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls neatly is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than the one that glides continuously, wraps and not due to the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a dress style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I&amp;#39;m glad I have all week to sort all the information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also fear that, given what I do at home is there too. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into consideration the current appearance, mode type of personality and appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will &amp;quot;dress&amp;quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know of the Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In my heart, I am pleased because it&amp;#39;s better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, which took almost one hundred pounds lately (do not take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We need to cut and sew from magazines or searching the Internet, print and graphic design work. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard, as they say in the final result, express our personal style and our relationship with graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Reflect also on the graphics portion of styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist did not dress so only the physical but creates productive eg pages in magazines (on specific products trends for handbags, coats, etc ...). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, has maintained all this. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But that ... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The stylist must have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three of the guests gave a specialty diversified aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka Renc and Ben, a fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub has reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one dress differently. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variability is important for this example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Such as the trench coat that must be worn with classic jeans and a t-shirt as a light jacket but it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take a picture as a dress . </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just holding sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &amp;quot;Play with this,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I especially appreciated the following advice: &amp;quot;To work you need to know the rules perfectly.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &amp;quot;You can then begin to infringe,&amp;quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines you sometimes see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on the catwalk. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the designer must be many more variations of clothing than those photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> This means that for fashion story to be about ten pages (thus ten models) I must be prepared to &amp;quot;shrink&amp;quot; at least a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with it during a model creation. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but his image and marketing have made a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Czech Republic, the approach to the use of services of stylists still chilly. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the familiar faces sometimes regard as useless (just something I know but what I seem to pass in the second row). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone gets a styling make our part, we must then rely on the fact that he tells us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than it actually has. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It remains then only surf google and check if the details show boulevard of the celebrity in question, if she lost weight and grown so ... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough to move into designer fashion and how to assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> It must communicate with people he dresses well and is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Guess people know, not to flatter, keep his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &amp;quot;When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new items you can not throw everything away and say, My God, how awful.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &amp;quot;There are few things that you find attractive and that you will advise him what to wear them with,&amp;quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> This showed us concretely what must all contain the so-called &amp;quot;placovka&amp;quot; or sack the stylist. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is the one you hang around the waist and so on you for everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to clear things such as scissors, rollers for hair removal or even safety pins, there are also nylon thread (the stylist uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), clips special with a garment which is closed in the back, if too large (the pin or other type of clip are not utlisables because they may damage the garment) or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For that we be not only people who listen but have tried something practical way they taught us how to properly ressemeller shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the base could damage, let alone outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we stuck and glued. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We were not allowed to touch the scissors to avoid injury by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Therefore real skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario I was pleased when he congratulated me for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The comptence which I discuss is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend courses </seg>
<seg id="178"> I began increasingly to understand that make styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone may say what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Need for Speed ​​The Run is played all over America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Revision </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without problem becomes because of a series of stupid mistakes of people who do not belong in a routine morning shift at work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it is useless if no one wants to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new game, subtitled The Run has produced high expectations before its release. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed ​​already old and out like a game playable from parts that do not just count points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were curious how the passages will be added in which the hero leaves his car and does what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what we atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> These are potentially racing games arcades all but pulls down because of some unnecessary fouls that already exist for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> These are not really errors but rather an expression of the incomprehensible laziness from developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught in an adventure whose hero Jack has behavior problems and to resolve begins to participate in illegal races across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to finish first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten steps and then over 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race is on a different route and stages set in different environments that stand well enough from each other and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player did not feel a moment that the game itself offers something similar. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are further quite nice although the level graphical technique is the same type as the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally it is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert landscape in autumn or in the snowy mountains is very highly visually pleasing. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are in addition to occasionally embellished with an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you greatly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Beside that the different races are arranged one behind the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There &amp;#39;are only a small number but it was enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are moments you strive to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then you still waiting for another duel with an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Occasionally you also have police coming into the game and trying to get the dificult situation. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The new crossings are outside the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you must help by pressing the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is that there are fewer moments like this that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> The result is as good as this component will not interfere and is placed in the context described above, in the elements dress up game </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of action is in the tradition of previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that currently there is nothing fancy but you can not say that it is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> With regard to the realistic simulation you will go elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But although we can find better in conccurrence leadership style goes very well with the type design racing. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So everything is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems start to appear after some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> At the diffference Model of Conduct, that collision is not yet ready. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We do not expect this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not, in a collision with any object, any idea of ​​how your car behaves, in proceedings is not completely correct. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During the tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other but slightly different from your self in crazy acrobatics. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or is found to smithereens. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to restart this is not really a problem but it really bothers you. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The restart is done so that when you&amp;#39;re broke or you figure out the game in the set you back at the last point on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you do just that 5 restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it&amp;#39;s more a tool, in case something does not happen as it should, that something that you can truly count on. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes reboots do not help and we must find the solution to the piece of memory remémorrant route in question. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The great catch of this game is that the same actions can be found in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example there are some corners that we should move a certain way if it does not pass. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you encounter on a given location of vehicles &amp;quot;civilian&amp;quot; always in the same configuration as you reach the first, fifth, five seconds ahead or one minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What angers these are the situations when you see the opponent switch easily between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and conturner or slow. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Never mind if you go to meet him because it is &amp;quot;calculated&amp;quot; so that for the given situation always happens near your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents have other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the time of the game, but you have come in some places, again regardless of the time, and you still have the same opponent in front of you in one place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This causes the most problems in end-game as you travel on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must at all costs before you go. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it passes you it blocks the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide many times. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you&amp;#39;re bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it&amp;#39;s a shame because through a simple model of driving the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And no matter if it&amp;#39;s because the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of races is such that n &amp;#39;there is no chance of getting bored or something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change in car races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must be careful at petrol stations on the routes because you can change cars, however most of the time that you simply. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Sports cars are ideal for cities, big cars to U.S. highways straight and super sports cars with exotic finery on very technical lines such as on winding roads in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of the adventure, goes very well with the primary plan of history. </seg>

<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not great, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What bothers is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not level and in some cases tragically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging does not serve you any more. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio portion is good and the track is the choice. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to please the greatest number and most especially to young audiences a new soundtrack was created in the style &amp;quot;I mix everything&amp;quot;, but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music . </seg>

<seg id="278"> &amp;quot;The Lisbon Treaty has fundamentally eliminated the balance between institutions&amp;#39; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &amp;quot;I do not expect a war so hard.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="283"> &amp;quot;From the beginning echoed the criticism he is bland, it&amp;#39;s a pencil pusher, he can no rempplir mission and I must say it was breathtaking to everyone because it takes his role to perfection. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s a good listener 27 member states, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where to go to Europe.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="293"> There must also approve the new budget septimal Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation. </seg>

<seg id="305"> According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future are new tough rules on fiscal policy that await members. </seg>

<seg id="312"> History of a brand: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone were to get the word that expresses the closer the IBM, the closest would be &amp;quot;long term&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is seen as a firm and yet very current since its inception it took one hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Based on this long-term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He left this slogan that many global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Her motto, &amp;quot;THINK,&amp;quot; became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of IBM internal magazine that began to publish in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was the basis of corporate culture soignement developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> IBM means for us a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived one hundred years due to the fact that she always remained true to its core values ​​and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around her. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us during our first century of transforming technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will reach even more &amp;quot;for the anniversary has délaré the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A well-prepared </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only American among the first employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer a more uniform employee an elegant and well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Similarly IBM has a sytème of customer relations well developed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was early in the discovery of great talents-as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could well have a choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory, since it will be a woman-Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> This works for IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brainstorming online from what comes from many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> This is the internal and external image of the company that provide a safe position in the fields of business. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &amp;quot;Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than an institution of technology firm,&amp;quot; said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &amp;quot;IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve problems in the world of business by using its technology,&amp;quot; added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As stated by the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &amp;quot;Big Blue&amp;quot;, as it is familiarly called in the U.S. with regard to its slogan, in a hundred years it has grown into one of the largest global companies. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, housing, services at the Council&amp;#39;s server products, to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It has many patents of all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his discoveries ranks such as ATM, card payment, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM found itself this year with $ 220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all fabrications and innovations that have taken customer preference and the time - for example, IBM has not met the challenge of a clean operating system OS / 2, the Prodigy online service or the &amp;#39;IBM PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &amp;quot;From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you can not remain emotionally attached to the past,&amp;quot; notes Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Why IBM has no problem to build bases on many platforms and when they do not work she goes. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike the example of Microsoft conccurent that stands at the base and remains under the operational system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> IBM in revenue, services, who are trained to fifth by the software and hardware, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However even in 1990 it was with more than one half the participation of the strongest representative hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Starting in 2000 IBM sold the low-yielding assets for $ 15 billion during grasp this period it has invested $ 58 billion in purchasing technology perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="351"> She goes on investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression has also increased its investment volume. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It now appears that IBM passes the current crisis without interference? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The share price has progessé IBM from 2008 rocket 120 percent, net income from the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the company IBM is to change everything but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Can be expected for this that this giant flexible mastery of other crises. </seg>

<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: It concerns you too? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to determine defects typical of women, all, some like the others, are able to get out &amp;quot;of their race.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear ladies, you&amp;#39;ll experience in the following lines of female vices coming to pump blood from the veins of men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half you commented that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> You must buy at least one garment per week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are happy to buy and packet during the sales? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case we can speak of purchases as a flaw. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you will say, which would resist window shopping in clothing stores, looking for himself in pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideally of different colors)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And although for most women buy either a hobby, it can become for man a living hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Just remember how many times have you told your spouse that he expects the entry ... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Continuing dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not too big&amp;quot;? </seg>
<seg id="418"> &amp;quot;I need to lose weight under 5 pounds - I should start exercising?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &amp;quot;You like me?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These sentences do not they remind you something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Therefore you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> This is not the question you should stop looking after yourself but many people are allergic to the fact that their partner is always going to complain about its appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the higher the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become pesky. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The cleanliness cleanly in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It&amp;#39;s like a carousel infinity. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Washing windows, vacuuming, washing floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and that twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the floor clean, the children they have messed up the sink, dirty the glass in the living room, and this gives you a lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> In case you have precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness should not be in first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This desire for cleanliness harmless but can ruin your relationships and even family peace. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The undermining </seg>
<seg id="432"> &amp;quot;Met this tracksuit worn in the trash.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &amp;quot;You look to those old socks again tomorrow?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &amp;quot;A wet towel does not belong on the floor&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you make your partner this undermining in this way several times a day, you will really break it down. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Obviously you do not think badly you want everything to be perfect. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Maybe if men did, women would not do so much work to undermine ... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Defamation, mockery </seg>
<seg id="439"> Defamation, mockery but also insults against someone are also characteristic of some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women tend particularly to relationships and so are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps each of us let out a little harmless banter here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on heart yet it is a peculiarity of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those who advise, persiflent even despise others and for those around them are - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Voracek and Jagr helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory over Philadelphia Monday&amp;#39;s game on NHL ice Carolina and is again at the top of Czech players productive for the contest. </seg>
<seg id="446"> From the perspective of 39 years of star Claude Giroux, who still makes a pass over and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr has also recorded two goals in the match. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr after the game told reporters from across the Atlantic that Giroux had warned it would be a great evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &amp;quot;I told him before the game he would give his hat-trick&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &amp;quot;I felt it.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &amp;quot;Sometimes it falls on you feeling&amp;quot; Jagr said after his action Giroux scored a goal in the Flyers&amp;#39; first shot. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the goals for the Hurricanes to the puck and presented it to the scorer Max Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer raided, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Concretely Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal. </seg>

<seg id="472"> It is the fact that the back line was sick that especially bothered the coach rather than local Poins lost because they played the game with only five defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &amp;quot;This sucks&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="474"> &amp;quot;We played the game with only an experienced player, the rest were young.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &amp;quot;But we don &amp;#39;need to do anything, it&amp;#39;s like this,&amp;quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &amp;quot;Replacement of replacing it was not enough and we were not able to resist.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &amp;quot;We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="481"> How did the price of travel since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there were only five in Czechoslovakia travel agents state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies at that time were offering trips especially in the socialist bloc countries, because travel to the west were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, the Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> One important exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination to the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialist era that was not authorized nétait for citizens of the socialist bloc (including for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even in socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union he had an invitation letter if not the individual journey was not allowed. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies also offered at the time of travel to the West, however, he had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a &amp;quot;good knowledge&amp;quot; within the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after that it was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the currency which was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people &amp;quot;politically incorrect&amp;quot; who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovak currency was not, however, exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain funds without the approval of foreign exchange (currency west) to travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Czechs spent their holidays mostly in countries where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs are buying and this habit continues until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travel Czechs have been known since 1989 a great revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although the holiday until 1989 in East Germany and Bulgaria were up, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox that we do not realize today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The abolition of visas in the 90s of last century in the neighboring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short visits especially in Austria and Germany in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could not travel by air for a long time in the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Such organizations in Paris Travel Czechs were sleeping in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical characteristic of a journey of Czechs was at that time to carry with it its own canned food, sausage, etc. ... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which has allowed our tourists after last decades can freely buy Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and average wages increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with links through which air charter contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 90s of last century the Czechs had connections with virtually no visas most developed countries around the world apart from the EU which later facilitated our travels. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, was prepared when the first charter air travel to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as every year of direct air charter emmènent of Czech tourists in the distant warm climates this winter there will be 12 exotic locations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It&amp;#39;s more than 100,000 Czechs visiting exotic countries every year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution happened in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and has allowed our country to settle down completely in the group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history still spent more than 15 000 kroons per person for holidays abroad including ancillary costs. Crowns per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with an unresolved situation &amp;quot;stalemate&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> Nearly 5 months already without football Czech President and risk the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known even after a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk . </seg>
<seg id="512"> However there is still no agreement to vote according to what rule should be performed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association who are unable to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This is completely shown on Sept. 16 when they had to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House unnecessarily in Prague since the negotiation is stuck and it was not even address the question of how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There was no agreement on the fact of who is entitled to vote at the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or officials also invested with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this one point there was a partial agreement since that time also with the help of the Office for the state and law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The differences still remain about the regulation for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is obvious that the executive committee, which in its negotiations planned or extraordinary, does not bring anything to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> The views on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is how the third round to avoid falling in the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &amp;quot;The bone of contention is the fact: either proceed under the statutes or find another model,&amp;quot; noted one of three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the model provided in the third round wins the candidate who receives the most votes as a percentage in the House for which he is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is prepared according to what is told to withdraw that wins the candidate receiving the largest percentage of votes in both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech part examines the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentage of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &amp;quot;Only then it would lose the idea of ​​two previous rounds and that would completely reject the concept bicameral&amp;quot; admits Svoboda including objections from the Moravian part and in which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes into force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas is also Paclik agree even if it considers that the regulation of elections established by the statutes as Pelta advantage among all candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &amp;quot;I hope we vote up according to the statutes of the association&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &amp;quot;For there is still no crazy ideas dreamed up by a representative as during the past General Assemblies,&amp;quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time in his presentations and has defined primarily against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &amp;quot;The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &amp;quot;Football is back on a wave of happiness and there aure more enthusiasm for cooperation,&amp;quot; added the officer who Jablonec among the three has the most experience in leadership as a professional football at the level Regional. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &amp;quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the rules to drawing.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &amp;quot;This can cause a blockage again at the General Assembly&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &amp;quot;I still hope that good will win because&amp;quot; Rajchl said. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time to a common agreement for all parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the match. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The specially chartered flight which had to travel up Podgorice including the Vice-Presidents and Dalibor Rajchl Kucera, did not take off for technical reasons and they sought a variation to take part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be delighted to receive the torn in the sports association of the largest countries and lead to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports should determine the direction of the sport after Czech Sazka&amp;#39;s financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik goes into battle for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of footballers Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not put campaigning for this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &amp;quot;If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I&amp;#39;m not running for election.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &amp;quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,&amp;quot; said Paclik the Czech News Agency (CTK). </seg>
<seg id="552"> Paclik motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl precisely to try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which a priori would be favored to the election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik also emphasizes that if he would win the election that he would only serve as President until 2013 year provided for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> It would function well in an experienced manager and high level but that is not associated with football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &amp;quot;I talked to people who have the profile,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &amp;quot;For me it was terrible when some told me they did not want to be identified with the Czech football right now.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &amp;quot;I would like to change that image,&amp;quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Which, they say, especially Paclik discomfort, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union Soccer Roman Berbr Plzen, controversial man to fame is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing on the vote of the delegates&amp;#39; the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable Pelta occupies this position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &amp;quot;If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &amp;quot;And with the support of Berbr, which is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable to the football,&amp;quot; proclaimed Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What shocked him still is the fact that the name was pronounced Pelta few years ago during tapping as part of an investigation into a corruption case, why Pelta escaped without any sentence. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &amp;quot;I do not know what prestige Pelta bring football.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &amp;quot;And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&amp;quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &amp;quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club Plzen.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In case Paclik triumph in Thursday&amp;#39;s vote, he must prove that he could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, which had ended in a fiasco, thinks the same. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &amp;quot;He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &amp;quot;It has great capabilities&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &amp;quot;It would be able to stand such as the head of the representation.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &amp;quot;But as manager of the Association would not be able.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &amp;quot;I do not put your nose in what I do not know&amp;quot;, which indicates Paclik in September has attracted great attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Referees Committee, now replaced with Ludek Macela Dagmar Damkova . </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik says he would be in to head the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as an example of her leadership abilities and private firms that also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support last May&amp;#39;s triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &amp;quot;I have the strength to change something in the sports world and to make a certain culture.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &amp;quot;I freinerais the influence of certain interest groups that have such a tendency to influence the Disciplinary Committee and Appeals, which leads to situations of bad taste,&amp;quot; added Paclik Chache who expressed opposition to the Head of Daniel Kretinsky Sparta. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with the high level policy would provide for sport more tax money on games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &amp;quot;This is one of the key issues that the new President should address.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &amp;quot;If this is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not take its current binding with the club Plzen as something negative even if he himself says that the President of the AFRT should be &amp;quot;above parties&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &amp;quot;This is not the ideal.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> I see no reason to pass on my club shares Plzen someone if I were to return after a year and a half, &amp;quot;said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised a new constitution for the AFRT that should end the stalemate situations. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, will AFRT the new statutes which should put an end to squabbles in the future about Regulation for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official Jablonec is before Thursday&amp;#39;s meeting in Nymburk very optimistic that today the success of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the September election that has not made promises just to focus on national representation and obtaining funding if elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided to run for the last time just before the General Assembly passed and the two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &amp;quot;People at all levels of football have long been waiting for Thursday and there is a President&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &amp;quot;They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association&amp;quot;, he adds, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, worked many years Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in lépoque Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &amp;quot;Unfortunately the&amp;quot; General Assembly in June of statutes were approved that were not perfect, as they all have noticed. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &amp;quot;If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a president since September,&amp;quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> This is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the attention of delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &amp;quot;If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in case it does not work&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="596"> &amp;quot;It is a principle without which we can not exist,&amp;quot; Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said previously that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl recognizes that in view of his legal training and he knows that his opponent would be his first nominee, Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He did not have long attacked the contrary Tonas Paclik that does not stop criticizing Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &amp;quot;He has been in football for a year and has already had some success.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &amp;quot;His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &amp;quot;This is also why some now have doubts about his character,&amp;quot; said Pelta at his opponent but still, he says, true to the claims he made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> It should be a vitirne football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &amp;quot;And also I would try to complete all cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or following the corruption scandal.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &amp;quot;I would enter immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so we can get enough money for all the soccer,&amp;quot; he told the Czech News Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of persons. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &amp;quot;I should get to know all the employees,&amp;quot; he said at Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are catastrophic scenarios provided with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &amp;quot;If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to surpass him.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &amp;quot;Football needs credibility and it will not get that when there will be headed by a new leader&amp;quot;, as stated optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his public service career. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT begin working hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &amp;quot;If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the&amp;quot; General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected we will start working hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to make systemic changes and the Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to settle the case Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football bring more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &amp;quot;As President I want to take care of football as a whole&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &amp;quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful youth football.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m not saying I will do this alone&amp;quot; Rajchl said in an interview for CTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &amp;quot;I am a team player and want to distribute expertise within the Executive Committee so that each member is responsible for a specific area.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &amp;quot;And I will distribute to difficult missions that football face a major step forward&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &amp;quot;Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticizing others,&amp;quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> He reported, it is said, he would not stand as a candidate because of critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &amp;quot;About me, you know that I work 20 hours a day.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &amp;quot;But I need to know if it&amp;#39;s worth it and if I have people behind me who will always spoke in the wheels and emit doubts about each of my actions,&amp;quot; explaining why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &amp;quot;Many people I have still said that I must not give up because they give up too.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &amp;quot;Its a confidence that I can not betray,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates him, they say, is to continue the work begun with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &amp;quot;Since these last two years there has been a great work done and I do not want to drop it.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &amp;quot;There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not want someone stops them. &amp;#39;, He said with concern that in the case of election of the Miroslav Pelta situation within the Union back to its pre Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &amp;quot;I believe in a systematic and it is something that Mirek Pelta can not do.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &amp;quot;Behind him are people who fairaient football so it would be only for those who have been chosen.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &amp;quot;You can blame me for a number of things but certainly not to support Would somebody&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="634"> &amp;quot;I try to be objective&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="635"> &amp;quot;I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not just those who were chosen </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms again that it would be only one President for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &amp;quot;And if any who say otherwise, I am ready to do their utmost to Moravia&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="638"> &amp;quot;For example, it is time to consider the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and one Moravian whose winners would meet in the first division.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &amp;quot;There would be no situation as at present with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem now is to find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Paclik Tomas, president of the Club of Plzen, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl can not assess his own chances of winning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &amp;quot;I feel ongoing support of the Czech Chamber who elected me as its Vice President and know that with me there will be success,&amp;quot; said Rajchl which envisages among its future success can save tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, contract negotiations with the television and the Gaming Act. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He says instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault at all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> As he said about Pelta &amp;quot;he is disqualified because it lets the Czech footblal lose credibility,&amp;quot; he thinks the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate that has something to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &amp;quot;No one can doubt that in Plzen has made this year a great job.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &amp;quot;If elected he would continue in what surely was started by Hasek and would not change significantly among persons in the Committees.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &amp;quot;He would not want to spoil its success,&amp;quot; said Rajchl who valued its rivals. </seg>

<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder went on a journey of research during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not fail in his luggage: a swimsuit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back in the water, she watched the cupolas artistically arranged, and swam against the marble Putten, who was waiting on the other side of the pool and never failed to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau converted these pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If a restaurant gave him pleasure, she noted in her book without delay all the interesting details on the type of construction and the building&amp;#39;s history. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by historian Meder architecture and presented them in his book already published: &amp;quot;Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath.&amp;quot; The municipal indoor swimming pools in Munich, the palaces of historic Bath Black Forest, &amp;quot;Hardcore concrete buildings&amp;quot; in the Taunus. </seg>

Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Germany&amp;#39;s 46 years is a real earnest the bathroom culture. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Meder, explained that she did not have much interest in sport but ell is attracted to water in a totally different way. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It is irritating that the supporters of swimming must be content to contemplate the blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the intoxicating perfume of spruce forests or can listen to the chirping Bird Park merry. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &amp;quot;I wondered one day why the pools are in fact always be so ugly,&amp;quot; said the Viennese. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &amp;quot;So I started a collection of fine bathroom.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The water surface reinforces doubling architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of well-being in the halls of swimming are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builders would have given a little more trouble, the rooms could be swimming a delight for the eyes: &amp;quot;Instead of a floor was a water surface in swimming halls.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &amp;quot;It is a transparent side, but reflects on the other hand, however, the beauty of the whole building.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All surfaces appear optically a double way: high arches, colorful tiles, stepping stones. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The image volume small format &amp;quot;Badefreuden&amp;quot; is a noteworthy report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture of the oasis of wellness history - it gives certainly want to take a leap into blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The collector Meder discovered copies remarkable during his research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Besides the baths welfare splendid as the Széchenyi Bath 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a spa bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building shaped bottle. </seg>
<seg id="670"> By cons, heated pools outdoor Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a roof bath Zürich was the city in his eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snow from a restaurant in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which one can view the animation on the ski slope. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the design of the most extraordinary pool awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aqua Dome looks like a UFO that has landed on the Alps. </seg>

<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> the smell of bleach does not emanate from all pools in the collection Meder. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, Árpád-spa in Miskolc Hungary emanates a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbon which is almost black and its mud sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During his search of beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, an outdoor pool and free outdoor Czechoslovakia, she was faced with a field barricaded. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath designed by Dusan Jurkovic architèque in 1902 was closed in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Casting a glance out the window of the building in Art Nouveau-red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> She observed the opposite effect in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The palace of baths of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building has already survived three phases can discover not only neo-Roman elements emerging from its conception in 1844 but still room Moorish style Alhambra which was added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace thermal still the favorite bathing pool of expert, Iris Meder - and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s already a nice performance as melting building styles so different in so formidable a unit,&amp;quot; said Meder. </seg>

<seg id="688"> German bank abandons it&amp;#39;s speculation on commodities? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to information SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann appointed a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the group leader will then draw conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: In one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculating in commodities such as corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue them this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world&amp;#39;s poorest. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report from Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author emphasizes Harald Schumann in this article as speculation stock exchange on global commodities, pushing prices up and the banks share a complicity in the global famine. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign to protect consumers effectively aligns against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Speculation in commodities was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But most experts share Meanwhile opinion bettors broke free offers and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann responded differently to criticism of U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, &amp;quot;no business is worth jeopardizing the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information of a SPIEGEL ONLINE International Working Group is examining charges of Foodwatch-Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of Deutsche Bank to be presented - with recommendation usual. </seg>
<seg id="703"> In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn. </seg>
<seg id="704"> This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete surrender. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann builds its Image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &amp;quot;Speculation on rising food prices shows a particularly draconian, how the banks Today harm the public interest. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &amp;quot;Deutsche Bank should remove all of its investment portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation&amp;quot; Bode said. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &amp;quot;It does not matter, for Mr. Ackermann, if the issue of starving people, or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> Awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the group&amp;#39;s CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that President of the Board will not change what is provided in the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> It could improve its image with the abandonment of agricultural speculations controversial. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And about potential losses, it has little to worry about - his successor in preoccupy. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Termination by one of two investments in commodities. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> To date more than 30,000 Internet users have already joined the campaign organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode has released the survey Tuesday, which with the November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute has conducted surveys among 1,001 persons. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just one percent thought it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which paris on food prices are made. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would also derive some personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate following the survey, all investments in which money is injected into speculation about the raw materials. </seg>

<seg id="721"> 21st house in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion has moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> In Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with the ups and downs and a happy ending: the Austrian Pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 has won awards, was a museum in Vienna, has remained empty and fell into disrepair. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it has reopened and serves as home exposure. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If we enthusiasm for postwar architecture modern, for its clear shapes, glass hangar, his paces bright and bold and new construction materials that are typical of belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Fair in 1958 is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pavilion Schwanzer once received the &amp;quot;Grand Prix d&amp;#39;Architecture&amp;quot; for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Construction is seen to this day as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He has made so famous architects, he also built the Pavilion for Expo next Austrian. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary home of BMW four-cylinder and its construction adjacent bowl-shaped in Munich, he eventually became famous internationally in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His pavilion project as a temporary structure was exposed after the Universal Exhibition in the Garden of Switzerland at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of 20th century opened - </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang art, not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However it has been used so long, until &amp;quot;that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and was increasingly dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, it is now called &amp;quot;The House of the 21st century&amp;quot; and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a lucky break at any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth among other skater in later at Sotheby&amp;#39;s, the Guggenheim museum as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out the particular alterations to politicians and the protection of monuments, she received public funding and private sponsorship and established operations. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name were exposed, a cafe and a bookstore are there, and one office must be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> To achieve Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because it had transformed and expanded with sensitivity Olbracht secession of Joseph and he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was &amp;quot;a place extremely important &amp;quot;place where he had seen&amp;quot; virtually every weekend &amp;quot;exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness after his trip to Vienna and its change in use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> During the current changes, there were big problems: the &amp;quot;building was&amp;quot; a gulf in energy, &amp;quot;said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of windows on the glass were changed, the insulating glass reinforced fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel sifted between home and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it&amp;#39;s almost a new building, but still light Schwanzer Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red-brown. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the theater is even exactly the same as it once was. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this under close supervision by competent authorities for the monuments and a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &amp;quot;Often materials that are good and cheap to be found, and also that appeal to the Office of the monuments protection&amp;quot;, said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a bare floor in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the &amp;quot;building remained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &amp;quot;which came from Brussels,&amp;quot; said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of &amp;quot;Drop-in-the-City&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture is &amp;quot;always in the wrong place&amp;quot; and still wants to &amp;quot;awaken the conscience.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it&amp;#39;s a fluke of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland stands precisely the &amp;quot;central station area&amp;quot; while newly planned, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck will perhaps occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Art Center Berlin temporary, and as he says It is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of Garden Switzerland. </seg>

<seg id="767"> Last winter the railway company had enormous problems for the transport of &amp;quot;users, because it lacks among other reserves in the event of severe weather. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Thus many new regional trains have been waiting years for a permit from the Ministry of Railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The railway company has for years what to do, since it must check the axles of ICE trains significantly more often in the workshop, after a break axles took place on an ICE Cologne Central Station. </seg>

<seg id="777"> &amp;quot;We are pleased to have found a solution on this, without the parties initiate proceedings in court,&amp;quot; said a partner of Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank has not recognized any comparative fault. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $ 20.5 million. </seg>

<seg id="827"> Following this news, Turkey and the Germano-Turkish population reacts with fear and anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many of the Germano-Turkish spectrum was believed dead long since re-emerged: since the attacks of inflammatory Mölln in November 1992 and May 1993 in Solingen, there is more violence was comparable with that context Right Wing Extremist against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> That there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been a question yet. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &amp;quot;Is this a return to the bloody ideology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;was the title of the publication on the internet the Turkish daily&amp;quot; Haberturk &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &amp;quot;Sabah&amp;quot; stressed however that one of the authors was a v-man on the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of the extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> This is a reasonable way has responded to the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish political thought had a ceremony at the fiftieth anniversary of the recruitment agreement Germano-Turkish. </seg>

<seg id="836"> The reports of some Turkish media give the impression of a slap: &amp;quot;Germany&amp;#39;s gift to the fiftieth anniversary&amp;quot; is the title of an article in the platform-Turkish &amp;quot;Haber X&amp;quot;, which refers to the context series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the publication of German &amp;quot;Hürriyet&amp;quot; does not hesitate to draw unambiguous terms. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &amp;quot;It starts to stink,&amp;quot; This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He points out that people were murdered, would have paid taxes and contributed by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The police action was seen very critically at the Germano-Turkish forum and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to search suspects in some circles of the extreme right, the authors are surprised. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than one shows himself ready to at least rhetorical means even drastic: &amp;quot;If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be migrants nothing but self-defense and armaments&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be much the best self-defense&amp;quot;. </seg>

<seg id="845"> What this means if inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 90s were well explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the ruins after a fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory the German and Turkish. </seg>
<seg id="847"> As no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, what distrust and distance of violence could result. </seg>
<seg id="848"> However, the attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Do not repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> Once this is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the Head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at that time had in his speech, how taxes produced the local Turkish population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media report shows once again how much of the distrust of Germano-Turkish is deep to the &amp;quot;local rule of law since that date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and review of right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message this time is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal in Lake Zürich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The Bank&amp;#39;s most adventurous of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina meantime from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> This is a German who now must lead. </seg>
<seg id="859"> This is certainly not what Axel Weber s &amp;quot;was devised. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we became aware in July 2013 it would occupy a position almost as dramatic: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected career and lucrative. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, greeted, Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength and has recently obtained pass comment on the kind of future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &amp;quot;UBS has managed the Turnaround&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &amp;quot;I look forward to working with Oswald Grübel and Kaspar Villiger.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> Yet as early as September it was clear that everything would change. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader at UBS Securities in London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had blazed around 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the board of UBS Oswald Gruebel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has been regarded as suffering - and all ask: When Weber returned at last? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank in February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And take over the Presidency of Directors already in May - not in 2013, as the bank statement Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Weber it becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> There is no banker, professor of much &amp;quot;economy and President of the bank, and he certainly would have needed an adjustment period. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of &amp;quot;the biggest bank scandal in Europe&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and the other, she skates for years a scandal to another. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, does not spare the Swiss bank so proud. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So UBS was managing a side in 2007 with $ 1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> Moreover, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> It made an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich said: &amp;quot;I have always taken the UBS bank as a model of good to my students.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &amp;quot;In today&amp;#39;s perspective, one wonders: how is it that I could have simply mistaken on this point?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It is profoundly mistaken. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 he appeared for the first time that something was amiss at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In mid-President Peter Wuffli retired, surprisingly, which was considered previously as a senior banker and a great intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later was approached about why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had flamed with documents sub-prime and the write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, UBS announced a capital increase amounting to 13 billion francs and made a cross on it. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For that she actually found investors, but, shortly before, had frowned: a background of Asian non-transparent state from Singapore and a background of Arab state, which was ignored to the point we never even learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This n &amp;#39;that was nevertheless the first shot. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it became worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank would announce further losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board Marcel Ospel, who in 2006 was still the second board the highest paid in Switzerland, retired. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was given his bad investments in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank UBS bought the tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become part owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> All Switzerland was shaken - as she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country to host such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the total assets of UBS&amp;#39;s 2007 &amp;quot;rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &amp;quot;We were not able to save UBS again,&amp;quot; said the researcher banks, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster he was followed by the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data in the affluent, who had evaded taxes perhaps with the help of Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she accepted a payment of $ 780 million - for repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine. </seg>
<seg id="901"> So UBS has published more or less it helped to tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich client: the prestige of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> There followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board and President of the Board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of cash from customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two sectors main business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of using tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as was thought, that UBS would come out, there followed this unfortunate history as merchants: one merchant as a blaze, 7 billion, before the bank realizes that something was amiss. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it publishes: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &amp;quot;With Adoboli the case, it was found that the risk control in too little change,&amp;quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute, University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> As the CFO of a large German bank is sure: &amp;quot;the problem is that UBS did not risk control in hand.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> But it was exactly the idea of ​​prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function, that of becoming a guardian of the great fortunes of the world: not too great a risk, but security for the money - and the world might collapse beyond the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as the Lindt &amp;amp; Sprüngli chocolate are a particularly noble. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The center of the UBS in Zurich is still associated with the solid shot of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank is headquartered in Zurich main station, which leads directly to the central station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snow-capped mountains of Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are prestigious, rents of shops are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewelers like Tiffany&amp;#39;s, they are found here between the stores of Swiss traditions like those of the Sprüngli confectionery. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: the National Bank through the palace to the Credit Suisse private bank Julius Baer as elitist. </seg>
<seg id="919"> We arrive in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are covered with marble, to be located in thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer search here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of ​​the Swiss bank one day either removed from the market - or betrayed the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as chief of a small Swiss private bank located. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would prefer not to read his name in the paper, finally, like all Swiss bankers he also does business with two major banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS would become too large, you find it - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would also common. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss do not have anything to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &amp;quot;And even though they have long since adapted to the manners of the Anglo-Saxon.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This was indeed the investment bank Anglo-Saxon has changed UBS, she made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the major Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent 15 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &amp;quot;On Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&amp;quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &amp;quot;The crash of the UBS.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the large bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If one talks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks have together entered into a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was established, which was too big for the little Switzerland - and has recorded a constant increase. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What helped is that the two banks of different prédécesseuses UBS completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with a focus on the Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer but more certainly already highly internationalized . </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the international investment banks have had a favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &amp;quot;I always thought that Ospel and Wuffli were a dream team,&amp;quot; said the researcher banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &amp;quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, who can hear very well and statistical models, and Ospel, the intuitive, which has found its way to the top with the learning of the bank.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would have relied up &amp;quot;at the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Wuffli and would probably committed at the end a decisive mistake: &amp;quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&amp;quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &amp;quot;This is a tragic fall.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The staff remembers clearly UBS executive meetings during which the group leader Wuffli gave always the same slogan: dethroning Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The U.S. bank was the investment bank&amp;#39;s most powerful on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She ordered the &amp;quot;League Tables&amp;quot; rankings, which were documented at that time the success of banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all the UBS wanted to climb up. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already succeeded him. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisors, who were responsible, however, noted a weakness in the international operations of interest in banking jargon &amp;quot;Fixed Income&amp;quot;, there would be a huge difference compared to larger banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS would have gaps in U.S. Mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, UBS has embarked on an adventure which nearly cost him life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Growth thirsty, it is both the bank itself created a background of management before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It turned into a massive machine that raced and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages - but also retained risk. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks had long sought to descend. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &amp;quot;Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. housing market was in flames, UBS bought there,&amp;quot; said Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> More is great euphoria over the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager after another had to leave, when to end the attempts proved more difficult than we thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions at UBS became ejection and are far bancaux. </seg>
<seg id="961"> He who leads the major bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The researcher bank, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in asset management, return with Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not (yet) go so far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank must wither vigorously, as this is clear up &amp;quot;now. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday the head of Sergio Ermotti bank wants to show the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Italo-Swiss aged 51 was supposed to be only a temporary basis when the bank broke away with surprise by his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, it has become: it must lead sustainable business of UBS, a statement Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not suffice. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what does she make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that &amp;quot;Axel Weber has probably already asked. </seg>
<seg id="976"> He said publicly only that far fetched an apartment with his wife in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>

<seg id="1014"> Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities resident complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> An antidote against the &amp;quot;No problem bird&amp;quot; is not yet in sight. </seg>

<seg id="1020"> Hunting, development and the felling of trees typical of brooding made life difficult for the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The crows are under the protection of nature. </seg>

<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical noise caused by birds: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a lot of communication, these birds have much to say.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to get to a treat but they make their own tools as tools. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Ethologists of Cambridge University recently were testing four rooks, how come the intelligence of birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In one experiment, the birds quickly learned they had to do with scaffolding collapse stones to thereby achieve a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much practice, they recognized that a stone was to be determinately certain size and shape to collapse the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second trial, crows were smart then solve the problem more stocky. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Placed vertically in a cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Entitled &amp;quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War&amp;quot; (The beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), he begins with a long list of characters who shakes your heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> A tip to get started: Carefully tear this page and make it your bookmark. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You&amp;#39;ll learn about these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be confused and desperate in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Here he wrote a book that describes unusual, accurately, as &amp;quot;a work of anti-history.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It features some familiar names, important treaties or famous battles, we find almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, a &amp;quot;book describing what it would look like.&amp;quot; Included are &amp;quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &amp;quot;The beauty and sorrow&amp;quot; summarizes experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less common on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls to botanists and climbers, to doctors, paramedics and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war. Some lose limbs, become mad or lose their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives here as flickering candles of a church: while some go out, we turn back to new. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Peter Englund&amp;#39;s book departs from traditional history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It gives the lie to the idea that the First World War is about more than the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &amp;quot;The beauty and sorrow&amp;quot; aptly describes other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids, the tsetse flies are a problem intractable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving from the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> War invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina such a stinking of cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When the cannon sounded in the distance, and you are a housewife, do you stay or do you fly? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who will come anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly anyone can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, &amp;quot;the lack of facts has been expanded by the assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &amp;quot;The beauty and sorrow&amp;quot; following individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a nurse in English of the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but more are preserved due to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most tackle deprivation and ability to cope. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In telling the story of a schoolgirl German, Peter Englund wrote: &amp;quot;ersatz, ersatz everywhere.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &amp;quot;Coffee substitutes, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, tires, paper wooden buttons.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He goes on food replacement in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes the &amp;quot;meat made of cooked rice crashed into the mutton fat (and finished with a faux wood bones); tobacco made from dried roots and skin dried potato; soles of shoes wood. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> It says &amp;quot;837 licensed meat substitute is recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 coffee substitute.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories deal with honor and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and says of the war: &amp;quot;You feel that after all, this is what men were destined, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretend that such a coating is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched shirt and studded. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier realizes he may well die, and nobody will notice or do not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &amp;quot;When one is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience,&amp;quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> This is unfortunately quite comparable to &amp;quot;a strangled man sentenced in secret.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations concerning the decline of old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &amp;quot;The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition&amp;quot; writes Peter Englund, &amp;quot;a war between the plants.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It took the arrival of what he calls &amp;quot;a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically convinced, well-trimmed clothing, running his butcher while sitting behind a desk . &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People act in unexpected ways, there are as many basic behaviors that heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes to avoid the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &amp;quot;We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, the soldiers and buy s&amp;quot; spread to the genitals in hopes of finishing in the hospital, &amp;quot;he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &amp;quot;The most desperate apply on the eyes, which results in blindness for life.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund&amp;#39;s prose is supple but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to its task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, he grasped the way the war has &amp;quot;unleashed uncontrollable forces only: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People begin to wonder why their leaders are a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books on World War are often indirect, such as &amp;quot;Great War and Modern Memory&amp;quot; (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or &amp;quot;On the Western Front&amp;quot; by Erich Maria Remarque rather than comprehensive. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Peter Englund&amp;#39;s book is an unconventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most damning piece I have read in a non-fiction work. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do not reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had emerged from his book, before it hands the page containing the list of people and burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a first false step, a carefully planned operation </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be most empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation remained secret to all except a few senior officers and other informed at the outset that they would conduct an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence on the possible risks and challenges for the Police Department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> He could not be any repetition of &amp;quot;episodes in recent weeks, such as using pepper spray against protesters, who went against the Department&amp;#39;s regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The operation to clean the park of its demonstrators Zuccotti was deployed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> S police &amp;quot;were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A capital exercise was organized on &amp;quot;Randall Island, for the operation in Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures which are to quickly move large numbers of police officers - a focus on lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was held Monday evening, near the East River from Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to move into the park succeeded &amp;quot;at the last minute,&amp;quot; said a regular, referring to the operation as &amp;quot;a simple exercise.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &amp;quot;The few police officers I know and who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park,&amp;quot; said the person on condition of anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &amp;quot;The only ones who know they are there to make it top of the hierarchy of the Police Department.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The city has attracted a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Oct. 14, police wanted to clean up the park but are made by pushing hundreds of protesters informed of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Tuesday&amp;#39;s operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces across the district - dozens of officers familiar with the neighborhoods especially criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went in the park during the day, how to migrants. One o&amp;#39;clock was therefore a propitious time. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &amp;quot;It is appropriate to make the park when the fewest people,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Of emergency services vehicles equipped with spotlights and speakers gathered at Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and messages recorded resounding speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While community affairs officers were entering the park equipped with their light blue windbreaker, many protesters have simply gathered their belongings and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No tent was hit before 1:45 Police said, which left time for occupants to collect their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other police teams have been sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists at the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of Police, said the measure had been taken solely by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the work inside the park, roughly detained by officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the police was moving westward through the thick tangle of business demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags full of clothes, crews from the Department followed sanitation, cleaner all that the occupants had left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved methodically to stop. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A dozen persons at the epicenter of the camp were hooked together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Emergency services were called to cut the padlock. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests have taken place in the park before 3:30 said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to police, the cleaning operation was completed about one and a quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> most &amp;quot;disturbing public order and rebellion.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of Police, is the senior officer s to &amp;quot;be found at the scene. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although present, &amp;quot;not to direct the operations,&amp;quot; said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of police were waiting along the side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, where assistance is needed. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> We saw the police broaden the scope beyond Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people to keep them away. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Nearly 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the most vivid of the night took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5:00, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a car Police. Others were seen trying to puncture tires of a police truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood flying arose from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of the city continuing school aid for layoffs </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union representing hundreds of educational assistance who lost their jobs last month plans to bring a lawsuit Wednesday in the city for layoffs unnecessary and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionately on schools serving disadvantaged students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, District Council of 37th, to try to overturn the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six one hundred seventy-two aid school, parents and coordinators of other employees, part of the lowest paid of the city, have lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders have compared the dismissals to a political revenge for not having left the city for access to a fund managed by health care worker groups, and that would have to close the budget gap last spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget ended in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> One Board member responded, stating that the dismissals of school aid n &amp;quot;were no specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The officers of the Council&amp;#39;s 37th District said they would fill a notice of claim, notifying the department of education he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce lawsuits in the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis M. Walcott and the department of &amp;quot;education of the city will be the defendant. The plaintiffs are represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or Hispanic-American, like most school aid who have lost their job. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore can not comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union would build on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest neighborhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying the poorest schools lose the most aid due to underfunding regular. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While one does not have any dismissal on Staten Island, and some only in institutions or TriBeCa Upper East Side, 17 assists schools have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts South Bronx neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five assists in eight school employees in 36 public school in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claim that &amp;quot;This is not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring money for fill the gap budget. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the &amp;quot;Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry of&amp;quot; disadvantaged student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also claims that the directors of high schools have been misled by some words in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo uses the term &amp;quot;tolerance&amp;quot; to describe the action, even if &amp;quot;overshoot&amp;quot; describes generally the action of moving a school teacher to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the draft complaint, &amp;quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;not only because of tolerance&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on the issue of Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems finally that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Lybia. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the U.S. involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The foreign relations committee of the Senate will decide next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauded the Libyan people for their rebellion and U.S. troops for their &amp;quot;courage&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &amp;quot;This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&amp;quot; said John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may be harmless but the debate over Libya has never been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators from both parties are in conflict, and with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, McCain and Kerry introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been a Senate vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for U.S. operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The U.S. mission has remained a form of purgatory legislative - Congress upset enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut his grass underfoot. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell under insurgent in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee &amp;quot;welcomes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;welcomes men and women of U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism fantastic. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also says &amp;quot;the national interest of the United States to achieve a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measure does win the support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or she divide legislators as last June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Senator and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the final version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, backed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), be the first constitutional amendment on budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments but not without trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The Goodlatte amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the House only to the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who &amp;quot;would control federal spending.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to bask their resume - the chance to boast of being the &amp;quot;author&amp;quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Law on Control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August called for the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted on a nonbinding resolution supporting the idea of ​​such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and healthcare, among other topics. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as the amendment prohibiting desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to authorize the cancellation of federal law if two-thirds of the States were opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So eager they were, the members to offer amendments, they are not as rapid as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> During the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, 66 and introduced during the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slows relative to the early 1990s, when members proposed amendments generally more than 150 every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments did not have much more success they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &amp;quot;Massacred but not beaten&amp;quot; says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shot him at point blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D - Arizona) appeared Monday night in a TV show, sang &amp;quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&amp;quot; from Broadway and said they wanted above all to recover rather than return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> During his appearance on the news &amp;quot;20/20&amp;quot; on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled to form sentences and needed assistance to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The &amp;quot;issue discussed his difficult return after the ball that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote the text on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> During his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said &amp;quot;pretty good&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of one hour of &amp;quot;20/20&amp;quot;, broadcast on the eve of the output torque of the new book entitled &amp;quot;Gabby : a story of courage and hope. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The &amp;quot;special program traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In video filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, you can spot on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She manages to use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors teach him how to run simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Movement of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, his first words: &amp;quot;What&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&amp;quot;Toast&amp;quot;) to request to change the menu of breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos released by ABC shows the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors look of Cyndi Lauper &amp;quot;Girls Wanna Have Fun&amp;quot; and Tom Petty &amp;quot;Free Fallin &amp;#39; ? &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said he did not remember the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, it was just him reading about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and aggressively treated while awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &amp;quot;There were many dead,&amp;quot; said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &amp;quot;Hard, hard, hard.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During her recovery, said Mark Kelly Diane Sawyer, she said &amp;quot;I was beaten.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &amp;quot;So I would say,&amp;quot; Gabby, you have not been beaten, &amp;quot;said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you&amp;#39;ll get out, you recover and come back even stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More pity than respect for the troops </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad about the powerlessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in suit and tie stood up to his feet to cheer. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &amp;quot;The military men and women, are considered heroes,&amp;quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the fundraiser in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A high-ranking military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of &amp;quot;Staff of the armies of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &amp;quot;They were presented as a kind of orphan,&amp;quot; wrote the high-ranking military in an email. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I&amp;#39;m sure the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But that &amp;quot;was not respected. Just pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that moved between the military and American audiences passionate but often remote. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Are lavished praise the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say some military. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly as if he were sorry for men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &amp;quot;We are not victims at all,&amp;quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &amp;quot;But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, not wishing to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the anger of the troops revenantes of the Vietnam War was far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most conversations take place on pity in confidence among veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of his two son&amp;#39;s battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some people would watch with respect as they were faced with insurgents and have traveled to distant lands. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others are wondering if &amp;quot;a veteran angry and violent lies beneath the surface,&amp;quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in Government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When looking for a job, he said, he felt that some persons who were passing interviews subtly asked if he could bear up under the stress of demanding jobs in Washington immediately after his return of combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &amp;quot;When you approach this service, you are faced with negative impressions,&amp;quot; says the Colonel Cancian when he talks to his son. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Difficulties Military emerge, in part, from indifference to American wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The victories are rarely welcomed by a country as unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &amp;quot;As a nation, we do HARVESTING more heroism in the same manner as the Second World War,&amp;quot; said Lt. Gen. David Barno retired, who led troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of the people and politicians focus largely on the depth of suffering of a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are known for the number of periods of service endured, the number of lost friends or extent of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The military face increasing pressure to take action against rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a hearing will decide whether capital 28 men and women will go to trial against the Army for alleged inaction on rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Where applicable, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> C &amp;quot;was in October 2008. She was returning to his barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dining with a friend when she met a fellow carrying a pack of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; was a red flag, &amp;quot;said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texan has set aside his concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &amp;quot;It is Texas,&amp;quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &amp;quot;I should have followed my intuition.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed her from behind, knocked down and raped, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, Nov. 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, anxiously await the court decision in a trial to be held in historic Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a lawsuit brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape within the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also argue that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke says to attack the military laced, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &amp;quot;The army is a vertical structure,&amp;quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &amp;quot;Who are the individuals in a position to&amp;quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Counsel also stated that since February, she was contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, many of which could be part of future lawsuits. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of collecting all the complainants in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it will institute a number of trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Court documents obtained by Newsweek, detailing the strategy of defense, and basically the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers or off duty for injuries in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries to personnel on active duty. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &amp;quot;The harm alleged is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs&amp;#39; documents indicate. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Department declined to comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 50s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have still not officially allowed to go into battle, this distinction is made only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important, particularly for contact with local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result of these two wars, 150 female soldiers were killed - two thirds in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time to modernize the army said Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in most of his. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At the &amp;quot;Yale Law School, the legal service of veterans prepares a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnosis of &amp;quot;personality disorders&amp;quot; attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively Ordinary, according to activists like Anu Bhagwaru Service Women&amp;#39;s Action Network Action Network (military women), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group has filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to process applications for benefits for people who report having been victims of sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine bills independent of each other have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded from the center of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon&amp;#39;s own estimate, this represents about 13.5% of 19.000 incidents that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report published in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of registered cases in the military have been a trial - half the percentage of the civilian justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of rape within an hour after the event. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she said, she was asked to recount in detail 11 times her rape at different police officers, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She underwent a &amp;quot;rape kit&amp;quot; (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut on his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge at a trial in which it is asked about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six witnesses testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &amp;quot;I remember the day the verdict was delivered,&amp;quot; said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &amp;quot;I thought I would start having contractions. I started yelling at the court.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &amp;quot;I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander&amp;quot; It was not his trial but mine &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Is that the case of Lyman and other plaintiffs will advance or not, this is a long history, said John Turley, a law professor at the Law Faculty of the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he notes, &amp;quot;In my opinion, they should move on.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticized the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrents arising from responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &amp;quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it is important that they try,&amp;quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things change only when the good have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, counsel for the plaintiffs, will bring together the hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &amp;quot;We continue to fight against the army on this issue until there will be no reform,&amp;quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where up &amp;quot;that we die, one or the other of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just a guy expressing his anti-immigration line. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, who admitted he was taken to a killing spree in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being over cyberspace: he had spent much time before the attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions who support nationalist extremist groups right on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy this summer, researchers interested in learning more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy ... Connect to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &amp;quot;We realized that no&amp;quot; was not that hard to find them, &amp;quot;said Jamie Bartlett, author of a recent report by the think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is full of so much personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find people they want with scientific precision - how marketers have done for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The &amp;quot;team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half-million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. She has targeted with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product ads inviting users to answer a survey. The questions concerned their education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and her colleagues were able to question 14 10.000 supporters of extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &amp;quot;This is a new way of doing research,&amp;quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some results are not surprising at all: fans online right-wing groups are usually men, young and against immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &amp;quot;people associate activism online and offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The &amp;quot;study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to investigate all matters affecting health issues such as social trends, thanks to &amp;quot;Like&amp;quot;, publications on the walls and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With over 800 million active users who add content by an average of three days, the &amp;quot;supernova data&amp;quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you could not close the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &amp;quot;Before, when you were trying to conduct surveys of people of British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &amp;quot;You had to go to the party, but they do have never allowed to enter,&amp;quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &amp;quot;Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who talked about their exploits on Facebook while intoxicated had a lot more likely to be alcoholics than students discreet about it. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &amp;quot;You can not treat a problem if you do not diagnose,&amp;quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, behavior and child development at the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &amp;quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and that would in another case not recognized.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The &amp;quot;team site that deals with data studied statistics on the situation on the day of love and Valentine, the turnout in the midterm elections of 2010 and a National Happiness Index (using information only available - the champions of freedom digital have long argued that the site could make available his wealth of data to other persons for research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles, the site is authorized to access your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when it Facebook users are part of an investigation they have not even heard of? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &amp;quot;I do not think that many users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&amp;quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &amp;quot;As much as they know, exchanges were seen by their friends.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how true a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &amp;quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two totally different things,&amp;quot; says Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his experience as a research technology, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and pen are the best tools we can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &amp;quot;Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,&amp;quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &amp;quot;Social studies is supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not at a computer.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &amp;quot;Cold and inhuman&amp;quot;: the first appearance of Anders Breivik Behring </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Behring Anders Breivik, the man who admitted organizing the two attacks that have left 77 dead in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter &amp;quot;resistance&amp;quot; during his first appearance at the trial that takes place in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &amp;quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement in Norway and the Knights Templar,&amp;quot; he says before a courtroom filled with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &amp;quot;Regarding the court&amp;#39;s jurisdiction, I reject, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &amp;quot;I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge interrupted Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue because it &amp;quot;would not allow him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to relatives of victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim judge also asked the police to keep in custody Breivik twelve weeks more, he was forbidden to speak to the media for four weeks and warned that authorities would monitor very closely all correspondence and requests for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Thirty survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came hoping to look into the eyes Breivik, others to be sure it would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &amp;quot;I found it cold and inhuman,&amp;quot; said one survivor Utoya the Norwegian television channel NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &amp;quot;I don&amp;quot; was not comfortable, but I have personally made some progress after having seen and heard the suspect. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when entering and exiting the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of &amp;quot;resistance&amp;quot;, the judge determined that he was not mad. He also said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may give comfort some. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this does not reduce grief or confusion felt by the whole nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &amp;quot;I would have preferred it looks like a monster, but this is not the case,&amp;quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &amp;quot;It would have been much easier.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, the movies this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some have compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical genius and inventor of the modern computer. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs recently and found to be broadcast this week in the first part of a film in major markets, this is how he understood the creative process and workflow products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was definitely a creator and a dreamer. He was identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, and an enhancer of charts - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a &amp;quot;disease into thinking that a great idea because 90% of the work ... [but] a considerable amount of manual labor separates a great idea for an exceptional product. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &amp;quot;Triumph of the Nerds&amp;quot;. This series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, to a popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transit. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Only after the death of Steve Jobs is a complete video found in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly rising, is the basis of the film entitled 68 minutes Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, to be shown at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known for hate-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to exhibit technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> From four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the issues - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to give a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> We also discover moments when Steve Jobs&amp;#39; perfectionism resurfaces, he seems eager to hear issues Cringely, giving nudges to do it faster and proceed to questions or topics of utmost importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the &amp;quot;era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient in Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it considers good or bad in other companies and expressed his own vision on the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It&amp;#39;s one thing to look at the reviews of the posthumous career of Steve Jobs, but there is something raw and inspirational man we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He then explains away the dishes out. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here&amp;#39;s a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> About how he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &amp;quot;All these years I always asked: &amp;#39;Why are you doing things?&amp;quot; and the answers are always the same: &amp;#39;Oh, just because you have to do. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why, no one is thinking deeply to things in a company. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs goes on to give details of its efforts to simplify accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Confused as to how costs were recorded - it often begins with a &amp;quot;standard cost&amp;quot; estimated at a rough guess, and then adjusted with a &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; - he developed an automated factory which guaranteed the accurate calculation of trade costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> The opportunity to play a trick to Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &amp;quot;Blue Box&amp;quot; which he founded with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone systems and call for free long distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The unit has been the subject of many writings previously, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He described how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, via a call and then by connecting an AT &amp;amp; T network to another while bypassing many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &amp;quot;We wrapped it the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and it happened to you a minute later the public telephone next door,&amp;quot; says Jobs, laughing. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &amp;quot;We were young and with this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something themselves able to control billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We did not know much about them both, but we managed to invent a small thing can control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not think Apple has ever existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two friends go on laughing just before the Pope himself is awake. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On his love with the technology (and solicitation of Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> In the &amp;quot;age 12, hunting for parts to build a frequency counter, he looks Bill Hewlett number in the directory and gives him a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20 minutes of conversation, Steve Jobs gets a summer job part-time at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &amp;quot;This has had a remarkable influence on me. C&amp;quot; was the only company I had seen at that age and this has shaped my definition of a business and how employees are treated. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the &amp;quot;first computer ever made.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as big as a suitcase, had a small CRT. I fell in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The teenager that I &amp;quot;was returned to HP and began writing programs for this machine. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Improvisation on innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working only 30 days credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &amp;quot;I remember the big fights ... I shout at me claiming he would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $ 300]. I&amp;#39;ve had enough, I got out and went to a designer. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Eighty-six days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $ 15 and that proved incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies that run out of steam: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he might renew Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better printer copier or better, and after?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it is these types of people] that ultimately lead companies and specialist personnel are being produced in the &amp;quot;margins of decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product engineering that led to this monopoly is rotten by people who can not imagine designing a good product from bad product - manual labor required. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This is what happened at Xerox ... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> She could have done ten times its current size. Xerox was the Microsoft of the 90s ... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They snatched defeat to victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &amp;quot;A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea for an exceptional product ... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot about its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are trade-offs ... Some things you can not do, the electrons can, glass, spam, plants also. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You need to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) assembling them together. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and try to bring these things to the product that you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We always ashamed to steal good ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have just found the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If this is for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health law when the court meets </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day the Supreme Court meets in camera to consider the question of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama&amp;#39;s health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm will defend the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was located last Thursday when nine judges met for a conference to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One case in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the health care reform ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument between 5.30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be likely to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the moment the court&amp;#39;s decision will be made. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will stand before the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a group dedicated to defend longstanding legal principles conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day is one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference the court on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican and outspoken opponent of the law of health. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Featured dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they probably would argue with the code of Canon 4C, which states: &amp;quot;A judge may attend fund-raising organizations and other related law that the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or included on the agenda of such an event. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two law firms of the case, and to a firm with a financial interest massif, was enough to alarm the activists of Government Ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &amp;quot;This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges as the Court shall respect the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,&amp;quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &amp;quot;Judges and drank and dined at a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and participation in the fundraising event belies any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they too easily blend the business of the court with the agenda of groups like the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&amp;#39;s wife, Ginni, is an activist conservative high-profile. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, the Conservatives claim it is the judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law were raised at the trial court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pushed for Kagan recuses himself to hear the case, saying she was too invested in defending the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan gave no indication that she would. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing recorded a record order of $ 18 billion for airliners </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners twin-aisle, with the option to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over one billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Instead, this is a big deal when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 had reached a record $ 18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally amazing is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine growing future aircraft orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years to 2520 had a total value of $ 450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> During the weekend, Boeing informed the control of commercial aircraft the most expensive in history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It&amp;#39;s Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this Pharaonic command. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced at Dubai Airshow in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total amount of the order to $ 26 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts of fuel economy and passenger amenities. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six aircraft s &amp;quot;amounts to over a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &amp;quot;This is clearly very positive for Boeing,&amp;quot; said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &amp;quot;These customers in particular have immense value.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have many of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> They not only afford these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important costs - they would not be so harmful as the country would benefit from the money with the rise in oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because these companies are less likely than others to cancel or defer aircraft orders when oil prices rise, reported Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &amp;quot;They have a natural hedging,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Emirates strengthens the control of the dominance of Boeing in the market for jumbo jets and helps stop the attempted encroachment of rival Airbus with its A350 aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&amp;#39;s victory in the airshow comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the debut of the bigger version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus pushes its inception to increase the thrust at the request of its customers to increase its carrying capacity and autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Shares of Boeing rose 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of the Mexican president clearly defeated in elections in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Maria Luisa Calderon says drug dealers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo PRI in the race for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its access attempt for Governor of Michoacán during violent election, and said Monday that drug traffickers have encouraged one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of that state from the west. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &amp;quot;The involvement of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only in Michoacán but for the whole country,&amp;quot; noted Maria Luisa Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the election. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &amp;quot;They threatened our candidates, our polling agents ... They took the ballot boxes, have set up roadblocks ... and forced people to vote&amp;quot; for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until &amp;quot;to lose the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But he organized his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the &amp;quot;presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have stood out as little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before Election Day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, Vallejo refused to recognize the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Party of Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently serves as governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 left the divided and unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognize the early results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the &amp;quot;State, has denied any links with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialize in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> This is the &amp;quot;home state of President Calderon, and he chose to Michoacán launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Yet violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before the election of a mayor PAN was assassinated while campaigning for Maria Luisa Calderon, and many candidates have given up locally in the country for fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections in Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, Vallejo congratulated in Washington and said, &amp;quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for next year.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The ADB urges Asia to help the euro area </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare for the euro area to help overcome the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of &amp;quot;Asian economy. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, Director General of the Manila-based ADB said that the two economic powers in the fastest growing in the world would &amp;quot;do everything in their power&amp;quot; to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a &amp;quot;with indifference&amp;quot; and reported that Asian financial support alongside management and resources of Europe would to &amp;quot;avoid a collapse of the long-term&amp;quot; global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re all in this crisis.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &amp;quot;So anyone can help Europe recover from the crisis is helpful,&amp;quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &amp;quot;Asia can be protected up&amp;quot; at some point but it is not safe. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &amp;quot;So if China and India can help, nothing&amp;#39;s stopping them.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of borrowing is dangerously Italian skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has brought forth fear that the &amp;quot;global economy goes into recession, and prompted the call for major emerging economies to meet the euro area to help find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag has foretold that the IMF would carry any help Asian, but he also said that the bilateral assistance - like buying bonds of financial rescue funds from the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided a greater power of negotiations with the Asian partners of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India said that &amp;quot;India will do all it can&amp;quot; to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &amp;quot;Nobody wants the euro area remains unstable and agitated,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &amp;quot;We have monumental challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies like India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800 000 live on $ 2 per day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &amp;quot;One day they discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will be hard to swallow,&amp;quot; he reported. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India&amp;#39;s reserves should be used to maintain many Greek officials paid well in low-managed loss making as in railways. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone was likely to cause &amp;quot;significant impact&amp;quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The ADB forecasts economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &amp;quot;risk of loss&amp;quot; because of the European threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed to &amp;quot;develop&amp;quot; contingency plans &amp;quot;to protect an economic downturn and large capital outflows. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Pentagon&amp;#39;s dire warnings about potential reductions in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has raised the pressure on Congress Monday, warning that budget cuts would undermine automatic imminent national security. It triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to gatherings of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already digested $ 450 billion of cuts over the next decade, but now fears that an additional $ 600 or more cuts is imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &amp;quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&amp;quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, cause 23% reduction and the freezing of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &amp;quot;A large cut, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and our construction projects unenforceable - you can not buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage the efforts of other modernization, &amp;quot;Panetta wrote to senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &amp;quot;We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so rapidly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the objective.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &amp;quot;These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and our preparation will damage seriously.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The reductions would affect any combat troops, Panetta continued. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &amp;quot;Although funding wartime accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war effort would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the base budgets,&amp;quot; warned Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &amp;quot;The contractor personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that support the war&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &amp;quot;The management staff salaries would be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &amp;quot;The consequence of sequestration on the Defense Department would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as head of undisputed world military power.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &amp;quot;We are strongly opposed to this drastic action,&amp;quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter from Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &amp;quot;This is not a result with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should impose&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &amp;quot;Sequestration is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Panetta&amp;#39;s letter and the recent warnings of senators increased the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon reductions, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he managed himself to the highest office in the Pentagon combining years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knew that he was facing difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense has painted a grim picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no nucleus. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a ship without sailors.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &amp;quot;This is a brigade without bullets.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &amp;quot;This is a fighter without enough trained pilots.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &amp;quot;This is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,&amp;quot; Panetta said during his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &amp;quot;It is a force depressed, ill prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &amp;quot;De facto, it invites aggression ..&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta has stated specifically how further reductions could &amp;quot;generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters, severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could move to ax, including those already tested and some just the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> That list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new field vehicle, replacing the Humvee army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Halt the development and testing of the F35 could generate $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to spot a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at recent headlines shows how deception and lying are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican candidate for President Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach to retire sexually abused boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed the country. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> Congressman from New York celebrity and the Internet Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by issuing early denials contradicted by overwhelming evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of campaign finance violations relating to coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And none of those who lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term of his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories of cheating on tests of school and university are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers were given the test answers to students to ingratiate themselves on their performance evaluations. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who teach the contrary should send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How do we meet deception? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On any given day, studies show you can hear from 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of them are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners are lying on three occasions in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Identify or detect a lie is an essential skill that everyone must learn, both for personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to exclaim &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have made a thorough search for such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One result of the research is that the oldest myths on lies were demystified. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liars look into your eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They stutter, blush or shake does not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A qualified polygraph can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-facial expressions, the formation of the question and response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years reviewing the scientific results in the vast and still emerging body of knowledge on deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a skill that is modern and easy to learn useful to navigate through our complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiation and management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are able to read the others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies &amp;quot;focused on them&amp;quot; while women say no more lies &amp;quot;other-centered&amp;quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone one - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried persons (but the lies they tell tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, observe the normal behavior of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &amp;quot;set benchmarks&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps provide a benchmark for measuring future changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly to avoid accusations unfair when you see it move his feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then search for clues of deceptive behavior verbal and nonverbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices as red flags, no evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People can stop misleading the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean toward an exit, changing posture significantly relieving or present a &amp;quot;post-interview &amp;quot;- an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all questions are difficult past. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to start the reaction post-interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Individuals can also use misleading language distanced: &amp;quot;I have not had sex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&amp;quot; or repeat a difficult question entirely. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &amp;quot;jargon&amp;quot; in his response to a difficult question: &amp;quot;Well ... to be honest ... if I remember ... to my knowledge assets.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the perceptual response rather than factual, is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for lie detection, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will enhance the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal life. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The plan will be controversial pipeline rerouted after the threat of late approval of the United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said late Monday it will move out of the pipeline in the ecologically sensitive area of ​​the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The Official TransCanada Pourbax Alex, says the company remains confident it will ultimately obtain approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further study of potential routes allowing avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, vast underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a real way forward,&amp;quot; said Terry Lee, a Republican of Nebraska at Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after elections next year, though officials deny involvement in policy making. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and he expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline would extend from 2.735 kilometers from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would transport 700.000 barrels per day since the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do this, he would cross six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But legislators of Nebraska opposed the plan are pushing a law to force the remoteness of the area of ​​the Sand Hills and Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact study under the State Department found that the project would cause only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the inspector general of the ministry ordered a separate investigation of review process, focused on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says the Disco diva Patti LaBelle embarked on a rampage in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of the singer &amp;quot;Lady Marmalade&amp;quot; scared the little Genevieve Monk 18 months old, so much so that she suffered &amp;quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;increased fear of strangers,&amp;quot; said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was Nov. 10 last year while the stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to leave for family trip. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk would get the car, Roseanna Monk down in the lobby of their building on the Boulevard Riverside with their luggage, with Genevieve in her arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a while. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &amp;quot;Someone came up behind me and told me:&amp;quot; Do you know what your daughter? &amp;quot;I said&amp;quot; yes &amp;quot;and I went to look,&amp;quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle has angrily admonished pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &amp;quot;She told me in an aggressive tone:&amp;quot; You should not let your daughter near the door, &amp;quot;said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &amp;quot;I told him:&amp;quot; what you say or do does not interest me. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became enraged and began using profanity - the word &amp;quot;&amp;quot; and the word &amp;quot;&amp;quot; in a loud voice ... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water and began to spray water bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She stated that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &amp;quot;I told the woman:&amp;quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &amp;quot;said the mother of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle was thrown on the mother - who was still holding in her arms Genevieve - and had to be restrained by those around him who has driven to a waiting car, Roseanna said Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note demanding an apology from LaBelle, but got no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks damages not specified, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity against the cancer for children. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &amp;quot;The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,&amp;quot; Davis said. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &amp;quot;This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with a child of 18 months.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Adversity climate has slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy contracted </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year that will be remembered in economic history of Sinaloa, is the first year of Government Mario López Valdez, called self-change, which has generated great expectations regarding advances economy, but given the climate of adversity this year, the increase was not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Low temperatures of February, except to cause losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in overall economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, the main reason for the historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of assignments from frosts by the Mexican Council of Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582 million of damage 835 hectares cultivated, including a 78.03 percent have suffered a total and remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography unemployment state during the first three quarters of the the years there has been a fast rise, because while the January-March 053 55 000 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent from July to September and average continued to increase up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74,000 sinaloens unemployed, up from the first half of 18,000 people 969. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly by the actions taken by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &amp;quot;What we observe is an increase in unemployment is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints in the legislation approved by Congress to combat the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars from illegally it is not easy to work to earn them, they invest them and use them in something, &amp;quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration held </seg>

<seg id="1873"> &amp;quot;The number of persons leaving the state to go to work abroad, the U.S. has been limited, primarily because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they have already entered into many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and there asking for sources of work, so that higher unemployment, &amp;quot;said he. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> Court validates &amp;quot;the analogue switch off&amp;quot; in Mexico in 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The substitution of analog by digital REPORTED is an exchange larger than the world has suffered the last year </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called &amp;quot;analogue switch off&amp;quot; from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary for invalidate have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, herein the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, held that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow to achieve the transition digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft award prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because of the fact that the regulation of radio and TV is an award reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications ( Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favor of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero same. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies has promoted two controversial constitutional challenge to the decree and acknowledging complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions under it for digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary session of Ministers also resolved dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discuss the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive can not structure through measures of general standards for public administration is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &amp;quot;I do not consider that if he did it affect the autonomy of the regulator,&amp;quot; and he recalled that the public policy planning in strategic areas such as telecommunications is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate the direction of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitution of analog by REPORTED REPORTED digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last year and this results in better use of spectrum, better signal quality and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postpone the change, argued he would postpone the benefits of digitization involves a public policy decision that has not only a technical dimension, &amp;quot;as it also includes economic, social, political and national security. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These issues, said he, &amp;quot;require the operation of any system shall, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the state, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants the power of the Executive the State &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> He recalled that many countries around the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done through the Executive, despite the fact that they had strong technical bodies specialized. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> We can not conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the form of a sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures the administrative sphere in respect of acts by the Legislature, he assured . </seg>
<seg id="1929"> It analyzes the possibility of a count &amp;quot;vote by vote&amp;quot; in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to data revealed by PREP, the difference between the first and second in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6000 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Count the possibility of &amp;quot;vote by vote&amp;quot; is a reality in regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where according to data revealed by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6000 74 minutes total. </seg>

<seg id="1933"> Recall that Michoacán has not approved nor its Constitution nor the Code Electoral Politics of State or the Electoral Law of Justice, along with the State Congress approved reforms that eventually bit before the legal deadline for the trial election can take effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication on schedule by the Law of the Official Gazette of the State, with the argument that he had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Authority and described as &amp;quot;illegal and invalid&amp;quot; the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reforms, as he has no right to &amp;quot;punish or deny&amp;quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1936"> Thus, the partial count of votes, an electoral or more packets, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide, there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the urn is not in the president thereof, or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Moreover, the total count of votes received in all the polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the supposed difference between the candidate winning the election and respective one that got second place in the vote is equal or below a percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition representing the party&amp;#39;s express and / or coalition presented the second candidate reported. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total count of the vote can take place also if at the end of the countdown common it follows that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner of second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packages were part of the statement object. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 minutes total. </seg>

<seg id="1979"> A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> One might expect that a firm has made in its majority by technocrats, although it is unclear when the new Executive will assume his post. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said he would present to the President the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &amp;quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&amp;quot; said the former European Commissioner for journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &amp;quot;framework is now well marked,&amp;quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process to form a government within three days, in a shorter amount of time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti has to approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy which was affected. </seg>

<seg id="2008"> Stark contrast to that of Costa Rica, when comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today at 15:05 am at National Stadium in San Jose. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> While the national champions and Europe, a number of monthly FIFA rankings, account for a large register sets of inter-selected class A, only the Habs defender Michael Umana was the only one to have all 50 games International. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández. </seg>

<seg id="2022"> The least. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Those who have less. With over 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31). </seg>

<seg id="2037"> Costa Rican for its followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is our second time in South America and Central and so far it has been great. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I spent in Costa Rica vacations only once and is a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> This excites us therefore turn our music down there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What is your message for your most fervent followers? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for staying beside us during all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took 21 years to have until we come to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so much and we are sorry that so much time had to pass up this concert. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people are already saying that his show is the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Is it adds a little pressure to your visit. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the biggest shows we have available during the last 21 years occurred in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We offered a gigantic two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this will put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> We are really looking forward we produce. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we love to surf and the jungle for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best country in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did you discover Costa Rica and waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have lots of friends and surfers I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends would always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, near Mexico, are great places to go surfing, this is how we learned, through the gents who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Seeing the tour, you aves offered huge shows, with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we did never products out there, we have no restrictions regarding what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs and we try to sing two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the directory. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What should it? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think it&amp;#39;s partly because we have nine disks and we can interpret over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that&amp;#39;s why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we no longer interpreted very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved these songs and we may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Looking back, is it hard to believe all that you have succeeded? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First, I think none of us has imagined that we would form a great rock band, and the fact that we have done for over 20 years that it seems a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue making music together excites us a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love making music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places in the world which we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could get better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What does it mean for you having been fundamental in the creation of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This was always an honor for us to form part of this group of large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are friends with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It&amp;#39;s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Occasionally, a group emerges of a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups come together in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and it is an honor for us to form part of the Seattle group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We&amp;#39;re still playing with some of them occasionally. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with them all and it is an honor for us to form part of the Seattle sound that arises. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a group like yours to maintain and united with the same members for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We have to trust each other with the music of everyone and it could be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you could do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game and great multitudes of people who love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us remember that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that one and is a famous rock star, which does not really care about any of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember from your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a group for almost three years and we have not released a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so short and most important is that we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group and when I listening to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an amazing human being and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and why you chose it to open? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and this one was the group that we loved the most, so we&amp;#39;re excited to see what Las Robertas can provide live and this must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why you always change the lyrics Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It was he who sings it and I think it does with the first words he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, what are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many ... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first I remember there Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about bass players that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has managed Pearl Jam grunge keep falling despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful because it &amp;#39; is music worth listening to bands like Mudhoney and are now the best music ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What must change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It&amp;#39;s interesting, because I think there are songs in the album that seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a slightly positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, without doubt, represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that we can be happy and even then you can make music obscure. </seg>

<seg id="2132"> The mustachioed plumber goes to three-dimensional &amp;quot;3D Super Mario Land&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, but he had never done in three dimensions: in &amp;quot;Super Mario Land 3D&amp;quot; he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> The title, which arrives this month in stores across the world, was designed from the beginning to fully exploit the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &amp;quot;Mario is the character who has to say must function as stereoscopy without glasses,&amp;quot; said the head of Nintendo&amp;#39;s press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Alvarez said that &amp;quot;3D Super Mario Land&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this media&amp;quot; as far as success of &amp;quot;Star Fox 64 3D&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Zelda: OCARINE of Time 3D&amp;quot; was the adaptations of existing titles. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The spokesman claimed that Nintendo, despite being in 3D, &amp;quot;3D Super Mario Land&amp;quot; is a video game &amp;quot;accessible&amp;quot; which allows a quick and fluid. </seg>

<seg id="2140"> In addition, users can choose between a real-time &amp;quot;aggressive D&amp;quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &amp;quot;not to succumb to illusions optical &amp;quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contests on 16 doors reopen the debate on the role Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> By the mid-&amp;#39;80s, right peak of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​the Catalan capital is the only one that is not oriented on a north- south, if not above (mountain) - low (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Qualification as Collserola park is to the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was not Central Park Yellowstone otherwise, with wild boar in the role of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a competition composed by mega-16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door gives the idea of ​​park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> That, or someone wants to put doors on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The issue appears alone: ​​Collserola: park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both in terms of its organization as regards the reflection of the city is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It&amp;#39;s almost a recurring theme, including two former members of that caste elected to recognize when they speak in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three coincide Barcelona architects, university professors, who are presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel and Marta Modol Bayona: the competition is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front &amp;quot;it is necessary to&amp;quot; discuss &amp;quot;the front mountain&amp;quot; because the speech Ildefons Cerda, the blocks of green has not been completed at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &amp;quot;We must start from the basis that the largest park is the beach of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &amp;quot;gave the verdict which the architect for the title of&amp;quot; doors Collserola &amp;quot;contains a&amp;quot; trap lexicon &amp;quot;: do they think&amp;quot; like access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where action is needed &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as &amp;quot;intellectual challenge&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;some peril&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers that derive from &amp;quot;the uncertainty of the projection of public space&amp;quot; after the experience in the 80s and was in the area of ​​the Forum &amp;quot;his swan song.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the proper border demarcation on which to build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &amp;quot;Limit means something already established the next step&amp;quot;, that is to say, beyond it. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &amp;quot;We must think of new urban instruments, planning, since the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disaster.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> In addition to the standing question, Modol opine that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles region Collserola &amp;quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, ​​no.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results shown on the accident in which his life has lost the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicate that the helicopter was shocked directly against the floor full structural integrity, without the pilot to try an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary of Transport and Communications, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot noticed that the weather conditions were suitable for flying. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &amp;quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees to 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, he said the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground parts. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &amp;quot;In research we have reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft to another place, the impact is presented in a structural way. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &amp;quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and meet the requirements for transport. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The soil had a Pante seven to 30 degrees inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For now, the Secretary has ensured that priority is to have the results as soon as possible, but the investigation may take several months, it may even last a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services has ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter was operating in Presidential State Major speed cruiser and it happened on soft ground ascendancy. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &amp;quot;This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operating cruiser at the time of impact,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> During the press conference, the owner of TBS, Perez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the normative aircraft, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, meaning that the crew must have visibility during the flight and ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The reports mentioned in the AICM adequate conditions for takeoff, and as and as the aircraft has moved toward the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of clouds at low heights. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that &amp;quot;because of cloud cover conditions the crew had sought a zone of lesser height and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss or alteration of or control the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Scattering of remains of the aircraft in a small area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far to suppose that the impact occurred on a straight path and side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The dispersion model of the remains of the aircraft can be assumed that the helicopter was hit against the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> It did not detect traces of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In place of loss there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During field work we found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9,000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground was on a slope that goes from seven degree C. to 30 degrees inclination . </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which it is possibly disjointed throughout its journey. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements which suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple Hits the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful research in an area wider than the spot circled around the accident, we did not find the scattered pieces of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the obesity gene </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people and this is supported by specialists in the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced he leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, called protocol &amp;#39;Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents, who markers will be associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the Investigation Unit in Biochemistry Medical Specialties Hospital National Medical Center in the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that they had formed a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social attend. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In the investigation be invited to participate or not having the right people, to stand for units of IMSS sports participating in Valle de México, into which any evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 pm. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the protocol began in Unit Sports Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Oriente Estado de México). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After reaching the goal of raising 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and that e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As we celebrate the November 14 World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the objective is to collect three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for application specific questionnaires related to diet. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will also be asked about their physical activity and a history of familial inheritance of their disease, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He explained that on Saturday we will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determining the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (we try to identify people associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez noted that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &amp;#39;The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, from 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; regarding the Overweight was observed as a dramatic increase &amp;#39;, emphasized the specialist IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said the justification for the search of markers is based in the fact that the country&amp;#39;s population is different from the others by its genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 per cent of Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited as fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obese. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Ila said that even the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors transmitted in writing to parents, which explains the different measures and changes in lifestyle that they must achieve to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: a sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, spend most of their day sitting watching TV and using means transport instead to walk short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another cause is the high caloric intake, that is to say, the greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie with cornmeal wrapped in corn husks - bread, pizza, burgers, etc..) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics discussed in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The asphalt of the UNAM avoid currants </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with higher yields, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Reported only if the pavement were resolved, there would be no need to repair about 200 miles blackcurrant each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Valle de Mexico, warns Rafael Nájera Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM , who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is adequate, currants could be reduced or eliminated completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During his lecture An opinion on technology cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those asphalt, but with a greater mechanical strength, both at high as low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of black currant. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt from heavier oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbon molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes, and molecules with low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give to pad its characteristic viscoelastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is in the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state , while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resistance in the streets of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns expert in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher observed that FQ streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the more superficial is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the small stones that form the layer, signalât he is bathed year asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When vehicles spend generating efforts, it allows the forces spread very well in the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If we had to modified asphalt, they would propagate better, opinât the chemical ingenuity. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the asphalt, he said, we put a last layer called surface layer, made of stone cutting, that is to say, the sand is bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must be stronger than the mechanical layer of asphalt and provide traction on the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the wearing course also requires that it has a suitable thickness and the material it is made must be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is that it&amp;#39;s hard it kind, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore because of cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a black currant, he said, the first strike that the film is rolling and is affected only later the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Member of the National System of Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of black currant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must be always connected to the load of vehicles and ensure their satisfaction, for avoid the frequent formation of cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and can easily repair the blackcurrant and without using high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> The candidate has failed in Valle to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of factors that Serna Melina Ramirez does not get the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle received her title of princess number 14. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca again stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Serna Melina Ramirez had to settle with the fact of being on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band as the new princess accredits Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and scepter, the department already amount to 14 tracks and Princess Melina is one to one legion of women of Valle del Cauca, which are found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many people are asking is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What he missed? Because the result is the defeat of a great favorite in each presentation that showed she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been in vain elected Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face Vogue, degrees obtained by Taliana Vargas or queens Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first key factor considered in the decision of the juror to designate First Princess is that it has not convinced with his answer to the question &amp;quot;? What was the book that has marked you and why? Asked by Martín Gómez Murillo, the Carreta Leamos Literaria. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the answer of the candidate from Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &amp;quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think it is a form of cultural terms is, I definitely think the book that marked my childhood is&amp;quot; The Little Prince &amp;quot;, a book that&amp;#39;s deep enough. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment&amp;quot; is a book of universal literature we should read it all and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called &amp;quot;The ardor of blood. &amp;#39;&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This answer did not please at first because of the term &amp;quot;cultural terms is&amp;quot; and second for not explain specifically how each book mentioned had marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result &amp;quot;the universe and wise, it happens what should happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for everyone, please read a little, &amp;quot;The Little Prince&amp;quot; is a great book &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Launched between the assumptions that there is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist in Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the standing ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary price (Oster food challenge, the public vote for best costume craft, and Queen Mother), &amp;quot;it roused the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the queen and that&amp;#39;s why she did not shine on stage. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And we noted that in its first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and her two parades on the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> While the two shows she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she had not the strength and energy representatives of Atlántico and Magdalena. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the &amp;quot;Como en casa&amp;quot; (like home), Canal RCN said that Melina had been designated Princess &amp;quot;confirms that the candidate receiving the most awards during the contest receives not the queen&amp;#39;s crown. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of National Beauty Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> This is why two days before the election the juror international Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed regarding social needs of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &amp;quot;But the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before starting the contest are already involved in projects&amp;quot;, explained it. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It also speculates that Valle sinned by his defects and his behind the fibrosis was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory because the jury specifically elected him as the candidate &amp;#39;Natural Beauty&amp;#39; with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical labor charge. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco queens recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, it was best, &amp;quot;but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, he has left the points on the last day. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgeries she had undergone. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &amp;quot;The surgeries are good, but Valle did not know them. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body has never been his strength and she lost because of this aspect. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For that price, the National Beauty Contest calls for the first time, after the parade in swimwear has emerged a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo had to Melina for not giving him a taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by designation of the National Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who despite his dazzling passing by Cartagena, did not get the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Cali is a dactyloscopist made history as the man who confirmed the death of &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano &amp;#39;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The past 4 1 November dactyloscopist ITC Cali has made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano&amp;quot;, comparing his fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Seven dactyloscopistes working in local offices of CTI, this week it was the turn of &amp;#39;availability&amp;#39; of Eliazar Gonzalez, a man in Puerto Tejada who has worked 21 years in the field of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> Early in his career, González has worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place which contained the corpses that were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 he has been transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking courses adequate, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, that is to say palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to take with him Eliazar clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something very big was waiting. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he went for a helicopter in Cauca Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew he had to identify two corpses and had been suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the world&amp;#39;s oldest guerrilla, therefore he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant from the area, without glasses and much leaner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But the prints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Galton accompanied by a magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye has not deceived: it was of &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the native of Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme commander of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Search of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactyloscopist SIJIN of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &amp;quot;Cano&amp;quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people know not our job. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which may be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from identifying the corpses, dactyloscopistes support investigations for offenses such as theft and homicide, and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take their fingerprints and looking in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher was told that in case of theft he had to remove part of a house wall, in this place because the thief had his hand pressed to release a safe full of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &amp;quot;The walls are difficult because they are not adequate area to derive a fingerprint, but in this case we could get the impression the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights,&amp;quot; recalls it. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also confirm or rule out suspects in homicide cases. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently we found a dead man with drink bottles around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> By the interlude of the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspect of the crime and in fact a mark on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> While this is no guarantee that he the murderer, it places it on the crime scene. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopist ITC explained that the extracted &amp;quot;fingerprint objects with chemical reagents or physical.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, we use a sampler or tape to remove. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database déclinquents, or National Civil Register. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &amp;quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians&amp;quot;, stated the expert from CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that not everything is how it shows in the television program CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Like everything that glitters is not gold, all that we touch becomes not necessarily a footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> It can however be used, if one performs the necessary confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &amp;quot;outraged&amp;quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of protesters jostled before the Zuccotti place to camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large proportion of individuals accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The integral of motion Occupies Wall Street on Tuesday defied the authorities in New York while trying to enter again, thanks to a court order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park from the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of protesters jostled before the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to reach through a court order allowing &amp;#39;outraged&amp;#39; to camp again in this place, while the other&amp;#39;s movement responded to the occupant evacuation park to the north of the city, where there were new cases. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &amp;quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests &amp;quot;said one of the spokesmen of the movement&amp;quot; Occupies Wall Street &amp;quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray has detailed the response of &amp;#39;outraged&amp;#39; at the evacuation of the camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings has issued an order prohibiting the removal forced to place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Moreover, the &amp;#39;outraged&amp;#39; occupied a new park at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the figure concrete, ensuring that it Efe saw some journalists who had been handcuffed too. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there are old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has shifted as a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene on behalf of them before the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, place Zuccotti - which is an enclosure of private property - remains closed until the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which they must analyze the legality of the evacuation this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some demonstrators were previously displaced and distributed at that time copies of the judiciary and they even delivered to the agents who were monitoring the site, which caused &amp;#39;some small clashes&amp;#39; said Bray, who denounced the fact some officials have beat demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of Wall Street Takes up or apply &amp;#39;laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit access to the demonstrators back to the park with tents or other properties they formerly used. &amp;#39; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg said at a press conference that, because of the judiciary, the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and the protesters, whom he warned however that local laws do not allow s install with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Councillor personally defended the evacuation conducted at dawn instead Zuccotti, an operation during which they arrested 200 people and which was decided because of the fact that the protesters &amp;#39;violated the law&amp;#39;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg said he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became &amp;quot;a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to hurt to others &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; some stores received threats &amp;quot;and residents were afraid&amp;quot; to their quality of life &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &amp;quot;The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that deep Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,&amp;quot; added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor &amp;quot; does not respect freedom of expression &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Officials &amp;quot;Occupies Wall Street&amp;quot; have also indicated they do not think of organizing &amp;quot;great deeds&amp;quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began Sept. 17. </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan reborn after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP up 1.5% thanks to a domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral in early March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country from Japanese World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimate of Tokyo Government calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a move that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have lessened. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% a quarter earlier and a 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> That recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of purchases of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami on. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the real stimulate the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that prompts use the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, use of zero failures to thrive. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan woke up mainly through changes in domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable has raised a 1%, driven by increased spending on cars, travel and entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has delivered to market when the yen - the yen - has become a &amp;quot;safe haven&amp;quot; elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and the United States&amp;#39; forecasts disorders, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of export companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country with floating line is determined by the economic health of big technology companies. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor performance between July and September the contribution of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &amp;quot;We must follow the continuing risks, such as deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of yen,&amp;quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of countries have introduced in September clearer signals of economic downturn. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are curbed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> As it fell 100.4 points to four decimal places, compared to 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Eurozone was even with below average, which is in the 100 level, lowering n eight decimal places up 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens again feeds the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written agreement </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With risk premiums triggered devices and reinstalled the uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that leads to the release of the great crisis of European debt. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; of the new transitional government is Hellenic rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels as a real conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and the hundred days will be established in his name can be applied for short, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for the date, that of February 19. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &amp;quot;The main task of this Government is that to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&amp;quot; said Papadimos yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message emerges Samaras no doubts about his position: &amp;quot;We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we&amp;#39;re committed to nothing more&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse qu&amp;#39;UE and IMF, organizations must unlock the 8000 Athens million with emergency needs, and made clear that he will approve a letter of commitment to achieving adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the will of any referendum Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will unlock if using the new Government and leaders of major parties do not sign Hellenic not &amp;quot;a written undertaking without ambiguities as early as possible.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; in Athens to discuss with the new Government &amp;quot;the elements necessary to pay the sixth installment&amp;quot; of 8,000 million, although there is a definite date either. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greeks have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Queen Sofía: &amp;quot;They are instruments for the progress and hope&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> Queen highlights the place &amp;quot;casting&amp;quot; of Spain regarding this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &amp;quot;has reached a prominent place in the global role of Micro-Finance&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Queen Sofia said that the country has become in the past two decades the second donor in the world regarding this cooperation instrument whose &amp;quot;essence&amp;quot; lies in the fact that it is &amp;quot;an instrument for progress social justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that &amp;quot;there is no doubt&amp;quot; that such operations are &amp;quot;absolutely essential&amp;quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &amp;quot;very special, in that which has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below one dollar a day, which is attached the&amp;quot; poverty line &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &amp;quot;still working&amp;quot; to enlarge the network of beneficiaries &amp;quot;in every corner of the planet, and assumes the task with&amp;quot; responsibility &amp;quot;, reported the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, &amp;quot;ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women&amp;quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have &amp;quot;many purposes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we are facing many challenges.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Microcredit Summit is viewed not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which we must drive &amp;quot;two basic goals.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families who have accessed the financial services and one hundred million of these families out of poverty they live in now . </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world &amp;quot;following the path initiated some years ago a pioneering way&amp;quot; by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as an &amp;quot;act of justice and due recognition &amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she described the father of the instrument as an &amp;quot;idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&amp;quot;, the work which she knows from 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know his field lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &amp;quot;in every meeting I have seen a continuous evolution &amp;quot;said His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term&amp;quot; head of family &amp;quot;meeting in Valladolid from the&amp;quot; fork out the poor. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and finding solutions to advance in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &amp;quot;Ethical imperative&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The External Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned that solidarity &amp;quot;is an ethical imperative&amp;quot; for any democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, it stated that it would be wrong to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a &amp;quot;continuing obligation&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jimenez found that microcredit involve &amp;quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&amp;quot; and now &amp;quot;more than ever&amp;quot; governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow that it is the victim of cutbacks. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &amp;quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; to give &amp;quot;confidence&amp;quot; people &amp;quot;which excluded all close the door&amp;quot;, and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, has welcomed the attendees in a city that &amp;quot;opens contaminated the spirit of solidarity&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage European </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, Nov. 14, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel also Chair of Christian Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally planned but the program has established itself in the fall, especially to meet the activists who consider government policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and can be the Italians tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion of the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Delegates to 1001, only nine voted against and ten abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes that were treated at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea Mistress of the Chancellor - and motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis &amp;quot;is not less Europe but more Europe.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace but because &amp;quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &amp;quot;it is time for a breakthrough in Europe.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen control of the European Union on fiscal policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of President of the European Commission by universal suffrage &amp;quot;to give a face to Europe&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Such is certainly one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress which is clearly the inspiration Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> While it is unlikely that the bloc agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone is set. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to balance the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which of course came back to reinforce the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its conference on the backs of &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; European countries or troubled countries quick to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of the &amp;quot;Franco-German friendship,&amp;quot; Merkel did not mention France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in the hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What is fraud sick? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 at Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social handouts. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in an environment of rigor, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign right, the majority wants to focus on the sick. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, the purpose of budget savings: the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of deficiency before the assumption of a work stoppage. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that could give rise to anger, but that would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: one day impose on staff waiting uncompensated in the event of stoppage of work (they have so far no waiting period, in three days against private). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority stimulus also the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &amp;quot;The controls will be much larger and, in addition, if you&amp;#39;re caught, you will repay,&amp;quot; warned Xavier Bertrand micro RTL, Sunday, Nov. 13. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the actual fraud in the stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is indeed the subject since 2002 constantly monitored and offensive policies, which have generally been successful. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> We dwell first on the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than 237 million daily allowances were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, per diem in 2008 accounted for 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and workplace accidents, and 54% were for the sick, or 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And then 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French were on average 14.5 days off work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> This average hides some differences: another study, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days of sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time of health insurance, says that in 2010, 37% were on sick leave lasting less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) varied, France, between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28 % in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud is very sick little face in the black. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As for fraud, it reaches only a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Strengthening of legislation since 2002 that systematic controls are on sick leave over 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, over 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 achieved for short stops were &amp;quot;unjustified or too long&amp;quot;, or 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases &amp;quot;inappropriate or unwarranted&amp;quot; about 1.2 million, or 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A total of 169,000 cases therefore &amp;quot;unjustified&amp;quot;, over millions of employees who had a sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents little face, for example, that black labor. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9-15000000000 euros of tax shortfall a year, more than the total cost of per diem, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to them. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papademos: Greece will implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This was said Monday, November 14 Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, in Parliament, adding that one hundred days given to his unity government would be insufficient to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &amp;quot;To continue the efforts of economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of fiscal adjustment,&amp;quot; said the prime minister, who delivered his first public speech at the opening debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> Implementation of decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the &amp;quot;main task&amp;quot; of the new government because the country&amp;#39;s participation in the euro area &amp;quot;is at stake,&amp;quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly, Mr Papademos expected that the country&amp;#39;s public deficit will be reduced &amp;quot;at around 9%&amp;quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 % in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> Denies the right of the new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, Monday brought its support to measures already agreed to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not embark on an additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &amp;quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures,&amp;quot; he said during a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and the fight against waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> A Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU do not débloqueraient the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee of all parties would support the measures provided Antonio Samaras said that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> We must legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said an expert committee </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In palliative care, the committee demanded that governments, institutions, health care, and physicians working together to provide better palliative care, and that, beyond the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> Canadian society is living in denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians agree indeed to speak with their doctor the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, attended by six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when a choice, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that &amp;quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And notwithstanding that capacity for most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&amp;#39;s authors arrive at conclusions that go against the federal government&amp;#39;s position, which has already said he did not want to change the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> But according to experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, that is to say the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consenting. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, said yesterday in a conference call Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, we would find many more cases of these excesses in the very countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &amp;quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &amp;quot;Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&amp;quot; said Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians in favor of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow persons at end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that to legalize euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly and disabled has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for those who have practiced assisted suicide, those surveyed 41% believe they should not be pursued. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> For the maintenance or termination of care from a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also, the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stipulated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a refusal is not legally valid criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The expert committee also asks that health professionals are trained to comply with a duty to refuse treatment at end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>

<seg id="2545"> Reserves of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &amp;quot;extreme&amp;quot; the position of experts signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &amp;quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who have over 18 years could ask what the assisted suicide,&amp;quot; said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted a summary yesterday the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr. Deschamps also noted that the report&amp;#39;s authors seem to place personal autonomy above all other values ​​involved in the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> But &amp;quot;in society, he said, there are tags and constraints.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist health law Margaret Somerville also expressed &amp;quot;strong opposition&amp;quot; to the conclusions of the report, she called a &amp;quot;clear pro-euthanasia&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, denies in particular the report data regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy Policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts should prevail over dogma </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If it is a subject that can not be treated from short-term considerations or under the &amp;quot;emotion is good energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of &amp;quot;electricity directly affect the purchasing power and business competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is a healthy electoral appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the importance they attach to the nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be fruitful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinions on objective facts, data rational. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion &amp;quot;human beings on the planet, the&amp;quot; demographic change will result in a doubling of demand &amp;quot;electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a large part of the global population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will offset the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce &amp;quot;permanent electricity, not to mention the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, a subject disappeared the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident at Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case of Belgium, who submits his to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, which just means that no longer build new generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few , continue their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, they have decided after Fukushima to add one to their fleet by taking over the construction of a power cut after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will result in the rising price of &amp;quot;electricity, energy dependency aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas plants and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Within months, all these untoward effects are already felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to meditate. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion in the &amp;quot;wind, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind, on what basis, emissions CO2 and the price of electricity are respectively 65% ​​and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a bill &amp;quot;electricity 40% higher than that of French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a global economy the cost of &amp;quot;energy is a key factor in competitiveness and guarantee the maintenance of industrial facilities in the national territory, French companies benefit from the&amp;quot; cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would generate a spike in the price of &amp;quot;electricity, which would render illusory the rhetoric of re-industrialization of our country and defend the purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any principled opposition to this energy, the polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Recall that the energy policy of our country has built an industrial network of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> High export, it leads a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative job can not be relocated. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France were to agree to phase out nuclear power, would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing to a trickle the 6 billion of annual exports of French &amp;quot;nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electrician would command a PRT designed to work sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the &amp;quot;energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production&amp;quot; miracle power, nor does it exist diabolical. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Development by Areva of low-CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewable, reflects the complementary sources of &amp;quot;energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For nuclear, maintain the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a safety authority that has control uncompromising and transparent as existing plants on the Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our team, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Single, Three Mile Island occurred under conditions of normal operation, it has had no significant environmental or human. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl, the reactor design and human unforgivable sins have caused the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Result of this approach and cooperation between regulators, operators and builders French and German, the EPR has a design making it capable of withstanding such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While it is considered by all electricians who wish to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to competitors Areva and EDF in their opening the way to seize the leadership in The best of nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the &amp;quot;emotion, dogma and maneuvers dominate partisan debate as crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a one-time or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Policy on immigration conducted by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles-congestion of police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy number, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &amp;quot;countries of human rights &amp;quot;France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, the administrative harassment which are the subject of international students has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (see Libération, 23 May) proclaiming the way that France &amp;quot;does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waiters. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is rarely analyzed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is there on this subject a fairly broad consensus between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that &amp;quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers&amp;quot;, and left, explaining that by Michel Rocard of France &amp;quot; can not accommodate all the misery of the world &amp;quot;in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers were divided left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the degree of generosity that we deign to grant vis-à-vis immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its program, Francois Hollande is confined to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our &amp;quot;migration problem&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of ​​immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps pay electorally, but it is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As recalled by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizes the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.). There is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restrict immigration anemia affects growth and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Fears vis-à-vis the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace the native workers, especially low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers, performing essentially trades shortages in sectors of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants work in industries that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow employment opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country that has a shortage of anesthetists, the complementarities between national and migrant are that arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals . </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages over time. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants among the naturalized American Nobel Prize, Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years provide a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of € 150,000 to government budget averaged over the whole of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy would, at the start of term, get the missing points of growth &amp;quot;with teeth&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, is to think of European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious commodity, it is also a very fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented in Athens there are over two thousand years, has experienced throughout the twentieth century tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some have thought he would, for democracy to triumph permanently of his enemies, to exercise the vote, and exercise the most direct way possible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We have known since Napoleon &amp;quot;the Little,&amp;quot; that this was an easy mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be &amp;quot;instrument of oppression&amp;quot; as the philosopher once said Etienne Vacherot Republican. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, an education, the Enlightenment, of economic solidarity and social justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis of Europe we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally and primarily a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The recantation of true-false referendum Greek will have had in this regard revealing double value: that of the need for a return of political power, but also the unsettling feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle to move today, and that for many of them, Republican soldiers no longer pull in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums, held at the discretion of the necessities and piecemeal. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank check or a European absolute monarch jump feet first into the empty nationalist withdrawal: what choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want to exercise but cleavers, common, of right, continuous and serene, choice and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we indeed can not stop where most &amp;quot;list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> This is the whole of Europe that folds to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, who suffers from impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> This is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but the whole of Europe slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to restore the sovereignty of the people steering the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because together, the Europeans will reduce the weight of their debts to free up markets and prepare the future by investing. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The crisis will involve decisions at European level that can not be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Having long fought the proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, now everybody wants the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Be. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think without political integration and more democratic, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new craze and a new deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new step in European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To the Republic in France, it took &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; Republican. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution in interest could not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson is still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a more integrated Europe economically. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be done by building a more democratic politically, a true European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To Europe, Europeans do. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Smart cards &amp;quot;contactless&amp;quot; generalize </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The living world of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate optimist. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 looks set to end on a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (credit card, phone with SIM card ...), more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The fastest-growing segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay public transport or pay for purchases simply by approaching the card reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, against 320 million a year earlier! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the overall market for smart cards (6,925,000 cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Long behind the Asia-Pacific, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 POS terminals accept. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings were modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But supermarkets are working extra hard. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has issued this year and 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards Pass. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To move up a gear, it is necessary that banks now equip their customers. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &amp;quot;Two big French institutions are committed to the future to systematically disseminate to their customers credit cards equipped for contactless,&amp;quot; Gerard announced Nébouy, Visa Europe CEO France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> The banks are testing mobile payment </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary to complete transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &amp;quot;They have fallen behind.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &amp;quot;But they should finally see a boom next year.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &amp;quot;We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,&amp;quot; said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But banks are taking the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Credit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next at Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a holster allowing contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday preparing to market an offering that allows customers to pay with their mobile contactless. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Suspected of longstanding ties between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now &amp;quot;is satisfied&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &amp;quot;The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,&amp;quot; he said without elaborating. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to do a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two French nationals in Niger in January would have uncovered walkways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM, Anthony and Vincent Delory Léocour should be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had found several phone chips belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Axis terrorist </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis directs calls made to several parties based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, home of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says close of AQIM and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &amp;quot;This is an advanced but it should probably wait for evidence before speaking more formal operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s possible.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &amp;quot;We know for years that the sect has financial backing and intellectuals outside and she shows more and more active,&amp;quot; Kunle Amuwo tempers, a Nigerian scientist. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months these &amp;quot;support&amp;quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution of speech and Boko Haram or its procedures, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and same bill as those used by AQIM. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, has since lobbied for Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group as a community of enlightened bit of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Rapid success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa &amp;quot;Western education is a sin&amp;quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> She became politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while his supporters agree the fight against the central government impious. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The purpose of these first churches, bars, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, activists of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying the attacks against police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> Abuja is the reaction, as usual, without nuance. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army is back in town, there were 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, stopped living, is killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Hence the sect will be radicalized and leave its strongholds in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Last Christmas, she claims that an attack is 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police headquarters secured in a suicide attack, his first. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local UN headquarters will be his first international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa who would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through the Nigeria worries now all security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, as Somali al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, in an interview with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready &amp;quot;to share all information.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The World According to Republican candidates for the presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and rival of simplicity and ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis can she handle a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other multiply thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - fuse. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the best position in the race for the nomination of the &amp;quot;Grand Old Party&amp;quot;, has threatened to take the Chinese at the WTO and put into question &amp;quot;for manipulating their currency,&amp;quot; a central theme in an exasperated American by migration of large segments of its industry to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Too bad if this means triggering a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China and Obama&amp;#39;s only candidate to have a vision of foreign policy sophistication, almost choked against an attitude that &amp;quot;flatter&amp;quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He called for a constructive dialogue with Beijing but muscular (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which stagnates in the deep surveys, remains inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Like Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &amp;quot;If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he brags.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &amp;quot;If Obama is elected, they will bomb.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations vis-à-vis the partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows a disregard for his embarrassing record. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing &amp;quot;is trying to develop a nuclear capability&amp;quot; - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964! </seg>
<seg id="2848"> Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants of strikes against Iran, says he is ready, in turn, to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents counter that the current President Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to put water in his wine Anti-Terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist, rightly, on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, his departure too precipitous &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; from Iraq, his dithering on Libya, and a sticky label him as weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attack is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The people judge rather positive assessment of Obama&amp;#39;s national security, which eliminated Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> From Iraq, she is wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, arguing that we must rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama strikes more just. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new door NTRY of Russian gas to Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> Nord Stream, directly linking Western Europe to Russia via the Baltic seabed, entered service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must deliver gas to the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Over 500 guests including four heads of state and government attended last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and buffet end, the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects, under the sea Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte the wheel turned all the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas in the Western European network . </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each additional year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube should be completed in late 2012, allowing delivery of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And we already mentioned the possibility of constructing a third over the same course. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion in a timely fashion of this massive project feels like a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltics. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream will indeed help deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> As a result, both countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a &amp;quot;new Hitler-Stalin Pact,&amp;quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means if the subject is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The Western Europe, by providing support to the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But what is the price of a weakening of Europe&amp;#39;s energy, since the project has created a rift between East Europeans and West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has, in just five years, the triumph of his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &amp;quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, he is a new artery that binds us together organically,&amp;quot; Fillon confirmed by opening the pipeline, demonstrating how large gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in large numbers to Lubmin, the point of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The tube is underwater steel-wrapped concrete to protect against the anchors of ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it, he had to avoid minefields dating from World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &amp;quot;A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&amp;quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> He also took more measures to protect flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupts its entire length: no valve or station maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A platform was laid off control of Sweden, but the project gave it up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company to settle permanently off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &amp;quot;In case of damage, we stop the flow of gas in less than a minute,&amp;quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> If a leak, the gas in the pipeline then escapes into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who provided the welds to find a leak every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Monitoring the status of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, towed by a ship, for external observation, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Of the form of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to work fifty years without suffering any repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gas flow is simply ensured by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bar at the start, and 100 on arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces for this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Gazprom remains the leader, who keeps 51% of shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> There are attached the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then leased to this company for twenty years renewable, the total transport capacity of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &amp;quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,&amp;quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline was assured by the shareholders 30% and 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment totaled 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are sure to recover their costs, since only Gazprom bears the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline with pine trees. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valve, 4.5 meters high, form the exit gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature and specific gas happens, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines. </seg>

<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a book mark. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> In existence for fifteen years by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the interest in writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has a scent of adventure, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its rectangular black cover, its elastic, the leaves of a white color, as weathered by time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Yet the Moleskine as we know it today was born ... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, at the time decided to launch a notebook design but Distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book draws on an ancient technique of production, mole skin (moleskin) which means a coating used to cover cotton benches for example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of book was very popular with writers and travelers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &amp;quot;Moleskine has revived one day be old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century,&amp;quot; says Maria Sebregondi, now the Brand Manager at Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is there. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased 26% to $ 12.7 million pieces passed. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> We are far from the production of confidential early years, when only 3,000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to draw a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook perfect for both the businessman that students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Like the Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception in today has nearly 100 since 2008 and has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in bookstores, the Fnac small shops downtown and proved his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &amp;quot;We followed the times and this new requirement of writing, despite the rise of e-mails,&amp;quot; said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This signature accompanies the development of cultural Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibit &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot; where architects and artists exhibit their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, she also initiated coverage Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of his success and the cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer covers ... The brand is available on a variety of media. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that is the envy: the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, Syntegra Capital today, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate of disabled workers is he so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive public policy implementation in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still two times higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the entire population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &amp;quot;No, said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of disabled.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &amp;quot;The progress made over the last fifteen years are considerable.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &amp;quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &amp;quot;There still remains much to do.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> I must say that for unemployed disabled people, many obstacles remain before accessing employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% did not and the tray of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, many criteria that complication in the re-employment, and that &amp;quot;the crux of the problem&amp;quot;, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the brakes objectives. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remains unsaid, changing attitudes, of course, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Enterprise for the City indicated that the managers surveyed have &amp;quot;a low level of knowledge of disability&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;over-representation of persons in wheelchairs, impaired mental or intellectual.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result, private companies over 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law ... In 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest available figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &amp;quot;We are now around 3%,&amp;quot; said Peter White, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from businesses that do not respect this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Proof: the number of establishments &amp;quot;taxed&amp;quot;, as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &amp;quot;The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies, says Peter White.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &amp;quot;But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially in large groups.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the ministry of employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &amp;quot;What happiness&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (8:45 p.m.) and Eden Hazard Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they get from this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We will not write up that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the platform of the auditorium at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard has indeed made peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the procedure mood striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but good things to say about it. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &amp;quot;I feel much happier Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &amp;quot;I want to move forward,&amp;quot; says his side Lille. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As for its services has contrasting between club and country, &amp;quot;this is a whole, is it justified.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &amp;quot;In Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &amp;quot;I must take my bearings.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Struck against Romania on Friday night for the match against France, Hazard comes to St. Denis finally &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Not to mention, however, the notion of &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> The Blues, he encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &amp;quot;I was always endure,&amp;quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Inevitably, this helps further strengthen the character &amp;quot;particularly&amp;quot; the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Especially that face, &amp;quot;there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),&amp;quot; he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &amp;quot;It has crossed just now.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &amp;quot;Being able to play against them, this is happiness!&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Good-naturedly, Leekens for his part spoke of &amp;quot;pride&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &amp;quot;Pride&amp;quot; to play &amp;quot;an exhibition match.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &amp;quot;Pride&amp;quot; also shows, as a &amp;quot;neighbor&amp;quot; - that France is &amp;quot;once again a team of high level&amp;quot; a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &amp;quot;Laurent Blanc did a great job of thunder,&amp;quot; he was thrilled. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be willing to share the plane with the Blues management ... Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &amp;quot;Our little Belgians get big,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re trying to build something, players are ambitious, they are hungry.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &amp;quot;You will report back at the next games.&amp;quot; Included one against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal is very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> Portugal&amp;#39;s Paulo Bento began with great optimism the playoff against Bosnia (2200), in Lisbon on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> On the way, both teams had been unrealistic. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &amp;quot;At the end of 90 minutes, a team we will be happy and, above all, a happy country.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento sees already, in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecção, which is at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debunk. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Given the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears obvious that games are not made. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, certainly, but he was unable to score that goal so precious, that would have relieved. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &amp;quot;This is a good result, which has nevertheless a certain risk because we did not score away goal&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in their bright Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese were convinced to move to an audience that should be there too hot, even if the party looks obviously &amp;quot;very close&amp;quot;, says an optimistic Bento but lucid . </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &amp;quot;We expect a close game, but we are quite convinced that they can take over,&amp;quot; said the Portuguese coach of 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &amp;quot;We continue to have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,&amp;quot; even when relativized&amp;#39;s successor Carlos Queiroz. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The draw on Friday the Portuguese forces in Bosnia to score and win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> A draw may be enough to Bosnians, who also need to score. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &amp;quot;This is a good result, which has nevertheless a certain risk because we did not score away goal,&amp;quot; laments Bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &amp;quot;We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has a lot of players with individual qualities,&amp;quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese have the intention to input a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &amp;quot;not give them time to think.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, provided to be realistic this time. </seg>
