<seg id="2"> The Ukraine Parliament has today rejected the proposal of repealing the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code which condemns opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The amendment would open the way to the release of the former Minister, but members of Parliament rejected the proposal to reduce sentences for economic crimes in the second reading. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not yet firm, the Court of appeal is obliged to review in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West raised doubts about the impartiality of the tribunal. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The victory of Libya </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan revolt, already has its losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried at a secret location in the wilderness and without it there is no war. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It remains to define who is the winner </seg>
<seg id="13"> As it is already usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it&apos;s whether it&apos;s moderate or radical </seg>
<seg id="14"> The National Transitional Council has made entry into force of the customary law, the Sharia, which already to some extent we know. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves on cut off the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women may be forgetting emancipated and apostates waiting for his execution and so on. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Rather than by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warlike tribes, is to join by the Koran. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An order that not us can even imagine, and that certainly cannot be established in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, our way of life is not neither the only nor objectively the better and probably them should not, on the other hand, the aforementioned Libyans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The truth is no longer surprising that Islamic combatants accept grateful the help of unfaithful dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks not headed them an American general, but great Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When winners are looking for in Libya, West is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We are caught in a gunfight which serve the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without that there are guarantees for profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, not we occupy Libya militarily. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this case, the premises in them is not a problem expelling the &quot;Crusaders&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> But, without occupation does get oil companies done with Libyan black gold only with good words? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is quite possible, but it may be that West can finally boast of protecting human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Provided that the followers of the sharia does not cross us. </seg>

<seg id="83"> In the families of overweight children there is no habit of sports, which applies to the majority of current families, where only 15% of children responded that his parents, at least once per week, find time for physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey carried out for 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of basic education in the whole Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was already the second edition of the program of &quot;obesity of is no accident&quot;, which supports the General health insurance company and the Unilever company. </seg>
<seg id="87"> So far, they have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children from 4th through 8th grade. </seg>

<seg id="90"> No breakfast but with sausage for dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are important, in addition, the details, which have also, as for example have one fixed hour for breakfast in family. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the families of school respondents at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the majority of families, each breakfast only. </seg>
<seg id="94"> But the worst was discovering that in the 10% of households not breakfast nothing. </seg>
<seg id="95"> However, breakfast is the basis of a correct diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The study shows that unhealthy French fries are consumed much more frequently in families of obese children. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost all - drinking regardless of the weight - daily sweet soft drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> As a rule make sport more than 40 per cent of children surveyed, however, enter their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Fabricar you your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> The next phase of the study it was possible that the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) is create their own diets from all possible bids according to their tastes and opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Their favorite foods include pasta, meat and sweets </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Especially alarming is the popularity of sweet soft drinks&quot;, he warns in the final report of the study. </seg>
<seg id="104"> As a main meal pasta takes the cake and is closely followed by poultry meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Practically, the children always reject the legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Change to healthy habits </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the control group of participants in the study, they filled the questionnaire after finishing prevention programme&quot;obesity is not a coincidence,&quot;was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating&quot;, is aimed on the results of the study. </seg>
<seg id="109"> It draws attention, for example, as regards the sweet drinks, where many children begin to prefer ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children would also elect most frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The stylist has to be also a good psychologist, claim professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article, learn how the stylists, already I complained a little that the initial lessons were already pretty loaded. </seg>
<seg id="113"> He had no clue how things would go. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress to problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectacle. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us </seg>
<seg id="117"> And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, already have a PIN. </seg>
<seg id="118"> We are after we have studied with the Director, Alena, (the course there no no man) on how to dress to the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And that&apos;s the vast majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized without appropriate curves figure and someone suffers overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The stylist will know optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves </seg>
<seg id="122"> We have been given some tips on how to highlight the body of women from the type of Jennifer Lopez, of enormous hips and breasts but waist close and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it&apos;s worth making sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly will not regret, because the clothes that feel perfectly is priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a skirt to measure will feel much better than one that does not stop moving, get up, danced in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The stylized body can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draping. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are certainly many types of miscellaneous and bodies, so I&apos;m glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, which is to design two dressing rooms: one for day and one for night. </seg>
<seg id="130"> It should take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that fits the person in question. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Touched me &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps her know of the Victoria&apos;s Secret campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Cry inside, for me is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, will have lately gained a few hundred kilos (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The dresses have to cut from magazines or find them online and print them, then develop them graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, which is how he refers to the entire result expresses also our personal style and our relationship with graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is important to also think about the graphic part of the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist, therefore not wears only physically, but it also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But all this is already for Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The stylist should have a global vision. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three invited experts encouraged the Conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The stylist Honza Pokorný, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and photographer of fashion Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know you take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a good stylist knows to handle a same garment in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> In this case, the variability is essential. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Thus, such the gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) to Classic you can dress with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with high-heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Either just her sleeves and go up the neck to get a completely different picture. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play this&quot;, he insisted us. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What I value most is the next tip: &quot;to start working, we need to first know all rules&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then already you can break them&quot;, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I clear why memorizamos all these formulas, what combines with what, why, if it then turns out that the fashion magazines we find different results. </seg>
<seg id="151"> That is not to mention the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know a stylist must have more clothing types in the reserve which aims to photograph. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Thus, for a history of fashion that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), should be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And it pictures the clothes works in combination with other items, all of them are different from the ones used in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> All this should be taken into account when designing the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear tendency to use the services of stylists. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Until the celebrities also find him useless (I suffice my skills, my physical appearance is not as important). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when someone asked to our services, must take into account that it is likely to indicate a very different to his size (smaller) Royal. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then just guglear and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained/lost, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us that the stylist will not suffice to focus in fashion, but you have to understand outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During his work, especially is you should contact the people that dress, so it is essential to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Known value to people, it is not less, defends his views. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a Director hires you so you clasifiquéis him the costume and completéis it with nice clothes, not can pick up and throw all that was and say:&quot; huy what horror &quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Found at least one couple of things that you can assess and recommend so that someone can get to them&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called &quot;placovka&quot;, i.e. the job board. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is set around the waist and there are all the necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="169"> They are objects such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There are also thread nylon (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as handbags or hats), clamps Special insert of clothing ahead, if this is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the tissue), or a set of sewing. </seg>
<seg id="170"> In order not to remain passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to take the bottom of the shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the photo shoots in the Studio, on a flat surface, could damage the sole and much more even abroad. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And we did more than take and take. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not touch the shoes with the scissors to avoid damaging them by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So it had to be very skilled. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that those skills fail me very well. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small part of all those who have heard during all the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I&apos;ve already noticed account devote myself to the styling at the professional level is not a way of rose, but I&apos;m just like what people say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: The Run competes for America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> A journey in carefree principle is complicated because of a series of oversights improper from a routine trip during the morning shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> To some extent managed to cover the expectations, but this does not help, if, in fact, not intended to do anything extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new awards, to which the title adds The Run, it aroused high expectations already before its premiere. </seg>
<seg id="184"> It promised that it would give new airs old series of races Need for Speed and as a result displayed, appears as a game that should end up failing again a genus of action without further. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We are also curious to know how would be the inserted scenes, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his own foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much with respect to what we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are races that may occur by acceptable, but in total computation lose points because of absurd rulings, which come already appearing in the series for years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Actually no one can not call errors, but it is rather incomprehensible unwillingness of programmers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure starts very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You entered a story whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sentáis at the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach the first New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer something interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten stages, and then, in more than fifty races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It follows that each race takes place by a different route and stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Thus, one does not have remotely the feeling that the game offers always the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are even pleasant view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous installments of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore, it is nothing out of this world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the walk through the desert, autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect. </seg>
<seg id="199"> In addition, races diversify from time to time by an unusual element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Thus, for example, in the desert you you are a storm of sand which reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Instead, in the mountains should be careful so that it not sepulte you an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> According to this, each of the races is very well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There are only a couple of models, but this is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a moment, you intentáis forward to a required amount of rivals (normal in a classic race), then treat gain time (timed classic duel) and it then awaits a duel against a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In the midst of all this appears sometimes police, which does not only make things even more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Novelty are the landscapes outside the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Interactive animations occur when Jack, in the majority of cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few less landscapes in the game would be expected (in particular, there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That means that today it is no longer very much, but it cannot be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you are you looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But for a race designed with enough action is quite this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, everything in order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But problems arise after some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the correctness of the models of conduction, no longer the case same with collisions. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Games of this type cannot be expected that you recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a coup against any object, you can not predict how react to your car, so not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is typical that, to make a tight overtaking or move the car with normal traffic, there is only light friction, but in other nearly identical situations, your car ends up doing pirouettes uncontrolled. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even just totally destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to a system reset, no big problems arise, but you can put you in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The resets are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or you log out of the track, the game restores you to the last point of rescue in the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> However, in each race only are five available resets. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So therefore it is not more than help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very reliable. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, or reset help, only aid the learning of the given stage of memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> One big drawback of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves, for example, should enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Other times you are somewhere &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles always with the same settings, although you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This makes but rage impotently in situations, when you see that two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent anticipates no problems, but when you get, you must rotate either curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is equal when arrive, because it is programmed by the &quot;surprise&quot; will always happen in front of your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents have also one advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During the entire game shall sites where, without taking into account the time, always you brought forward the same opponent on the same site. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This also occurs at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Your opponent must come before you, for a price that is. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When you are in front of you, the vision of the cars that come from the front, so the car can do porridge at the beginning difficult it. </seg>
<seg id="237"> The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline can be understood, but the execution is so apparent that you surely disappointed immediately. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a pity, because although the journey model is simple, the game is fun and action, so that often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens or where. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And really gives equal, if merit is the idea with 50 exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that there be no boredom, or anything else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the change of cars during races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You have to be attentive to the suppliers of gasoline next to the road, because precisely there you have to change car, although in the vast majority of cases you just what you have. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports are suitable for urban areas, the strong American cars for the straight highways and the exotic Supercars for technical driving, e.g. curves mountain roads. </seg>
<seg id="244"> In addition main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, i.e. There are races in specific locations which you know by the stories. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here desire not only medals but also experience points to your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the tales. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To achieve the higher level, the driver open you several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> At the same time, there is connected an Autolog feature online, compare your results with other players and disponibiliza other community functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the more difficult to understand elements is how the last race in history is made. </seg>
<seg id="249"> With the car you get to the tunnel of metro (pass), where you put to run in the dark by tracks (pass). </seg>
<seg id="250"> The speedometer you marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind the convoy of the metro you arrives and gets you ahead without more. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In drafting surely we will have a discussion about this for several days, on whether during the programming of the game none even a little thought or the authors of truth we take by a bunch of bobos. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side of the game isn&apos;t anything special, but at least the General Visual effects are in the most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What so bad that, reduces the quality of image and, occasionally, in a serious way in the most tense moments. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This applies above all to accidents where there are involved many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> So that is the pleasure the greater part of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each of his father and his mother&quot;, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game avoid absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have problems in asserting that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> It gives the feeling that the game is not completed. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Fun is guaranteed, but prepare yourselves because errors you golpearán in the eyes with the strength of a few airport reflectors. </seg>

<seg id="276"> Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptic. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;Did not expect me to mount a war without quarter&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;Last five, six years, before the situation is stabilised a little, be calm and new players to adjust to their new roles&quot;, thus began with conviction their Conference at the Faculty of law the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How does not take seriously its motto &quot;clear and openly on Europe,&quot; he said already in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of law of the u. Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also approved the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;First thing arise criticisms if it is bland, an official grey, able to assume any role, but I have to say that it left all baffled, because it assumed their roles to perfection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a man who knows how to listen to the 27 States members, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU must go&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new post of representative of the foreign policy and security can be explained from the question: &quot;Who is this EU?&quot; What number can I call her? &quot;.&quot; It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarifying of political Union with regard to States such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to ban us cheese of Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda was, remains and will continue to the European Council in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency for two years was a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czech Republic dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the crisis of gas and organized a Summit for the Eastern partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the Government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the Ambassador: &quot;a fuss good&quot;, not just the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now trying to. </seg>
<seg id="293"> On the other hand, should approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Ambassador also recalled their main slogans, with those who came to Europe: &quot;On Europe clear&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;The truth is that I do not like ugly abbreviations, the foreign words or jargon that people don&apos;t understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;How can a citizen understand that in Brussels not be invented really cucumbers cucumbers curved or rounded, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to prohibit Olomouc cheese?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It also seeks to capitalize on the environment of the EU and closer to more Czech citizens to the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe speeds awaits us </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Euro-sceptics and people see more negatives than positives. </seg>
<seg id="301"> In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czech Republic in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Blame it on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he emphasized the strength and the collaboration of the Visegrad Group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me that when come to me a Polish and a Hungarian and gets me a Slovak, a French beside me tells me:&quot; what, already have been those of the Visegrad Group? &quot;, and you see that it does no grace&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, to the EU, according to Vicenová, they await new harsh policy of budgetary policy for the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Feels like something very real the concept of two speeds, if they are not more in Europe, rather than the new &quot;European Federation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have in the eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area and also the procedure for enhanced cooperation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;He said for the first time that cooperate only countries who want to and which not, staying outside&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of two speeds,&quot; expected Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed between the Member States, not only among the members of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone looked for a term to define accurately the strategy of IBM, the approximate would be &quot;long term&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, already been 100 years since its foundation. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this far-sighted nature was the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas j. Watson Mr </seg>
<seg id="317"> He already coined the slogan that the world&apos;s many problems have solutions if people are willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Their motto &quot;Think!&quot; became their record label, surrounding by which the life of the future will be building giant (was also the title of an internal review which IBM began publishing in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us, IBM means a long-term thinking, a continuous motion towards the future.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and thrived for years hundred for that reason, because stayed faithful to its basic principles, but without fear to the changes around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That enabled us, in our first century, transforming the technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> &quot;We hope to prosper even more in our second century,&quot; he said during its anniversary, the current director of the Samuel j. Palmisano company. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, already in the 1930s, worried about caring for their employees as the employer of Baťa in Czech Republic (IBM employees were the first American workers enjoyed holidays with pay, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewarded the best inventors and vendors.) </seg>
<seg id="326"> The same sophistication long-term keeps IBM in the relationship with the client. </seg>
<seg id="327"> From the beginning the company knew discover talents (being one of the first world companies to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could be chosen without any problems). </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with the strategy anti-discrimination is the current plan of IBM, replaced it a woman next year that Palmisano: Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It has been already working thirty years at IBM, where he was head of sales, márquetin and strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, brainstorm online, which gives rise to plenty of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that they pantry ideas, because almost half a million people work in the firm. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The fixed business position provides the company a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM remained a concept of institution rather than technological company&quot;, says the Economist, Harvard Business School Professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology,&quot; says George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and create a business directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;great green&quot; - as it is known in the United States.UU. family because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is possibly the most versatile technological company (develops equipment, programs, infrastructure and services web hosting within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology). </seg>
<seg id="339"> It boasts the largest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> His inventions include the automatic teller machine, payment cards, the swap, barcodes and floppy disks. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM will billed this year $ 220 billion. This year has become the second signature technology by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking to the future </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of the customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, OS/2, services on line Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers). </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If your business is based in advance, not can anchor itself emotionally in the past&quot;, recognized Samuel j. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Why IBM has no problems to build bases in other platforms (and equally, if doesn&apos;t work, leaves them). </seg>
<seg id="346"> And that is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and falls exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Technology of the future </seg>
<seg id="348"> In terms of sales, IBM focuses especially on services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of teams. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However, even in 1990 teams accounted for over half of the providers fee. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $ 15 billion. During in the same period, has spent 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time expressed the modern global financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas j. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 increased investments. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It seems that so far the company IBM has managed to weather the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase. </seg>
<seg id="355"> IBM is changing it all, except for its value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant aguantará. </seg>
<seg id="357"> History of IBM: from cheeses to spaceflight cutting machine </seg>
<seg id="358"> IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City for a hundred years, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The IBM name was adopted because in 1924 - originally was a brand used in branches of Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the late 1880s. </seg>
<seg id="361"> He owned inventions such as the famous &quot;punch clock&quot;, which allows to control the entry and exit of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint moved to the head of a company of the competition, Thomas j. Watson, that assist it with the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the strong basis on which underlying corporate culture and identity). </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until the year 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as indicated by its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business from cutters meat and cheese to cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years that Watson led the company, turnover doubled in $ 9 million and began the great expansion of the company across the continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was crucial for the company which, after almost forty years occupying the Chair of the Chief, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s the staff and IBM computers helped NASA guiding flights into space (mercury, Saturno and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon). </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classic &quot;PCs&quot;, which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consultancy company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a full advice and high value-added services. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e. &quot;a smarter planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its aim is to make more rational technology use, though areas have not yet been planned nor the circumstances, for example, as regards transport and administration of cities has been improved. </seg>
<seg id="376"> For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; platform that helps retailers manage the complete commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a long history in this country. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Already in 1932 opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country that the took in the Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today here, the IBM ČR operates also the strategic Center of outsourcing in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. There is also here a research team of world-renowned works with speech recognition. </seg>

<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer to Bartošové in his house, I couldn&apos;t even imagine how would end his marriage. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Despite the request, Iveta not had moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> He even publicly declared that he loved her. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted the relationship between her husband and even dismissed him forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychytář not care you with who lie on his wife. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If a day Rychtář broke through with Bartošová, his wife not expect it at home with open arms. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;He is the biological father of my children, and if you want to live the rest of his life in our House, no one will miss&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;But here no longer live as my dear old donkey who was wrong, but as a man that I join certain ties,&quot; said Rychtářová and added that it had already desenganchado her husband and insisted only on mutual respect. </seg>

<seg id="403"> &quot;I know that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and assume full responsibility,&quot; concludes Josef. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: also refer to you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men who are able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them appoint them without thinking. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dear women, you recognize in the following lines, where certain female vices that manage to boil the blood males are cited? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Shopping </seg>
<seg id="408"> Do it reproaches you his Orange media have procurement unit? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Do you have to buy at least a washcloth in week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Do you like buying often the sales? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then in your case is that shopping has become a habit. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are given account that should appease his passion for shopping, at least a little. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But let&apos;s see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more by the clothing stores, find well fitting clothes and then prove it them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Although for the majority of women shopping is a national pastime, for men it can become almost a hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Just remember how many times already has told his partner that it the best wait in front of the door. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;Not am I too fat?&quot; </seg>

<seg id="419"> &quot;Do really you I liked?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Do not sound you these phrases? </seg>
<seg id="421"> A Yes? </seg>

<seg id="436"> Naturally. You don&apos;t want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order. </seg>

<seg id="438"> Slander and gossip </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women are also going the slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone. </seg>

<seg id="442"> With hand on heart, that is typical of almost all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> On the other hand, there are avaricious women of those who do not control, those that love chismorrear do often, despise all and are dangerous to those who surround them, especially in a women&apos;s employment team. </seg>

<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes seem to ambushes,&quot; explained Jágr, once his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, following the first trallazo of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech track. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček was made with the disc behind the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got goal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically by Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> After collaborating with Jágr got the third goal when his shot colase by the fourth goal from Wayne Simmonds. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I don&apos;t mean to be the best player on the pitch, but certainly is among the top three,&quot; he approved Jágr to their parent. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;Never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I&apos;m very satisfied of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All these years in the NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and that now produces results,&quot; adds Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina still became the party a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, of penalty, to reach a goal from distance. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read not allowed more complications, although they eventually outnumbered in number two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger had a good performance in our field.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;It cleared the disk, I took speed and Read was the farthest side.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to hit him to the disk and I am happy because I got,&quot; he described Voráček the last goal of the match as he lived. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the top of the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third retired due to an injury in the upper body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Canadiens not only lost a player with much experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2: 3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shootings. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points local coach he deplored the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;That&apos;s bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We play the game alone with a veteran player, the rest were newcomers. </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;Anyway, but is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with this&quot;, said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Both rotate players turned against us, we could not resist&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had to simplify more still the game, remove the disc of our field.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;And thus leave gaps,&quot; explained one of the defenses, p. k. Subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Ondřej Pavelec goalkeeper contributed thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the 5: 2 on Tampa Bay victory. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Goals from Jets were marked by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five matches. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have travel prices evolved since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 in then Czechoslovakia had only five State travel agents authorised: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The time travel agencies sold travel only to the Socialist bloc, in the majority of cases because travel to the West were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists would, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Crimea on the Black Sea Sochi) Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when he could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime moved westward and the Czech tourists trips were then quite restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialism was the fact to the citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also to the Checoeslovacos) not be enabling them travel free and individually even in the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual trip was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies offered in those days also travel West, but one should be at the tail with a sack of sleep and thus spend all night, or have &quot;good friends&quot; in the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Yet all was not won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the &quot;people politically unreliable&quot;, so could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not a currency freely convertible and without guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain (the Western currency) resources to travel to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The vast majority of the Czechs spent your holidays in their own country, so it had a large number of cottages and summer homes, the Czechs were acquiring. This custom still persists. </seg>
<seg id="493"> How to travel from the Czech Republic has suffered since 1989 a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 for us was not more will spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs took 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It is nna great paradox that today day are no longer aware, the fact that to the destination currently favorite, Croatia, until 1989 not you could travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Early 1990s won exemption from visa to travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of visits of short duration, especially to Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, for a long time, were not had enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at the least for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris sleeping groups of Czechs in the parks in tents, that our income then do not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the Czechs at the time was the take with you the food (canned foods, sausages, etc.) to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech Crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living increased and with it also the average wages, around 1997 causing an increase in demand for travel. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increase in demand for travel began agencies, from 1997 on a regular basis, prepare travel using Charter flights connections, what did incredibly lower travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90s of the last century, already the Czechs traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except United States.UU., which further simplified our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism already happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Depart every year from that year, direct Charter flights with Czech tourists was hot and distant countries. This winter is already directly flies from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic countries currently visiting about 100 thousand Czechs per year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment of this era, that symbolizes our development post-revolution, arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008, EE.UU. It eliminated visas for Czech visitors, with what our country came to be among the more developed countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent in travel abroad more than 15 thousand Czech Crowns per head, including expenditure on the site of stay. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Convened General ordinary Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again at a dead. </seg>
<seg id="511"> For almost five months the Czech football is without President and likely successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Federation of football (FAČR), will not become known or following the call of the next extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Poděbrady. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Indeed, it has yet to agree on voting rules to follow. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without them, you shall not vote even to choose between the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Stakeholders to preside over the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned in June but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person that knew to deal with football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, unleashed a controversy between the two federations of the Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This became clear on September 16 when he had to be elected the new President. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in Prague&apos;s Smichov district, because the talks had blocked and not only with regard to the method of choice. </seg>
<seg id="519"> It was not reached any consensus or who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that time and because of this single point, was a partial agreement, also backed the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> However, disputes over the electoral code remains open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> More light on the situation could shed or the Executive Committee which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinion about the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: for how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute revolves around whether is should proceed according to the statutes or find another model&quot;, said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, from the direction of the Association, which represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win that candidate who has highest percentage of support in the Federation which shall submit his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The region of Moravia is ready to reach a compromise that can win the candidate with a greater total share of votes in both federations. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have at least two-thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;This take away you, however, the sense of two previous rounds and would deny altogether the concept of bicameral system&quot;, that is how Svoboda understood the objections of the Moravian part, according to which it would be best not to touch the agenda and vote according to the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With that said, surprisingly, it is agreement also Tomaš Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates more suits Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I would like to that you vote to the maximum according to the statutes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;To not be invent any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly&quot;, says the owner of Victoria Plzen, postulated for the first time as a candidate and which mainly addressed its observations against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Peltarion remains upbeat. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him, in Poděbrady this will decide on the new President, and he believes that candidates in the future cooperate constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions apaciguarán with the party today of our national team in the European Championship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will be protagonist and thus cooperate more to taste&quot; says the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates have more experience in management of football, both professional and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the most reluctant. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope that an agreement is reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It is not the conflict between Bohemian and Moravian, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may have as a result a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;Anyway, I hope that common sense will be imposed,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Already do not have much time to ensure that all parties reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can say until the start of the party if the football team will complete? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee to the place where qualifying match will take place. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Maybe the decisive meeting, could finally be which will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobeš, Minister of education, youth and sports, would like to much mainstream parties divided the more powerful the country&apos;s sports organization to ensure that it reaches an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the next Assembly General of the central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of sport (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport following the financial problems of the House of lotteries Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík will fight to reach the Presidency, because can&apos;t find a more suitable candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who prioritized all his ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or presented as a candidate for a post as relevant. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is a right person, I would be fighting for it and I would not present as a candidate for the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But until today no could be found a person as well,&quot; said Paclík to the Agency of Czech news (ČTK) </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the winning course of the elections, which opens the way to the Presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR). </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that, in case they win, he would remain in Office as President only until 2013, when come the turn of the ordinary general Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In that position you would like to see an expert and good Manager is not unrelated to football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have spoken with some people that could take into account&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me was crazy to hear some say at this time even they want to identify with the Czech football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change that view,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What supposedly more annoying to Paclík at this time is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional football of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a past controversial, known outside the scene as a powerful lobbyist with capacity of influencing the vote of the delegates in the general Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík it is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;Should he win, it would maintain the existing status and nothing in football will change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious business man, the football will draw even less advantage&quot;, said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what prestige football could bring the victory of Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And with what eyes we will look at UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, who also takes his earlier statement that &quot;sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta to become President&quot; with some caution. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case of winning the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Same opinion is another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first that would follow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;It is very capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I so could imagine, for example, as head of the representation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;but not as a manager of an association&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I put nor the nose where I am not able to,&quot; added Paclík, which in September raised much attention by support the suspension of the referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that it would manage the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Private enterprise management capabilities, used since last summer, it is also the Director of Pilsen, with its support may the triumph in first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have strength to change some things in the field of football and to contribute to its safe practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To reduce the influence of certain pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary Committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathies towards the President of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities would also be the consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key problems that the new President should be given.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If they were to increase taxes on gambling, as announced it the political parties, he would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where is all this money,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> In addition, Paclík now does not consider even its association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be &quot;non-partisan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Peltarion is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But see no sense to the fact hypocritically assign my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person then there again after a year and a half,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Peltarion promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the stalemate of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had a new Constitution that could definitively to resolve disputes regarding the electoral regulations in the future,. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about meeting this Thursday in Poděbrady, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of being elected, precisely in representation and in fund-raising. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general Assembly, so this delay of two months could go you either to defend and present their ideas on the management of football in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people at all levels focuses on football already for a long time and expects to know this Thursday to the new President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;Feel that it is time that someone manage the Association&quot;, thinks the man that is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that behind the current problems with elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, in the general Assembly of June were approved the statutes were not so perfect as everyone thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, have a President already since September,&quot; warned Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the civic association was used as a decoy to win delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If you elect me President, so I shall take as a personal challenge and am prepared to respond in the event that this fails.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a matter of principle, without which we can not exist,&quot; says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, in theory, try not to mess with his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Already in the past had been warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, which respected for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would be also his first Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Had already long been without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave puppet head. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It takes more than one year in the world of football, and it has already achieved some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Their attacks but they were shameful and many people was surprised by the electoral campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;So many of them doubt about his true character,&quot; he told his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the declarations already announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions until the higher. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The latter should be promotion of the football showcase. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Also it would solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption of the past year scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately after I involve in negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that enough money for all of football there is&quot;, said two months to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He then also promised that his appointment as President of the football would not result in personal modification of the template. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;Should first know the tasks of each employee,&quot; said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy reigns an understandable nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that predict before the next general Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain Thursday to Poděbrady. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, no doubt we will achieve overcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility, which will only recover if you finally have a leader&quot;, still two days before the most crucial day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working forward. </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as new President of the Association of Czech football, many people would be certainly embittered. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that, if elected, will work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> You want to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It also undertakes to solve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work initiated by the previous President Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President, I would like to devote myself completely to football&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of young footballers from high performance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;This not to say that you would all only&quot;, Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee in such way that each Member can devote to an area specified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I asignaré difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, push ahead with great momentum. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;A lot of people this probably not you like, because it will mean start work very hard and not only criticize the work of others&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, said that he had considered not to stand again as candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that this will be meaningless and that there will be people behind my me prevent and hinder at every turn&quot;, explained the reasons for his indecision. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people told me that I must give me up, because then they would give up also others&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It&apos;s having faith to not abandon, without more,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> As they say, it motivates also continue the work which began with Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;During these two years, was completed much of the work that I do not it is now lost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and not I like that someone stop them&quot;, concerned by the fact that, if they chose another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the Association could again be as it was before the time of Hašek announced. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him is especially all those people dealing with football to make only a privilege for a few chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;Was I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to make a football for all, because only in this way will feel well all and not only those who were elected,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It also rejects the idea that the President would only be Bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind do as much by Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division in a Czech part and another Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;No would be the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young Moravian players&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Although the struggle of the presidential election joined Tomaš Paclík, President of Club Pilsner, Rajchl no longer believe in their chances of being elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;Still feel have strong support from the Czech Federation, which I chose as his Vice-President and he knows that behind me there is clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, whose successes include the saving of a few tens of millions of crowns of disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the law of the lottery. </seg>

<seg id="647"> The most beautiful pools in Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> Jump blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> by Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, lavish baths in Budapest: who visits Europe can live his wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where the best welfare in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder made a journey of research during the year and half past, there was something that could not miss in his luggage, a bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back on the water, I looked at the art dome atop, swam towards the whole of marble, her waiting in line at the edge of the pool and wondered before the modernist indoor meticulously restored. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Liked the bathroom, he noted in his book to the time of all the interesting about the style details and history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in his recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete buildings&quot; in Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> He made his &quot;trip by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe&quot; by 13 countries: addition of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> This 46 years old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Don&apos;t want to have anything to do with the sport, says Meder, only the water is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It only bothered that the bathroom fans have to comply with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear the joyful trills of birds in the Park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be always so ugly&quot;, affirms this inhabitant of Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started collecting beautiful pools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of water doubles the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Splash in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great because addresses all the senses, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the Builder strives, the pools can be a real gift for the view: &quot;Instead of soil, the bathrooms have a surface of water.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All bends optically: the high vaults, color tiles, the trampolines. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The book with pictures on small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly makes you want to jump into the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Meder, collector of pools discovers copies highlighted in his research on Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Next to the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Budapest Széchenyi, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique Karst cavity (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca bathrooms), as well as some hot springs, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while citywide puts eyes in the indoor pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool for a dip in St. Anton, y: in the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski slopes. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The design, perhaps more extraordinary waits for customers in hotel: the Cathedral of Ötztal water seems a UFO that has just landed in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Three open source upload steam in winter, while background Ötztal mountains rising in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> At Meder, collector of swimming pools, not was it invading the smell of chlorine in all pools. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell sulfur in the baths of Békescsaba, Hungary Árpád, the plague to diesel is so strong that people believed to have come to a sanitary bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose silt sticking to the skin into the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way. </seg>
<seg id="677"> IRIS Meder also was disappointed in a place in their quest for nice bathing places, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and baths of Sun in the Czech Luhatschowitz bathroom, he found a locked field. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath architect Duan Jurkovic 1902 was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Meder looked through the crumbling Windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds growing between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Decay counters in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These baths have three phases of construction after it; not only you can find elements neorománicos of time of its construction in 1844, if not also an Arab style Alhambra hall, added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> From his careful modernization in 1995, the thermal Palace is bath favorite collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the black forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It has much merit merging different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic&quot;, says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In a Palace and immersion in the thermal swimming-pool apparently is not very important. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Land speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> Deutsche Bank examines the business of raw materials </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Resignation Deutsche Bank to your business with agricultural raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the head of the Consortium wants to show the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg, </seg>
<seg id="692"> For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable that banks cannot gamble with raw materials agriculture like wheat or maize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions should be withdrawn from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer Foodwatch organization. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges make up prices and banks bear the responsibility of the world hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the Consumer Ombudsman addresses in particular Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley Act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, bets on raw materials is thought to protect traders from fluctuations in prices. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Leading experts are in agreement that players have decoupled the offers and demands, and take profit of the costs of the poorest. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann reacted to criticisms of U.S. competitors differently: he promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;worth compromising the reputation of Deutsche Bank&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the report of Foodwatch claims. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then will present the results to the directors of the Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation of how handle the matter. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January, the direction of the Bank shall inform the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the end could be a reduction of the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann tries to fix her image. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, held the news, but it reaffirmed its criticism of the financial sector: &quot;bets at rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently damaging the public welfare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank must cancel all their portfolio investments which put at stake the money for bets in food prices,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;No matter if Ackermann is the subject of the people passing hunger or the fame of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> Inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the Consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his post. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will change something different to you had not planned on the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And you need that just they imported possible losses, that will deal with his successor. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Two-thirds adoption would deny them the investment in raw materials </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Barely 10 per cent felt legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments in which play the food prices. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many clients of the Bank showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds adoption would deny them all investments that get money from land speculation. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 Percent desaconsejaría a Bank so to acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflection, cancel your account and changed to another Institute. </seg>
<seg id="721"> The 21 House in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The transferred Pavilion </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a Museum, stayed empty and collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it opens as exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The architecture of modern postgerra are passionate about, clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of the thinking on technical progress, for what, the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix for architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered today a contemporary landmark of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austria flag in the following Exposition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary Tower of four cylinders for more MBW adjacent building flattened in Munich, became internationally known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its flag, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was lifted after the universal exhibition in Schweizer Garten Station South of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened inside a Museum of the 20th century, was called the &quot;House 20&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was adequate but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a Museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Despite this it was used until that contemporary art in Vienna had a new home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building has been empty since 2001 and falls more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the Pavilion, now called &quot;casa 21&quot; and will be used in the future as Museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> The Tuesday evening opened the Museum belvedere, to which belongs the House, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new Director of the Austrian Gallery belvedere since 2007, achieved a new beginning. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and Director-founder of the Museum of modern art, Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funding and private sponsors and established its use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for the contemporary art, are the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba in the eponymous Foundation, should have a cafeteria and a library and also to build an office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Low budget, strict control </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the best choice to do so. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he reformed to a significant extent the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, it expanded and was awarded the contest, if not because he studied under Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was for him a &quot;place important and huge&quot;, which provided &quot;almost all weekends&quot; exposures. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I knew the project and the problem of the building, who disappeared with his transfer to Vienna with its change of use with generosity and ease. </seg>
<seg id="744"> There are major problems in current reforms, the building was &quot;a Devourer of energy&quot;, said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Changed the profile of the façade of glass Windows, was installed an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass and replaced the glass by a special safety glass ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and the roofs of asbestos were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two cellars were used for the new use, a light panel dropped between the House and the street provides the illumination, serves as a bridge to join the almost new building, but still the flag of Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Remain the original exterior doors, the House is painted in shades of old mahogany and protected against oxidation. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And cinema is exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this with a strict control of the Office of monuments and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often had to find material that it was good, cheaper and also liked the Office for protection of monuments&quot;, says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The Pavilion &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> An architecture is always &quot;in the wrong place&quot; and therefore wanted to &quot;wake up the appropriate awareness&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, has been a stroke of luck urban. Totally new and planned &quot;from the central station&quot;, with homes and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps happens another stroke of luck: the House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Berlin art room and as he hears, negotiated with the city on a neighbouring place in Schweizer Garten. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Deutsche Bahn plans to a package of crisis of winter million </seg>
<seg id="758"> The company has devised a plan of crisis, avoiding breakdowns of trains in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> You must double the number of staff. </seg>

<seg id="764"> Among other things, planning to bend employees internal and external to 16,000 posts to remove the snow of the tracks and platforms. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The objective is to clear the walkways of snow and ice for the functioning and 90 per cent of the necessary switches to operate in a period of four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, Chairman of Deutsche Bahn warned of breakdowns and delays on the trains this winter after a Summit with the Government and the industry. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Deutsche Bahn last winter suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, that, among other things, lacked reserves to adverse weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Many new regional trains have been years waiting for authorization from the federal railway Office. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Deutsche Bahn is working since years in check the axes of the high-speed trains often in the workshop, once a high-speed train suffered rupture of an axis in the Cologne central station. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars fines in the United States.UU. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the tumult on President Josef Ackerman, appears a new problem in the United States.UU., Deutsche Bank must pay there a million dollar fine. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the United States.UU. get to the giant of the industry, the Frankfurt Institute pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to put an end to strife due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative of credit during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It&apos;s the sale of mortgage securities. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The NCUA financial markets regulator complains many large banks to mislead by false promises credit cooperatives to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without requiring the parties to go to court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank does not accept any fault with the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $ 20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Debbie Matz, Chairman of the NCUA, held the courtesy of both financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions.UU. and provides support in bankruptcy to protect the investments of clients. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA seeks to reintegrate million losses arising. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Currently closed agreements are the first type. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator had also requested accounts to other large banks and established summer lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="785"> In the case of dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities. </seg>
<seg id="786"> These are based on housing loans. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the real estate bubble in the United States.UU. it erupted in 2007, led to the downfall to many financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers U.S. Investment Bank collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Although the results followed some years ago, currently blows a wind complicated for us banks. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Inspection and investors have filed countless processes to receive compensation or punish misconduct. </seg>

<seg id="792"> It accused the 18 major international banks that the two mortgage agencies State Americans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have profited from the business of mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars. </seg>

<seg id="857"> UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slipped a crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now headed by a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Sure that Axel Weber had not thought. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the Summit of the federal Bank, July met that in a new and almost equally spectacular work would begin in 2013: President of the Administrative Council of the Swiss Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber rejoices publicly, commended Switzerland for its beauty and UBS on its newly acquired strength and drops kind comments on his future teammates. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The USB has a revitalization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September it became clear that everything would be totally different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the Bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Administrative Council of the USB was considered since then also played, and everyone asked: When does arrive Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Met that Weber must advise the Bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will take over the Presidency of the Board of Directors in may, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard for Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not banker, rather, Professor of Economics and Advisor and has been a period of adjustment certainly necessary. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Coup is responsible for the strategy of a Bank, just to prove he deserves the title &quot;the biggest bank scandal in Europe&quot; long. </seg>
<seg id="873"> On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently was the largest global property administrator, and on the other hand, for years, slides in a scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, so seems it, will save the once so proud Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> The financial crisis began. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of Swiss goods administrator discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand, with $ 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world&apos;s big banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This impresses. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the former banker and later Professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: &quot;To my students always have qualified to the USB as a model of a good Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From the current point of view, one wonders: how could mistaken?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It was a big mistake. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Mid-year, Peter Wuffli, director-general, which until then was regarded as a brilliant and highly intelligent, banker surprisingly resigned. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, suspected the reason. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Bank Investment Fund embarked on with high-risk securities losses and had to repay billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To load this, USB announced an injection of capital of no less than 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this found investors, of course that some look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque State Fund of Singapore and a State Fund Arab, so discreet, who had never heard his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was just the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it got worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, he continued the catastrophe, in view of their misguided investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought distressed securities from UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billions of francs by a mandatory convertible bond, through which he became co-owner of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> All Switzerland was affected, stated dramatic it was this for a small country, if houses as large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the sum of the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Can not return to bail out UBS,&quot; said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster was joined by the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, that were possibly disappointed taxes with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, approved a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with a severance payment. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thereby, the UBS confessed more or less have aided in tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Simultaneously lost something that had always been its capital in competition by rich clients: the aura of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> This followed the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of funds from the clients. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In this way, in a few months the Bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: banking investment through erroneous speculation and asset management through support for tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when I was back at something more quiet, just when you thought UBS returned to achieve this, does this unfortunate story of the operator, an individual operator disappoint 1.7 billion euros, before the Bank realized that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And is unveiled, it seems, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli manifests that risk controls have changed too little&quot;, says Martin Janssen, Professor of Economics and finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is also safe: &quot;the problem of the UBS is not domina risk controls&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="911"> What emerged the idea of the caution with which Swiss Bankers were long time, be the guardians of the major assets of the world: any too large risk, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Security of the Swiss bank deposits were the symbol of reliability unwavering, authentic chocolate Sprüngli and Lindt. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The central of UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, is only slightly larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classical. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank is headquartered in the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes directly from the main station to the Lake of Zurich, framed by the peaks covered with snow of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Here were among jewelry stores like Tiffany&apos;s Swiss traditional businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Living here years Swiss banks: from the National Bank, passing by the Palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios banks private Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are marble, coated front are big leather armchairs, next to the logo of the Bank there is a large sign to indicate &quot;security&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what customer search here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, sometime has shifted the idea of the big Swiss Bank, or have betrayed her, and believes the President of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and all makes, as all Swiss Bankers, also with the business of both big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS has become too big, is of the opinion, mainly in the investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Hence the Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And they have grown accustomed long customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, gave his first big gain and then came the disaster, any European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> October 15, 2008, the disaster was apparent. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday the coalition Government of the small country of seven million decided the largest bailout in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;the crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="930"> Politicians granted up to 68 thousand million francs or about 45 billions of euros to save the Bank from bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How can you think of? </seg>
<seg id="932"> Talks with Swiss Bankers, so see the problem in the dimension of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the big three Swiss banks merge in a powerful Consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Arises a bank which, due to the merger, was too large for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> By serving so that two different banks precursor of UBS complemented: a rich Bank but slept with the center of the property management in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came in a timely manner with lots of money, which could make shooting a great financial bicycle. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two names associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Council. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the modest intellectual who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to break through from learning in the Bank up to the Summit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, Ospel fió of Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And in the end Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: &quot;Thought that their models were a reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: the nonsense came before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> UBS employees remember clearly meetings managers, which Wuffli, the head of the Consortium, always repeating the same motto: lose the throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> They China&apos;s leading the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the classifications then documenting the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> UBS wanted to be at the Summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps worked it well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the Forex trading and the negotiation of shares was at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> However, responsible business advisers drew attention to a weak point: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge compensation for the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has gaps in American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill these gaps, the UBS began an affair which almost costs him his existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Eager for growth, they invested the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investments of high risk. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It became a powerful machine for titularizar American mortgages and sell them below, keeping certain risks to their own account. </seg>
<seg id="956"> And also, as other banks sought the descent for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great euphoria, so deep the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to leave, that the attempt of order proved more complicated than he expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts in the UBS became tundishes seats and are unsafe to the present day. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Currently, who heads a large Bank, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> You must find a strategy for a Bank, to which all logical business models are lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The Bank does not want to go that far (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking must be reduced much, is clear now. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new President of the Bank, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In reality, only thought in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a transitional solution, that the Bank the Bank surprisingly broke away from his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, he prevailed: must permanently business of UBS, Zurich Bank reported on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to return to the Bank of investment to its State in the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Suppresses 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But this is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what you want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that surely is Axel Weber currently. </seg>
<seg id="976"> So far only says that he will first seek a home with his wife in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The following year. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, the beauty and pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): an intimate story about the first world war, &quot;begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one you collapse the soul at the foot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Here are some tips for action: gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Come to know very well these people the novelistic narrative of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae will act as your GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Mr Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> What has been written here is an unusual book, aptly, as &quot;a work of anti-historia&quot; describes. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains some important treaties, notable names or famous battles; There is virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, &quot;a book about how it happened&quot;. It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and States of humor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and pain of the battle&quot; combines the experiences in times of war more or less 20 men and ordinary women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.&quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some become prisoners of war, or will lose its members, become insane or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives flickering here as votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mixture while others turn off. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book of Mr Englund is a deviation from the standard history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is also a corrective to the notion that the first world war was only the disastrous war of trenches on the Western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; moves from an expert form through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book they fall above beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is a poignant book, almost from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war fills the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When artillery fire can be heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, you&apos;re or huyes? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Anyway who come from? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost no one understands what is happening, nor even why have to fight this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Lack of facts&quot;, observes Mr Englund, &quot;is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; continues to individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the high seas fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories have been mostly memoirs, letters and other material previously published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details of Mr Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of these are about deprivation and cope with what there is. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About the story of a German schoolgirl says: &quot;Substitutes substitutes everywhere&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Ersatz coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, bands of paper, wood buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Continues talking about the substitute lunch in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> It describes &quot;meat made from rice cooked and pressed in mutton fat (and topped); with a false bone made of wood&quot; tobacco made of roots and dry potatoes peladuras; &quot;shoes with wooden soles&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There are notes, &quot;837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories are about honour and value. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes its own momentum towards savagery and expresses about the war: &quot;Feel that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit on chairs with a cigar and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that veneer means civilization and there is a barbarian behind that frayed washed and studded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> On the other hand a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that nobody will know or will mind. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the audience&quot;, writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> On the other hand, it is horribly similar &quot;to a convicted person being strangled in secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict has become increasingly more in economic competition,&quot; writes Mr Englund, &quot;a war between factories&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Reflects an influx of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the murderer in eloquent and convinced mass ideologically with clothes of good clothing running its carnage while seated behind a desk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unexpected ways; There are both ignoble behavior as heroic. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who attempted to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The more grotesque expression of this can see the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and thereby embadurnan their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those who are truly desperate rubbed it over his eyes, which often leads to blindness in for life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to their human task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to &quot;unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People start to ask why their leaders are doing them to combat. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the first world war have often been indirect, as the great war and modern memory Paul Fussell, or novels without new in front Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive histories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon of unconventional. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has one of the endings more devastating that I can remember in a work of non-fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I daresay not. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned her with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a faux pas prior, an assault planned to the minute </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> He chose the night of Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, saying initially to others that were joining an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The inspector of police Raymond w. Kelly was at the Center, their presence underlined how the operation plagued of challenges to the Police Department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> They could not repeat the episodes in recent weeks, as the spraying of spray pepper on the protesters, infringe the Department regulations and creating a storm of public sympathy for the &quot;squatters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And that is why the police operation to clear the Park Zuccotti of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Officials had prepared seeing as occupations had been developed in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A simulacrum of major catastrophe was taking place at Randalls Island, with one eye looking Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Agents increased the so-called training of disorders - measures contraterroristas involving quickly mobilize a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was on the night of Monday, on the side of Manhattan of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders of entering the Park arrived at the &quot;last minute&quot;, said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as &quot;an exercise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;A few cops I know that they were called to this, they were not told that it was to enter the Zuccotti Park&quot;, said the person, who spoke anonymously. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were in the highest levels of the Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, some officers wanted to clear the Park, but withdrew when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation on Tuesday involved agents of various police units, including special forces of the borough - dozens of mobile agents that usually used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the Park during the day, making the 1 am a good time to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;Was appropriate to do so when it was the lowest number of people in the Park,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The emergency services unit with lights and speakers trucks congregated at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and pre-recorded messages which rumbled from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Community Affairs officers went to the park with their light blue Windbreak, many demonstrators simply collected his things and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Not was played no shop until the 1: 45 a.m., said the police, giving time to the demonstrators to gather their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if needed make arrests in the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul j. Browne, the Police Department chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists said it attempted to prevent firsthand to the police action in the Park, and they had been treated roughly by agents. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that mobile units of television in Church Street, along the western edge of the Park, could capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> As the police moved westward through the dense maze of personal effects of the protestors, including baggage and crowded clothes, paper and plastic garbage bags the Department of cleaning equipment followed, picking up what was left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A core group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Surrounding about 10 people in the epicentre of the camp are they candaron among them by the arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people encadenaron to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Emergency services officers were called to cut the locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests in the park were made until about 3: 30 a.m., said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests were for &quot;disruption of public order and resistance to authority&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The agent of highest rank in the scene was Joseph j. Espósito, the head of the Department, the senior uniformed in the Department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the Chief of detectives of the Department, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr Kelly, while he was present, &quot;was not conducting operations,&quot; said Mr Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of agents waiting along the side East Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, where they were to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Rose barricades in the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and the Pine Street, a block to the South. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From these positions, was the police expand the scope even further than the Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At any given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the louder action of the night took place to the South of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5 a.m., to the South of the Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from a police van wheels. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> In the end, an agent and one protester were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The Trade Union of workers of support will demand to the city by the dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The Union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The demand is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the Union, of the municipal district 37, in his effort to revoke the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two assistants of the school, parent coordinators and other employees that were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a move that Union leaders have described as a political payback for his refusal to allow, last spring, the city access to a Fund of health care carried out by working groups to close its budget gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing at the Town Hall last month, the Minister of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Council countered saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the support staff of the school would be dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Borough 37 officials said they presented the claim in writing, warning that it would be sued the Department of education. Be held a press conference on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all women black or Latino, like the majority of workers who lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen demand and therefore could not to comment on specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a demand draft obtained by The New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, that had been insufficiently supported chronically. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Stated that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in 8 districts and 9 in the South Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students living in poverty, demand says, &quot;This is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S. District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which estimated the additional funding for each enrolment for poor school student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The Union also claims that principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memorandum used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, despite the fact that &quot;surplus&quot; describes the Act of moving a master of the payroll of a school a job board, whose salaries are paid by the central office with greater frequency. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six parents coordinators were dismissed,&quot; says the draft complaint, &quot;and not only in surplus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Completed mission, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed was that the rebellion were to succeed, that the veteran dictator Muammar-Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the participation of United States came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican from Arizona) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Connecticut independent), applauding the Libyans by his successful rebellion and the troops of the United States.UU. for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honor the brave Libya, we begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It&apos;s an affirmation of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarrelled among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the military in the United States.UU. the Mission of NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of military forces of the United States.UU. in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and which was never voted on in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day that Bill was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That left the Mission of EE.UU. in a kind of purgatory Legislative - Congress upset enough to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry to really reap the grass under their feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then, the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> NATO&apos;s mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate may be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the armed forces of United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary bravery and professionalism&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measure will gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divide lawmakers as it did Bill of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard g. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the Committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The place spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen yet the final version of the new Bill. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic that in fact achieves a vote of the whole House in the House or the Senate during this Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have failed so far to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of attempts. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlatte is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are duplicates - the same draft law proposes both in the Chamber and in the Senate--and others with slight variations among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the amendment just budgetary balance in the camera, and another handful who &quot;monitor federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially beginners Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The budget Control Act, which was approved in August, required that both the House and the Senate voted a balanced budget amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while Representative José e. Serrano (Democrat-New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for Presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The representative Jesse l. Jackson Jr. (Democrat-Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the States. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As enthusiasts who have been members in proposing amendments, are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111 Congress, lawmakers proposed amendments 77 and made 66 in the 110 °. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace is unacceptable compared to the early 1990s, when the members regularly presented 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they had no more success then of what they have now. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Battered but not defeated,&quot; Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shooting him at point-blank range at a Tucson constituent Act, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television Monday night, he sang accompanied by the Broadway Melody &quot;the sun goes tomorrow&quot; and said that he wanted to recover more than what I wanted to return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In his appearance on ABC News &quot;20: 20&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The programme documented their difficult way back of the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that pass from the front to the back of his head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the camera to triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, is rio and sang - and described his recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked him how it feels, Giffords, of 41 years, replied: &quot;Quite well&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of &quot;20: 20&quot; of one-hour, which aired the eve of the publication of the new book by the couple, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in his hospital bed, with a shaven head and a long scar across his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can only maintain one or two erect fingers, while her husband encouraged. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach how to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A head movement. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A fruncimiento of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, his first word: &quot;What?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In a few days, Giffords gave another word - &quot;toast&quot;, a request for change in its breakfast menu. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: is the Congressman to singing the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; Cyndi Lauper and Tom Petty&apos;s &quot;Free Falling&quot; along with the therapists. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, makes two hours of therapy every day, said that he does not remember the day of the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that an article in the newspaper about the assassination on March 12 when she stopped him to ask first about the six who died in the incident I was reading him to Giffords. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died&quot;, he told Giffords to Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I told him,&quot;&apos; Gabby, not have been defeated,&apos; &quot;Kelly said.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;Just you&apos;ve been hit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1442"> &quot;You gonna get out of this, gonna recover and are going to come back stronger than ever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The troops felt more pity that I respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a gala of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for Veterans homeless in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad about the powerlessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> At that time, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines stormed their positions around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The multitude of label stood up and they applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women were regarded as heroes&quot;, said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising of spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A military officer of high rank in the gala, also known as the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> The official &quot;Showed them as a kind of orphan&quot;, wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> They had them. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it wasn&apos;t respect for truth. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The sharply conflicting views illustrate the difficult relationship that has seized the military and often distant American audiences, sometimes, worshiper. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Troops was lavished with praise by their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price, say members of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public increasingly acts more as if give penalty those uniformed. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We&apos;re not victims at all,&quot; said Sean B. MacFarland brigadier general, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart towards Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way that some show their support is put to us in the role of helpless souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who don&apos;t want to seem desagradecidos or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also realize that anger that faced the troops who returned in the last years of the war of Viet Nam was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result, most pity talks carried out in silence and in private among war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After their two children returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them of people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some look them with a feeling of fear because it clashed with the insurgents and traveled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others will wonder if there would be a &quot;veteran angry and violent beneath the surface&quot;, said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of the Government working in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During their search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked subtly if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his combat tour. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service, need to deal with negative perceptions,&quot; recalled Cancian telling their children. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Arises the military concern, part of American indifference toward the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Accomplishments on the battlefield are rarely chosen to praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We, as a nation, already not value the military heroism in ways which were quite common in World War II&quot;, said the retired lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded the troops of the United States.UU. in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, praise from politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops are renowned for the number of tours that have withstood, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army faces increasing pressure to put an end to the violation </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a historic hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for its alleged passivity before the violation. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says that she was raped by a fellow. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was October of 2008, and was headed back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, North of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a package of 12 cans of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;It sounded an alarm signal,&quot; says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> However, the Texas native left aside its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, no, it has 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;Texas is&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I had listened to my instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, pulling it down and raping her, alleges. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Lyman and other current and former military personnel&apos;s 27 members anxiously a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, go to trial. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed, the reduction of rape widespread among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand initially implied to 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 men and three women, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by co-workers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver justice appropriate after the alleged assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke said that it goes to the staff of the army, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a structure from top to bottom&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are people who are able to eradicate the culture of retaliation?&quot; &quot;The high command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her about 400 survivors, many of which could be part of future demands. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: rather than accumulate all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed defence strategy - in essence, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers by the injuries sustained in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> A 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal Government is not responsible for the damage sustained by the staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;Alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the documents say. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern warfare rarely have clear the front lines. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both Iraq and Afghanistan soldier women teams are playing increasingly important roles, to reach local women in war zones especially. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the army also modernized, said Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in their struggle, and other three demands are underway, as well as the yours. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The Yale Law School, legal services for Veterans clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies promoting a misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the Organization non-profit Viet Nam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army which focuses on &quot;personality disorder&quot; diagnosis assigned to rape victims in order to give discharge from the service - a common event, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the action women&apos;s network in servicea human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way that handles claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine Bills have been submitted separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of Senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 there was 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for Sexual assault prevention and response of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, the attacks are remarkably below reported, and by the own estimates of the Pentagon, which figure in about 13.5 percent of the 19000 ladies incidents that occurred that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March, also examines levels of processing: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the Army went to trial - half that the civil justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation to the military police less than an hour before it happened. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, he says, was asked that you had details of his rape 11 times than a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of its aggressor - of a cut on his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which asked about that had sexual relations with her boyfriend the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people declared to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day on which was read the verdict&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They put me in the Psychiatry Unit, and when I came out, I remember that I told my command officer,&quot; &quot;That was not his view.&quot; &quot;That was my opinion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was ordered visit to a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made it unsuitable for the service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 she was provided services under least-that-Honorable terms, prevents him from receiving any benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his companions of demand continues, is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of law at George Washington law school. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, points out, &quot;in my opinion, they should be able to proceed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine which has been criticized since that was published for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it has the same incentive and deterrence arising from the liability. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And adds: &quot;the odds are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things only change when good people are willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the audience is not going his way, Burke, Attorney for the plaintiffs, will make the queue to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue fighting against the army in this topic until that reform occurs,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;Or until we die, whichever comes first.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: how researchers are studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aireaba their views anti-immigration online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being alone in cyberspace: had spent most of the time that preceded his attack against your computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - just enter on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that was not so difficult to reach them,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British Studies Center DEMOS. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The cache of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, Bartlett, says that researchers could simply use advertising tool to determine its desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way that marketers have been using for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Bartlett found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then addressed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 Parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;Is an entirely new way of doing research,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not entirely surprising: supporters in line of right-wing groups tend to be young people, men and angered by immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However, in a kind of twist, &quot;those that combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research centres, political scientists and medical researchers are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in the &quot;I like&quot; messages in the walls and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users by adding an average of three pieces of content a day, &quot;supernova data&quot; of Facebook is generating a rise of research, driving the number of scholarly works with the site name in the title to almost 800% in the past five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> To some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that he allows you to study people who not you could get with a folder in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you right to the British national party people survey, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You&apos;d have to go through the party, and they never allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook eliminates everything that - go to them directly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that college students who spoke of his exploits of drunkenness on Facebook had a risk significantly greater of having problems with the drink than the students who remained silent on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggested that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of State with their drunkenness. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;Not you can treat a problem if you can not diagnose&quot;, said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the center of health, behavior and development of the child in child Research Institute in Seattle, said the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would be undiagnosed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also is constantly &quot;clicking&quot; to its own population to obtain data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The team of site data has produced statistics on the State of the relationship and Valentine&apos;s day, the expectation of turnout halfway through the 2010 legislative period, and national happiness index (mainly using the information which can be accessed - digital freedom defenders for a long time that they argue that the site should be available other his large amount of data for research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, them like it or not - the sacrifice by to play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow site to mine your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey do not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free toolbar for all. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I don&apos;t think that many users have thought even the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, on a 2006 study conducted with the public walls of Facebook&apos;s students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;In so far as they concerned, it was only between themselves and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a subject of investigation this being completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information from the profile of a user and the wall messages are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> It is why, despite his years as technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen remained the best research tools that anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to real people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter during his first public appearance at the Court of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I&apos;m a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templar Knights of Norway,&quot; he told a room full with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I am opposed to the Court that he received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred, and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I admit the facts but I plead not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim disrupted Breivik for this monologue, because &quot;he didn&apos;t give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a platform to express their points of view&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason it refused to allow Breivik, which brought a speech written in advance, go to relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, forbidden access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control over all the visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is confined under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended with the objective of moving towards the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought he seemed cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked to the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the strange notion of Breivik of being part of a greater &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that act with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that some them consuele that attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not automatically softens the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I&apos;d like that, it seems, a monster, but it doesn&apos;t,&quot; said a family member of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be much easier if it seems.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 Lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, are shown in a theater this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some comparing it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the great modern Inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered to which has dusted and advancement of a number of major markets this week, special projections is understood how much this creative mind on business processes and workflows of the products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was certainly a designer, dreamer and autorreconocido hippie, but it was also a meticulous organiser and a junkie of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives were suffering &quot;a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work...&quot; &quot;[but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (the triumph of idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than one hour with Jobs for a rare and extensive conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time they had barely 10 years passed since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple and already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, hoping the popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview of Cringely used in Nerds, said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after the death of Jobs who discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This file, slightly reissued material is the basis of Steve Jobs: the lost interview, 68 minutes, reaching this Landmark theaters Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known for hating on in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And very thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> At four different points throughout the interview, there are large silences between the questions and responses - from 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is considering clear their thoughts, looking for accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also times where Jobs perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, pushing him to move faster towards issues or arguments of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there something strangely prophetic in the lost interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees that other companies make good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Read posthumous assessments of the race of Jobs is one thing, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of as they can and they should be things. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not long after explaining everything in detail here, was and did. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the lost interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On how he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;Over the years in the business, I always wondered:&quot; &quot;why do things?&quot; and the answers that give you of invariable form are: &quot;Oh, that&apos;s just the way as is done&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why it does what it does, business nobody thinks about things very deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Baffled by the way in there were costs - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that made eye of good cubero, and then he met with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs to detail. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the joke to the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> The &quot;blue box&quot; which he tells jobs built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people hack effectively to the telephone company and make free long-distance calls. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> He has written widely on the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT &amp;amp;amp;amp; T network to another, while creating a loop with the greatest possible number of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you gritabas through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public telephone on the door of the side&quot;, said Jobs with a giggle. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We two, we didn&apos;t know much, but could build something small that could control a giant thing - was an amazing lesson, and I don&apos;t think that Apple would have never existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter rather than the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On falling in love of technology (and selling) by telephone with Bill Hewlett: </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he sought out Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a job of part-time summer at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a notable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my view of what was a company and well dealing with its employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company in Palo Alto research laboratories, where he saw &quot;the first desktop ever made&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen cathode tube, and I fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> You would a trip to HP as a teenager and would waste time with that machine and write programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvising innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, that he devoted himself to sell a handful of motherboards, asked a customer whether he could mount the entire team. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the Assembly and delivery of the finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while at Apple, remember the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember having dramatic arguments... yelled that they would need five years [to create a mouse which would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large firms losing strength: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Much before that he lead the revival of Apple, Jobs prophetically anticipated the way that many industry leaders encounter in his vision, and would lose control of its market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Say that you work at IBM or Xerox, by what you do best printers, and photocopiers and what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, which is why the company is not more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing departments increase success, so are this kind of people ending for directing the companies and persons responsible for products are expelled from the forum for decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position flavr savr because of people who do not have the notion of good vs bad products products - knowledge of the necessary ex officio. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have been taken over the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They took the defeat of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... that evolves the great idea, change and grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> He learned a lot about the subtleties of the same. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrifices you have to do - some things that you can do to make the electrons, makes them the glass, make them robots, make them the factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at the same time... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> At the end all comes down to taste - it lowers to try to expose you to maybe a human team has done, and then trying to adapt those things that your&apos;re doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have never had shame about stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> What did partly grande to the Macintosh was that persons who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it were not for the computer, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with rivals of the law on health care while the Court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of if would accept the challenge to the law of health care of the Obama President, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the High Court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Judges agreed to admit the demand for processing and, indeed, expected an historic allegation of 5 hours and a half to March, and the result probably even more enturbiará the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time that the decision of the Court is known. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who appear before the Court and said that the law should be disposed of will probably be Paul Clement, who served as attorney general of the United States.UU. during the George w. Bush administration. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society, a group that has been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles for many years. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of independent business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the tribunal on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leading Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the law on health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The special dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It is nothing new: the two judges have been attending the federalist society events for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And is not something that enters into conflict with ethical standards. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were not, arguably they would fall under the Canon code 4 c, which reads: &quot;A judge can attend events to raise funds of organizations concerned with the law and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the agenda of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest was enough to alarm activists of ethics in Government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several Magistrates Court that abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (common cause). </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were treated in a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the Court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> His appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by critics who say that too easily mixed the activity of the tribunal with the agenda driven groups such as the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is judge Elena Kagan, which has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan served as solicitor general of the Administration Obama when the first legal challenges to the law were in the Court of first instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from see the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that he will. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing receives a record order of $ 18 billion </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Emirates airline calls 50 aircraft of twin aisle Boeing 777, with option for 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than one billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Rarely is news when a company obtains an order for 50 units of your product. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But is a great transaction when the company is the manufacturer of aircraft Boeing Co. and the price of sale for 50 aircraft amounted to a record of $ 18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future orders for aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimated over the next 20 years in Middle East airlines require 2,520 aircraft amounting to $ 450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced over the weekend its more big order history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Jet Boeing 777 twin aisle. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the sales price total to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced the 2011 Dubai air show. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts a saving of fuel and services for passengers spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The price of sale for six of them is more than one billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing,&quot; said analyst Morningstar Neal Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these clients in particular is very strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines in the middle are the property of their oil-producing Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but that a rise in prices of fuel - generally harmful for the airlines, because it is one of the major costs - is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the increase in the price of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;Have a natural protection, he said. </seg>

<seg id="1706"> The sister of President Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa María Calderón says that the drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for Governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have lost his candidacy to Governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tilt the race for one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for Governor of the Western State Fausto Vallejo, of the institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of crime organized throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the entire country,&quot; said Luisa María Calderón, in a radio interview a day after Sunday&apos;s vote. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers...&quot; &quot;They took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the Presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> However, it is the staging of a return, and the win in Michoacán is an important step in that effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have overcome narrow Calderón, who had led the polls before the election. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderón, a candidate of the Conservative Party of national action of his brother, or bread, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently occupies the position of Governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the unfortunate and divided left before the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> You aureoles also refused to recognize the results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, senior of the from the State capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacán has been long dominated by drug cartels specialize in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However, the violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A mayor of bread was assassinated a week before the election while he was campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidates for fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> But for the PRI, unpalatable as they may appear the Michoacan elections, a victory will help drive the party. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man supposed represent the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: &quot;I think that this victory should be very encouraging to next year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> ADB urges Asia to help to bail out eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China that they prepare to help bail out the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would impede the growth of the Asian economies. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, said that two large economies of more rapid growth in the world, had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries who observe the difficulties of Europe in an &quot;impartial&quot; manner and said that financial assistance from Asia along with leadership and European resources would help avoid a crisis in the global economy long-term. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So anyone that can help Europe out of the crisis is useful&quot;, told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but cannot be immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;Thus if Chinese and India can help, either by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy borrowing costs have soared dangerously and Italy and Greece the Prime Ministers have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help find a solution to the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag predicted that any support of Asia is channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the bonds of the EU, the European financial stability Fund rescue fund - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said that &quot;the India is going to do everything we can&quot; to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the inflow of foreign capital depletion. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants that the eurozone will remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, it is an imperative, because to find a jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that as India, developing economies have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States.UU., said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the Europe aid for the million two hundred thousand people of the India, of which up to 800 million living on close to $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;At some point you will see Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why the reserves of the India should be used to keep numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss as the railways. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens &quot;important effects in chain&quot; throughout Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The prognosis of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the &quot;downside risks&quot; due to the threat of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect themselves from a crisis and significant of capital outflows from their economies. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Serious warnings about possible cuts in Defense Pentagon </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, heated the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts that looming could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon is already digested the 450 billion dollars of cuts over the next decade, but now feared a further reduction of 600 billion or more that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican from Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called &quot;abduction&quot;, would give place to 23 per cent of global reductions and an end to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such large cuts, applied in this indiscriminate way, would that most of our naval projects and construction can not run - cannot buy three-quarters parts of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts&quot;, wrote Panetta to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also have to set aside many of our civil servants unintentionally, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilian in order to fulfil the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would break faith with those who hold our army and would seriously damage the willingness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts eventually would reach the combat troops, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While financing for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort will be affected negatively by the serious disruption in the budgets of base&quot;, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The recruitment of staff be reduced, which led to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;Staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be adjourned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts at the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense cause a rapid decline of the United States as a major world military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; said the senators in a joint communiqué the afternoon on Monday when they published the letter from Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a result that you can live, and is certainly not one that we should impose to us themselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat to the national security of the United States interests, and should not be allowed to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If the Panetta letter and recent warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts it remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly more franco on possible cuts, despite the fact that he arrived to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a Conference of press last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It&apos;s a boat without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a Brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air wing without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and pumps without sufficient troops trained to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his remarks opening at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force plagued by low morale, poor preparation and isn&apos;t able to keep abreast with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;Indeed, it invites aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta set out new details of how the reductions &quot;generated significant operating risks: delay in the time of crises, conflicts and disaster response;&quot; It severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed previously throughout the world; &quot;and it is an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that already are being tested and some only in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list includes the jet fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new boat of littoral combat and the new fighting vehicle on the ground that the army and Navy need to replace the humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stop development and additional evidence of the F35 could generate $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say he is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to detect a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the latest headlines shows us how serious and pervasive are deception and lies in daily life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The Pennsylvania State University administrators have been accused of perjury by allegedly hiding reports claiming that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone saying to the President of the United States.UU., Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and shaking countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The Congressman from New York and exhibitionist in Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials soon belied by the irrefutable proof. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations in the campaign financing related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And again, anyone who lived ever forget the circus media unleashed by President Bill Clinton to lie during his second mandate about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The legends about the traps in the school and University exams are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases in which teachers have given responses of examinations to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception are we? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> In one day, studies show that they can lie you anywhere from 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> This safe, many of those lies are pious lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that unknown people lied three times in the first 10 minutes of knowing. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect lies, or &quot;the location of lies&quot;, is a skill essential to that we must acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a board game similar to, for example, charade, where the objective is to exclaim: &quot;I have you&quot;, the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities that conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lies have been contested. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liars did look to the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Not always they stutter, stutter, is ruborizan or uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> It cannot conclude either that liars are difficult to detect or expose. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A trained lie detector can reach the truth learning about the structure of the Declaration, microfaciales expressions, the formation of questions and times. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent years probing the scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable driving their own emotions and feeling so intuitive how perceive them others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the Extroverts lie more than the introverted, men say more &quot;oriented themselves lies&quot;, while women say more lies &quot;oriented towards others&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone - who married persons lie less frequently to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies that say tend to be &quot;huge&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you is perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying him. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How to know if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, note the usual behaviour of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;create a baseline&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It helps to provide benchmarks to measure changes later. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Note the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is better to know if someone normally drum with his foot all the time to not make unjust accusations when see you the feet golpeteando in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then browse to misleading, verbal and non-verbal behaviour groups. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these groups of behavior as signs of alarm, not as proof of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body trying to remember its history, you can point your feet towards the door, tilt toward an exit, change its stance significantly or exhibit an &quot;postentrevista outlet&quot; - that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position after all the difficult questions have been completed. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often do see falsely that the interview had completed only to seek such relief postentrevista. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the past tense while he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for it at the national level. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> People who cheat also may use a spacer language: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question completely. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answer a difficult question: &quot;well... to be honest... to what I was... in my opinion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a sign of warning. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the artists of the scam in their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan of the oil pipeline diverted after the threat of the delay in the United States.UU. in its approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Days after administration of Obama threatening to delay the adoption of a pipeline planned from Canada up to the Mexico Gulf - angry unions, while it apaciguaba the ecologists - the company that seeks to build the pipeline says that the project is ready to redirect to move it back. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on Monday night that will move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska Sandhills, and hoped that the project will win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The directors of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company maintains its confidence that with time the pipeline will be adopted, while it is true that with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This comes following the announcement by the State Department last week from it delay the decision by a federal project permission until a new potential routes to avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast supply of groundwater study. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real way of progress,&quot; the representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, told Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State it is possible that it aside any decision until 2013, after the next year&apos;s election, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed them their full support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline, 1,700 miles extended from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would take 700,000 barrels per day in the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do so, it would be necessary to cross six States. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the region of Sandhills and the aquifer Ogallala, the major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current environmental impact of State Department study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered an independent evidence of the review process, focusing on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is if the Member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Advisor to Hillary Clinton&apos;s campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle defendant for allegedly provoking a child vomitara of fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York claims that the diva of music album, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a Madwoman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, aterrando his small daughter to the extent that vomited in fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The singer of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; diatribe frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much that he suffered &quot;changes of personality, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased their fear of strangers&quot;, says his family in Manhattan&apos;s Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November of last year when the tramoyista Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk caught the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, carried Genevieve. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that you stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &apos;Someone came up from behind and said,&quot;do you know what your daughter is doing?&apos; I told him &quot;Yes &apos; and went to take it&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle admonished angry pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;He said in an aggressive tone,&quot;Should have passed to his daughter near the gate&quot;, said Roseanna Monk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I told him,&quot;I have no interest in what you say or think.&quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It enraged and began to use bad words - the word (c) and the word J aloud... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> &quot;I had a bottle of water and began to pull the water from the bottle on me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1853"> He said that Genevieve was hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;You I told this woman,&quot;Look what&apos;ve done you to my daughter,&quot;said the mother of the girl.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle rushed on the mother - who still holding to Genevieve - and had to be contained by its environment and retreat to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Small was crying so hard that he vomited, he added. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle not returned calls for comment on what happened. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> Demand seeks unspecified damages, but the lawyer for the family, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money to get an Association of support to children with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,&quot; said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;Such conduct is totally unacceptable, especially when it turns to a teacher of kindergarten carried an 18-month-old child in her arms.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Climatic adversity has crippled the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, Sinaloa had increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment, and shrank the economy </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 Is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, it generated great expectations with regard to progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of beginning of year, there is no growth, is Yes instead registered a deterioration in key indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities for the State economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the Affectations for the Frost report, issued by the Mexican Council for sustainable Rural Development, were damage 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which the 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, major wrecked crops were vegetables, corn and garbanzo. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Until November, the fall in economic activity has generated a constant rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of statistics and geography the rate of State unemployment during the three first quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, because while from January to March 55 thousand sinaloenses 053 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active populationfor the second quarter the rate was a 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase up to 6.19 per cent, a rate which in number of people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, increased compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Lower liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa over the year is multifactorial, to economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, unemployment growth may explain indirectly, based on actions from public policy made. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What you are seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market effects of a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to combat money-laundering, for people to grab $ illicitly him it is no longer easy to work them&quot;&quot;to invest them and use something&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration arrested </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Lopez Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people ranging from the State in search of work abroad, in United States is has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they also have many difficulties in finding a job, these people is running and is demanding sources of work here in the State, which makes unemployment soar&quot;She said. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Informality </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Sinaloense labour market analysis is compounded when considering the high level of informality that prevails between the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38% of the employed population in the State serves without being listed as a worker before any institution of social security. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Coupled with unemployment and informality, another of the labour lags of the State are low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social insurance and the Ministry of labour and Social Welfare. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly income of sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 mil 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Coupled with the decline of economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 is recorded the greater decrease in foreign direct investment of the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of economy from January to June of State FDI totaled 630 thousand $697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent with respect to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year. </seg>

<seg id="1914"> The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree which brings forward the so-called &quot;analogical blackout&quot; from 2021 to 2015, to not join the eight votes needed to override it. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its powers by issuing the Decree detailing actions to be followed to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected by not reach the qualified majority of eight votes so the Court pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of Decree, and this is existing. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Draft statement, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional since the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and subject to law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favour of the draft only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the own Cordero Sánchez. </seg>

<seg id="1924"> The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better signal quality and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Defer change, he argued, would be to delay the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision in the public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, &quot;because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1978"> The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President Italy to present the new Government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> He is expected to present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new Executive will assume the position. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said that it would submit to the Chairman the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a Government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European Commissioner told reporters. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not say explicitly that you can form a Government, but the tone of their comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &quot;framework is now well outlined,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process of forming a Government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Underlining the pressure on Monti to give prisa, the volatility of the markets placed the BTP Italian bond yields, 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers, Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: &quot;We said that we would much support to this Government&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy out of this emergency situation. </seg>

<seg id="1993"> Parliamentary support </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Monti&apos;s new Government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian Association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> It put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi he would resign, Italian debt costs have now turned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will be successful. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti has said that his Government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that the politicians only give time to implement the reforms before early elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only by technicians, an indication of their objections before a process bound by financial pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political sources noted that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures. </seg>

<seg id="2048"> Some of the biggest shows we&apos;ve played over the past 21 years took place during the last couple of weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We played a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we are very eager to play there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did they discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places for surfing; that was how we learned, through people who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> To see the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have they planned for presentation at Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As ever we&apos;ve played there before, then we have no restrictions on what it can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; We will try to play a couple of songs on each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that it is partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we while not playing, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked these songs and we could have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us, and I therefore believe that also render it more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Looking back, it is hard to believe all what have been achieved? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Firstly, I believe that none of us will imagine that we would be in a great rock band and have done so for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We are counting our blessings and much thrilled us that we can continue to make music together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> All we want and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could not be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What meant for you having been part essential of the emergence of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> An honour to has always been be part of that group of big bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friends of the people of Mudhoney and Soundgarden, Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time arises a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honored to be part of the group in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Still we played with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are fortunate to still be friends of all of them and we are honored be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Also it is very strange that a band like yours stays United and with the same members therefore time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us to 13 years ago, which, by itself alone, is much longer than many bands last. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> Firstly, I think that all are fortunate to still be alive and, secondly, all we care about others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all very close friends, and thanks to that, have also opened musical avenues that give freedom to each experience. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of each and it could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; However, due to its success, they have been able to do whatever they want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do they find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> To as we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure that not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into that game and large crowds of people who loves your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> While one remember that people are there for the music, that remember you that you must respect the music and what brought her, without encaprichar to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really interested. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we write very good songs in the beginning was something great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for almost three years and never publish a disk until after that died Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were many frustrations because both last and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think in the incredible person that Andy was and how they made me laugh, always it was a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an amazing human being and we miss. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national band Las Mindaugas is responsible for opening the show on Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you know his work, notably Eddie Vedder, and that is why her they chose for opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we&apos;re anxious to see what the Mindaugas can offer live and duty be very entertaining. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do they always change the Yellow Ledbetter lyrics live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings and I think that it does with the first thing that comes to mind. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Bass, what are your influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> They are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> In the first that occur to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> They are so many that I could discuss bassists that I love all afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has Pearl Jam grunge despite no longer a fashion stay relevant? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that all of us always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all those that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are now making better music than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why is this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that seem perhaps lighter, but there are also songs, as The End or Just Breathe which qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed touched me them, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and lost a relative or a friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and these two songs, no doubt, represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I believe that you can be a happy person and still make music that is dark. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond polemics on fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Were the 80, in full swing of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few placards of promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the great Park of Metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Moreover, he accompanied a comparison in figures, with the New York Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the Park returned to raise, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, with the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the North-South axis but above (mountain) - down (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola natural park is in this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of Yogi bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these he was until that, in September, the City Council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for other so many doors of access to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door refers to the idea of Park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Or that or someone seeks to put gates to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question leaves single: Collserola Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The contest, its purely organizational side both which is reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme that dip when two members of this ancient breed of elected are recognized in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this fact gives, precisely, one of the few coincidences between what they think three Barcelona architects and university professors, that have been tabled. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldan, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayonne: the contest is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldan, after approached the coastal front &quot;is necessary&quot; discuss &quot;front mountain&quot;, given that the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, of Green apples, has not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It should be assumed that the largest park of Barcelona is the beach.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things by its great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> &quot;Collserola is more complex&quot;, sentence the architect for whom the title of &quot;door of Collserola&quot; contains a &quot;lexical trap&quot;: do not think them &quot;as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we must act&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, such as Roldan and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some risks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks of the &quot;uncertain that today is day project public space&quot; after the experience of the 1980s and which was in the area of the Forum &quot;his the swan song&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the own delimitation of borders where you can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something is already set the next step&quot;, i.e. his overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;You have to think in new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> More tight question, Mòdol believes that you simplifying, the Collserola vallesana side &quot;can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not&quot;, a purely topographic point. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol reminds that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;must not fall on deaf ears&quot;, although it appreciated the opportunity afforded by the town hall to your Guild to intervene in this project &quot;from the outset&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And further, understands that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the safe-conduct allowing architects to enter into the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; about whether this technical profile which must lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success&quot;, points) had to create: &quot;architects should be just a tool&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayonne hinted that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because the contest is missing an overview of Collserola: &quot;They have called 16 transverse contests - says - in the sense montaña-mar, but there is a longitudinal reading, see and understand the area as a whole&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This leads to, at least in his case, which has opted to participate in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can crash into program and definition with the architect of the door from the side. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his view, that Yes, the Council should ensure that the immediately superior to the Ronda de Dalt Strip should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green. </seg>

<seg id="2231"> During the legal proceedings, the agent of the public prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, he questioned Garcia Gomez if had repaired the damage and who members of the House of gambling was that granted pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Based on the dossier 197/2011 grant legal forgiveness to Jonah Larrazábal and thereafter it may not present claim process followed; addition to repair of damage is not required nor punishment. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the hearing to the legal representative of the House of bets, near the 15: 50 ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The Secretary of court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah who has legally been forgiven and your file will be closed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> It also shall order immediate release issued by the judge. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Pérez Jácome Dionisio Secretary gives details of the plane crash where the Interior Secretary, Francisco Blake, was killed and seven other people </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) reported results on the accident where the Interior Secretary, Francisco Blake Mora, was killed and seven people, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, while the pilot could attempt a forced landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that before take-off the aircraft, the pilot confirmed that weather conditions were right to fly. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> It was also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had requirements to transport personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, he said that made investigations in the area of impact does not report the appearance of pieces on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a search are reported that there are no parts or components of the ship somewhere else, the impact was presented of structural form.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, had appropriate requirements to transport passengers. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the Secretary said that it is a priority to have the outcomes; However, the investigation can last for several months, it could even reach one year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> For its part, Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General staff operated in cruise speed and that this happened in a bottom-up soft ground. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant element in the research: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the aviation regulations flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Meteorological conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Reports in Mexico were conditions to take off, as it progresses the aircraft towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico were layers of cloud cover at low altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Is likely to cloud the crew conditions has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility into the Valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of impact and the last row of the aircraft&apos;s radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of remnants of the aircraft in a small area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of dispersal of remnants of the aircraft suggest that the helicopter crashed on the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Evidence of fire or explosion is not detected: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> On the site of the incident remain undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the research indicate that it may have had multiple contacts with the field. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work pieces of the aircraft at an elevation of 9,000 have been found 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which predictably dismantled along this route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provided elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have multiple impacts on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After the thorough search in a wider area than the lacing site around the accident, not found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS Announces Protocol to find obesity gene </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Directs the Social Security an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; is supported in the IPN specialists </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that he directs an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called Protocol &apos;Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence&apos;, which allow to have markers associated with being overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the unit of medical research in biochemistry of specialties of the 21st century National Medical Center Hospital, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it was composed of a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by scholars and postgraduate students of the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Center for research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In the research are invited to participate to the population whether or not a claimant attend sports participating units of the IMSS in the Mexico Valley, where carried out tests to children, every Saturday from 8: 00 pm. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the Protocol began in the unit sports Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that from October 8, the activity is carried out in the unit sports Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once is complied with the aim of bringing together 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the sports unit independence (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos sports unit (to the North of the Federal District). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of the development of obesity genetics and identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> Celebrate it on November 14 the World Diabetes Day, he pointed out that the objective is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You will also be asked about physical activity and heredofamiliares history of diseases, for the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He explained that on Saturday they applies to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), takes blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (it seeks to identify genes involved in childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López pointed out that this research reflects the concern of the health professionals by alarming weight gain in children. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos; Health in 1999 and 2006 surveys indicated that in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of children, from 77 per cent in obesity, and 47 per cent girls; in terms of overweight also noted a dramatic rise &apos;, stressed the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said the justification for the search of the markers is based on that of the country&apos;s population differs from others by their genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It was reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of estate Indian American, 30 per cent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored as fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral assessment of children, which can detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even said, the presence of folds of dark color (Acanthosis) neck and forearm, indicating the probability that suffers from metabolic disturbances and even prediabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it by writing to the parents, who they explained each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that should be done to prevent diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentary lifestyle, that is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e., increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc) with a high content in fat and protein and genetics which is dealt with in this Protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If signals that sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Nájera Herrera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (CF) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is the appropriatepotholes could be reduced in amount or even eliminated altogether. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture A technological view of potholes, issued within the framework of the international year of chemistry, unveiled the laboratory responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the North of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, a high molecular weight, called asphaltene and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give the pavement their characteristic behavior memory foam. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Memory foam asphalt behaviour is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius the viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the road becomes brittle, it added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that on the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but that will change during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> CF researcher noted that the streets of the city of Mexico are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involving the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then packed. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the pebbles which constitutes the folder, he noted, is bathed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Transit vehicles and generate efforts, this allows forces to be disseminated very well on pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> They would if it were modified asphalt be they disseminated even better, felt the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the asphalt, it added, is placed a last layer called folder of Raceway, which is made up of a fine stone material, i.e., an arena that also bathes in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of vehicles, must you have more mechanical strength than the asphalt and provide friction on the road. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> To be part of the pavement will receive and impart the efforts, the Raceway folder, also requires, have the appropriate thickness and material of which it is made must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground is moistened, water spreads the folder inside and out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the film of bearing and only later affects the asphalt, but damage does not happen instantaneously, but it is a process that should attend the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Also member of the national system of researchers explained that vehicular pollution is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement must go always under vehicular load and ensure full compliance, to avoid potholes forming frequently. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, that in other countries they are even in the market and allow to repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What you failed the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that contributed to that Melina Ramirez Serna don&apos;t reach the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The Valley receives his number 14 of Princess title. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle with be on the winners podium, wearing the Crown of silver and the band that credited it as new Princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the Crown and sceptre, the Department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina is a legion of vallecaucanas women who have been close to the Crown but were declarations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979)Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many ask is what failed? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the police and Queens best face Vogue Jolie, titles which they obtained as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor which is considered key in the decision took the jury to appoint her first Princess is not convinced with his answer to the question &quot;What is that book that you marked to you and why?&quot; made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the literary Leamos cart. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The interrrogante the recently responded: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think that it is a form of culturalizarse, definitely think the book that marked me of childhood is&quot;The little Prince&quot;, is a fairly deep book.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot;, is a book of literature that everyone must read; and today I&apos;m reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The burning of the blood&quot; &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that little liked by the term &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and not explain second first concrete how every one of the books cited have marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina stated to feel calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe is passes wise what needs to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> &quot;And for all people, please read a little bit,&quot;The little Prince&quot;is a great book&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Between released scenarios is said to Valley her burned favouritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovacionada and the candidate carried all the preliminary Awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and why not shined on stage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it noted in its first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of Coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although both it looked secure, noted that he lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic Yes showed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;As at home&quot;, of the RCN expressed the view that the fact that Melina was designated Princess &quot;check that the candidate that most awards won during the contest remains as Queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valley was last very elusive with the press, and there was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valley did not convince the jury on his interest in social work, which is at last, the essence of the national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty expressed that they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, have to look at more than the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, who before entering the competition are already involved in projects&quot;, explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is also speculation Valley sinned for its defects in the derriere and fibrosis that noticed you in your abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate &apos;Natural beauty&apos; with the body more healthy, good nutrition and responsible for physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of Queens Jorge Hernan Orozco recognizes that Melina was not the best body, which had better, &quot;but your problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, the truth for me was very notorious, he came down points on the last day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile journalist Guido, of the stickers magazine finds that the error of the regional was surgical interventions which are practiced. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;Surgeries are fine, but Valley is them failed to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2338"> &quot;His body was never strong and they here claimed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this prize, that for the first time gives the national beauty contest, after the parade in swimsuit emerged a cruel prophecy that last night was fulfilled, as it was said that this was the contentillo Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving him the pleasure of the Crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as Princess, position which gives you the possibility to represent Colombia at one of the international contests for designation of their own national competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, she will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its overwhelming passage by Cartagena, was elusive Crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officers is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On November 4 a lofoscopista of the CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum Chief of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, through the comparison of their fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the branch of the CTI, this week played &quot;availability&quot; question time Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who has 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where they were the bodies which should be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after conducting the relevant courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of skin friction, IE, palms of the hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar they warned him to take minimum clothes for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big was waiting for him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The Friday night came out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I knew that it should identify two corpses and that it suspected that one of them was the man heading the oldest guerrilla movement in the world, by what he asked him to take card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when she arrived with the research team to the site in which the corpse was not recognized by their physical appearance, as it was very different from who he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It was without beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye not failed him: was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, a native man of Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm him to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, yes it was the maximum head of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González, at the press conference by the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people don&apos;t know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactiloscopistas is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support research for offences such as theft and homicide and confirmed the identity of the persons captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they are caught, many criminals present false certificates or have no papers. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take them the fingerprint printing and look for them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The investigator told that in a case of theft, fell it to remove a piece of wall of a House, because there the thief had supported his hand to get a safe deposit box full of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;Walls are difficult because they are not areas appropriate to get a fingerprint printing but then could obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,&quot; he recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also discard or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor to her around. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Through research, it was determined that a family member might be suspect of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that it has been the killer, yes locates it at the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in objects &quot;fingerprints are drawn with chemical reagents or physicists&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, a transplantador is used or tape to lift them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After this, the prints are sent Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registrar. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians&quot;, said the expert of CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television show. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything that touches becomes footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Indignant&quot; challenge to authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators are agolpaban before the plaza of Zuccotti camping. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A much attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Members of the movement takes Wall Street defied Tuesday to New York authorities try to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the plaza of Manhattan where they were evicted at dawn and trying to deal with another Park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators are agolpaban before the plaza of Zuccotti, where wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the &quot;indignant&quot; return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying one Park North of the city, where there has been new arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that, if the Court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we&apos;re going to install somewhere else and will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the spokesmen for the movement &quot;Is Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray explained that the response of the &quot;indignant&quot; to evacuate their camp personally issued by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order which prohibited the forced site evacuation and allowed the protesters to stay camped. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, the &quot;indignant&quot; proceeded to the occupation of a new park at the confluence of the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, linking New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the protestors, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he told Efe that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that are several hundred people which had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already has shifted in show of support to the members of the movement and that he has tried to mediate with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, Zuccotti square - which is an enclosure of private - property remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for same on Tuesday in which must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the displaced protesters up there they carried and distributed copies of the court order to these hours and even them handing over to the officers who guarded the square, causing &quot;some small clashes&quot;, said Bray, who claimed that some officers was beating the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> Court order prohibits the authorities evict members of occupies Wall Street or apply &quot;laws that were published after the start of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators again accessing the park with shops or other properties using previously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to this warrant, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to return to install with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Alderman personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of the plaza of Zuccotti, an operation in which proceeded to around 200 arrests and it was decided because the demonstrators were &quot;breaking the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was making &quot;in a place where the people came not to protest but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others&quot;, and that &quot;some businesses had received threats&quot; and residents feared &quot;for their quality of life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The eviction of this morning was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that American workers at the bottom,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the Mayor of &quot;disrespect to freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2398"> Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, it will appear in &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; television show on 1 December </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the Assistant of Tim Allen in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, Bunny &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of the musician Tommy Lee and now, actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private CTV television channel announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, appears in the TV show &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on 1 December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV today released images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video that appears along with her then husband, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot;, Tommy Lee, drummer appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as host in part of the tour &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; of Charlie Sheen, he appears as Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that is no stranger to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot;Fox&quot; to the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan is reborn after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP grows 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since last March the Japanese economy was still convalescent, paralyzed by the devastating earthquake which became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that suffered Japanese abroad since World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Early estimates of the Tokyo Government put the damage at $ 300 billion, a blow that, despite a difficult global context, appears to have been watered down. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls between July and September gross domestic product data served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - supposed, in addition, the increased pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> Recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of equipment to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies increased their investment 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures noted from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the real shock of the Japanese economy not is based exclusively on the Keynesian boost which invites you to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use gaps to grow from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan aroused, mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable climbed 1%, fueled by increased spending in vehicles, travel and leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the&quot;shelter&quot; chosen by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in the euro zone and murky forecasts of EE.UU., a privilege which weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed its weak results between July and September to the value of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While markets remain with their siege to peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lowers its guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And, indeed, the prospects aren&apos;t encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for cooperation and economic development (OECD) said that the majority of Member States submitted in September clearer signs of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator which anticipates the inflection in the global economy points emphasized that the major powers are holding back. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> That dropped four tenths up were 100.4 points, against the 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The euro zone, even stood below the average, found on the 100 level to precipitate eight tenths up 99,13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens again feed the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that adopted adjustments, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With peripheral triggered risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstated in the parquet, Greece still entangled in the maze that leads towards the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional Government hellene comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels by a genuine belief of political forces starting to confirm with facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for the structural reforms and the hundred days period agreed designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party new democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that it will not support new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated their demand for new elections to dateon 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to implement decisions of the Summit on October 26&quot;, asserted Papadimos yesterday opened a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras not clears doubts about its stance: &quot;we are committed to assist the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader went one step further in your pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will not its approval to any letter of commitment to implementation of the settings. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the referendum of Papandreou órdago, yesterday reiterated its demand is strong: not unlock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties Hellenes do not sign &quot;a compromise written without ambiguity and as soon as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman explained that the inspectors of the troika will return &quot;soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;that is needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, although there is no definite date. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek Hank still has thread for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Sofia: &quot;Are instruments for progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen stressed the &quot;mainstreaming&quot; of Spain in relation to this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has attained a prominent place globally in the role of the microfinance&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become these past two decades in the second largest donor of the posed in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; pointed out that he lives in a &quot;tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on trust in humans&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen yesterday opened the V world Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;no doubt&quot; that is kind of operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium development goals established by United Nations with Horizon 2015, and &quot;especially in one that has as its goal the reduction by half of the volume of people whose income is less a daily dollar&quot;, with which sets the &quot;poverty line&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;still working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot;responsibility&quot;, said Sofia, he hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating from the Summit, which runs until Thursday,&quot;ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women&quot;&quot;, major beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> They are &quot;many achievements&quot; and &quot;many challenges that we face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Microcredit Summit arises not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote &quot;two basic goals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, his Majesty explained that it aspires to the millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and a hundred million of these households out of the poverty line in which they are mired are 175 by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the conception of the microloans in Spain and the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path initiated way years ago pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, highlight Sofia as an &quot;Act of Justice and due recognition&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And he described the father of this tool as an &quot;Idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, whose work known 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet their lending policy on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later the first Summit in Washington and other meetings as celebrated in Côte d&apos;Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;all I have seen continuous evolution&quot;, explained his Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the epithet of the &quot;head of household&quot; having in Valladolid by the &quot;poor baquero&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by urging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic State. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this regard, he explained that a mistake would be to link cooperation with developing countries to economic good times, it is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered microcredit pose &quot;a policy serious and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty&quot;, and &quot;more than ever&quot; the Governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let this victim of cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> For its part, the Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;success&quot; to &quot;trust&quot; the people &quot;excluded who all close the doors&quot;; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that &quot;opens its doors involved the spirit of solidarity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Initially had not been included in the agenda of the future of Europe, but the topic imposed in autumn, in particular to meet the activists who believe that the Government&apos;s policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and it could be in the future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Of the 1,001 delegates, only there were nine votes against and 10 abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of finance, releasing any possible doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor &quot;has come the time to lead the way in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could manifest itself in the Lisbon Treaty changes to allow for strengthening the control of the European Union on the countries of the euro area fiscal policies, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, this is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the ball is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> On the other hand, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would clearly strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Eager to calm down inside his party, the Chancellor increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that it has tried to win over its Congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of &quot;the Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel has not mentado to France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in passing. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incidence of fraud losses by disease </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After subsidies, the UMP and Government undertake an offensive against losses due to illness. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday November 15 in Bordeaux, to visit a responsible family allowances Fund and deliver a speech on the theme, already since 2007, the fight against social fraud and the assistantship. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> In addition, to accompany such offensive, that part of the will save rigorously, but still resembles an axis of the presidential campaign of right-wing, a majority wants to focus on casualties due to illness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on workers of the private sector a fourth day of deficiency before to take down. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In short, unless there is a Convention of company specific, a worker who falls ill lose four days of salary, i.e., a minimum of 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would make it possible to save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: impose officials a day of absence without pay in the case of sick leave (so far, have no lack, compared the three days that apply in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are discussed, most again put on the table equally the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards abuses of labour losses. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Will significantly increase the controls and, in addition, if someone committing a fraud, he shall reimburse the amounts,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the field of industrial casualties. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> In fact, since 2002 performs constant monitoring of this issue and various political offensive that, usually, have borne fruit have taken. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sick than in the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> With attention, first of all, look at the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the French Institute of social security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros in benefits were paid by labour casualties. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute of research and documentation in health economics, subsidies for losses, in 2008, accounted for 5% of expenditure on health, rising to 11,300 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to casualties by maternity and accidents at work, while 54% is related to losses by disease, figure amounting to EUR 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Therefore, 2.5% of spending on health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days of sick leave, to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average which, no doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management in Monster.com, showed 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not caught a single day of baja sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, in this case the assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of casualties from disease had a duration less than 8 days, 22% aged between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take casualties due to illness. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence from work (both for health reasons and another type) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands or United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud losses due to illness is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Fraud is quite limited in scope. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to make systematic controls of the casualties due to illness of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM, 13% of the made 285.000, were found to short-term losses &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, i.e. 37.050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of losses of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, deemed that 11% of cases were &quot;properly adapted or unjustified;&quot; a figure, taking as starting a total of 1.2 million, amounting to 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Therefore, reached a total of 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot; among millions of workers who took a sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Certainly a figure insignificant in comparison, for example, with the work in black. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, the practice represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, i.e. more than the total cost of the subsidies for casualties and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this last area. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece should implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new adjustment plan to fix its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos to the Parliament; He also added that the hundred days that have been given to his Government of Union would not suffice to achieve such objective. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;For efforts that will lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our partners in Europe and a new programme of budgetary adjustment,&quot; declared the head of Government, who pronounced his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken during the Summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the &quot;primary task&quot; of the new Government, since &quot;is at stake&quot; the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> As a result, Papadémos has provided that the country&apos;s public deficit will be reduced to around 9 %&quot;&quot; of GDP before end of year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right rejected new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing group, showed Monday its support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit additional austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;Do not vote for new measures&quot;, he said during a meeting with members of his party &quot;New democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and debt, and fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and EU desbloquearían not need 8,000 million euros loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> A Committee of experts States that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians living denying death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> Canadian society lives to deny death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> In fact, only 9% of Canadians is willing to talk to your doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and take provisions to that effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It&apos;s one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Canada society, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This Committee recommends that the Government to amend the criminal code so that allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient there is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> To start, experts cite a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, comparing the quality of death in 40 countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada ranked tenth, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And while the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them has just died in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Altogether, the highest rate in this sense recorded the Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&apos;s authors reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already declared that you don&apos;t want to modify the criminal code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with not competent persons or which had not given his consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday via teleconference that, on the contrary, observed more excesses in those countries where they have not legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Canada is practised in assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal&quot;, explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians favour euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let us remember that 85% of Canadians already have spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> In addition, 66% believed that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not to understand the life of elderly or disabled people to have less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> With regard to persons who have practiced the assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed should not initiate a process against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In connection with maintaining or interruption of healthcare to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> In addition, between its recommendations suggest stated in the criminal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, is not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The Committee of experts also requested that he train health professionals must respect the fact that a patient will reject assistance at the end of his life without fear to face a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, on palliative or terminal sedation, already is widely used in Canada health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce the physical pain, is deemed to euthanasia and undergo the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Other experts expressed reservations </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Other experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to patients in terminal stage. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide&quot;, says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to the personal autonomy over any other value of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Well, now add &quot;society, there in tags and limitations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist in law Margaret Somerville health also expressed its &quot;strong opposition&quot; with regard to the conclusions of the report, which described as &quot;manifesto in favour of euthanasia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Canada society, puts into question especially the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan calls to President El Assad to leave power </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Damascus denounced a &quot;plot&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Syria is increasingly isolated </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The partisans of Bachar El Assad expressed yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Assad that, with the support of Russia, her resists and alleged that there was a &quot;plot&quot; against the country. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria neighbors, had expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Assad. </seg>

<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator which can be used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specialized in Atomic risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of science and international security (ISIS) it is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The IAEA said last week its &quot;grave concern&quot; for a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to the ISIS, based extensively on the IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear Centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamond by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, would have left the Center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamantes&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic problems of his company would have led him to get in touch, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Later, it is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a system of nuclear detonation &quot;with the help of a foreign expert, who not only was well acquainted with the technique, but who also, as reported by a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in such technology in the nuclear program military in their country of origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased 50 % </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Crimes and offences against Muslims increased nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as indicated by statistics published by the FBI on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has grown from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., increased by 49 per cent, against a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and offences anti-religion. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; has grown slightly to 6.628 cases, of which a 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, worrying that they have increased again this type of crimes and offences&quot;, highlighted the Organization of human rights Human Rights First, the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant, added the organization in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First takes long time noting that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights&quot;, adds a head of the Organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses,&quot; it adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in the reports of the police on &quot;hate crimes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The &quot;hate crime&quot; in American federal law inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Such legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation. </seg>

<seg id="2622"> Austria </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Introduction of a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The great coalition Government social democratic/Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget to reduce the public deficit and avoiding a possible degradation of the sovereign Austria Note by credit rating agencies (triple to). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It was the own social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6 per cent, a figure much higher than the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest every year&quot;, noted Democrat viceminister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria responds well to a request from the Brussels Summit countries members of the eurozone on 26 October: in it, the heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or a law with equivalent value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the &quot;German model&quot;, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not exceed every year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The goal is that by 2020 / 2021, public debt should be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> A strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threatens renewed intervention in the foreign exchange market </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday would that Japanese authorities intervene again marking the change if the yen continued to increase. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene, as did it the last time, if we see that it produces an excessive volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen amounted to reach levels close to the highs that produced the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the American currency. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has gradually gone back since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider him &quot;worth refuge&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar once again quote on Tuesday less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those who provoked the last speech. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> The dollar was trading before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, was at around 120 yen, and the euro at more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago, because it makes the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of revenue earned abroad by Japanese companies when they make it to the national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild it&quot; after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, they devastated the Tohoku (northeast) region, stressed Noda, who fear that the cost of the yen cut root the weak recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent over the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the &quot;economic foundations of Japan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (boxwood), which opened on Tuesday a two day meeting of its Council of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken &quot;adequate measures&quot;, implying that you should not expect more monetary flexibility Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> During its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emission increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) purchases of Treasury bills, leading to the 55 billion yen (519.000 million euros) the threshold of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial titles to flood the market liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> In the euro area: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> rates grow, the stock markets falter </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The risk of spread of the debt crisis still affecting European indices. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as best figures of growth in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue to grow. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and is situated 3.064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The Dax lost in Frankfurt 0.4 per cent and London by 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;Taking into account the new tensions in relation to the returns on loans in the euro area States most affected, stock markets around the world are still paying part of their recent profits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;Nervous investors are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent, renewing concerns of the auditors of the market in relation to Europe&apos;s ability to contain the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, have their eyes firmly on Europe and exchanges will be continued in a reduced margin of variations, so that investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,&quot; considers Mitsushige Akino, Manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management funds. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The reappearance of the concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday. </seg>

<seg id="2662"> Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6 % </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Credit Italy and Spain rates remain very worrisome levels. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> On Tuesday morning, Italian obligations 10 years performance amounted to 6.85%, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions in relation to rates of interest of the countries of the South, also of France, are still fueling the fears of the external auditors. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time to markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of choking off the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, meanwhile said that the implementation of decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the &quot;principal work&quot; of his Government. </seg>

<seg id="2670"> Waiting for the figures for growth of the euro area </seg>
<seg id="2671"> From the statistical point of view, France has registered a growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e., a figure more favorable than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> In addition, the fourth quarter is which really worries economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, for its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> It provided the first forecasts for the euro area as a whole at 11 a.m., once the European Commission has warned of the risk of renewed recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts must assert more than dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is an issue that cannot be treated taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and the cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is right that an electoral encounter is time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only be useful if it examines the set of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must be based his opinion on objective facts, in rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographics will be duplication of electricity before 2050 demand, unless a huge share of the world&apos;s population are deprived of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, will have to address the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Why, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case or Belgium, submitted his to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, Switzerland, which only aims build generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, are proceeding with determination with their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its Park, returning to the construction of a central interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, based on renewable energy, occurs occasionally as an example, the reality goes against such speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will be a rising electricity prices, increased energy dependency by the increased need for imported gas, in particular of Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, notice the harmful effects. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> You must meditate on the case of Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe in the wind sector, which gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the flashing of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbors paid a 40% higher than the French household electricity bill. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, French businesses benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which erode realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> It&apos;s a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, as polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Largely export-oriented, it includes a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create jobs not relocatable. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros per year in French exports of equipment and nuclear services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What an electrician would be an EPR designed to work sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is expected? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miracle of electricity production source, as there is a diabolical source. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva of solutions with low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary character of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have a security authority that exercises a strict and transparent control on the construction of Flamanville both existing power stations. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams of acknowledged professionalism, are also obsessed by security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one of Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; not caused consequences for people or the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some unforgivable human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of a scope unprecedented, that caused the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Thanks to these developments and cooperation between security authorities and operators and French and German builders, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While studied it all electric stakeholders who wish to build a power station, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since would leave them via free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvering dominasen such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation in our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The politics of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed &quot;country of human rights&quot; of France status. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, is administrative harassment of foreign students which has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on May 23) proclaiming of past that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> However, rarely analysed from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The issue is that, on this subject, there is enough consensus between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidance stating in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country which has nearly two million migrant workers&quot;, while on the left, the tone set what Michel Rocard, explaining that France &quot;cannot be responsible for all the misery in the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, both the left and right shared fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden for French economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of generosity that act with respect to immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include platitudes, indicating that co-development will allow to solve the &quot;problem of migration&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps profitable electorally, but get economically very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As point Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron economists in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration on economic growthwages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limitation of immigration growth weakens and is detrimental to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can be substituted for domestic workers, in particular to low-skilled, pressing to reduce their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly exercising professions in sectors with lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country having lack of anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants leads to the arrival of the latter to influence positively on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migrant flows is a rise in real wages in the long term a 0.6-0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And, without taking into account the fact that diversity that bring immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel Prize winners and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Immigrants also are net contributors to social systems, since they provide from about 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> For example, the International Labour Organization estimated that in Germany an immigrant arriving at an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average during their lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find the points of growth that lacked &quot;with teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These teeth, dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, need you just to think in a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember this since, although he invented in Athens for more than two thousand years, the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of world war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust and the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain to Portugal Salazar, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some perhaps believed that democracy flourished definitely on their enemies, would enough to vote and the most direct way possible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, from Napoleón &quot;little&quot;, that it was something designed. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, but it is a necessary condition for democracy, not only is sufficient in itself and even can become a &quot;tool of oppression&quot;, as formerly said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control powers, an education, lights, solidarity, economic and social justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but is about to become a political and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The verdadero-falso Greek referendum Palinode effect, in this regard, double revealing: showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of impossibility, of his inconsistency. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> You must reflect on this ambivalence to bridged. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front of the democratic battle lines have now moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers already not move in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We leave not winning if we demand a succession of national referendums organised in function of the needs and disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A signature white the absolute European monarch or a high vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we don&apos;t want to get shock effect, but a common exercise of full right, quiet and continuous, of choices and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (would in fact not know where end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The whole of Europe is which folds to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, that he suffers from his impotence and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The whole of Europe is which suffers humiliation in the international arena. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but is all over Europe which slowly lost sovereignty and, with it, each of their Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regain the helm of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because only together can Europeans reduced the weight of its debts, free markets and prepare for their future through investment. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level to not be taken without democratic legitimacy total, unless it is to lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After having struggled for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, worldwide currently calls for a European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think therein without further political and democratic integration, and be experienced as such by the citizens, it would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new phase of European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To build the France Republic, it was necessary to &quot;do&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains applicable. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe more integrated from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> You can only be building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To build Europe, let us Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Cards with chip &quot;contactless&quot; generalize </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The world of chip cards trade fair starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, close to Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In fact, the year 2011 should finalize with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to estimates by the Eurosmart Cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows to pay transport in common or purchases simply bringing the card to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Will this year be sold worldwide 460 million cards with contactless chip, 320 million more than the previous year! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Its share should continue in 2012 (is provided for 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for cards with chip (6,925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe, which has long behind on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the sector of contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Around 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, its beginnings are modest: 400,000 Visa Contactless cards are being used. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But supermarkets are working for four. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard card. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To put the upper March, however, it is necessary that banks implement available to its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;There are two big French establishments committed themselves to disseminate systematically in the future, among its clients, bank cards equipped with contactless system,&quot; Announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks tested the payment by mobile phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But only constitutes a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable for the transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They are stuck&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But it should finally experiencing a real boom next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We expect that they will be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But banks take the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The Bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Equipped the iPhone around 200 clients and partners with a cover that allows contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the commercialisation of an offer allowing customers to pay without contact via your mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which suspected for some time, have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even argued that Algiers already &quot;has certainty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,&quot; said, without providing further details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the next day along with several of his captors during an operation launched by French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, Nigerian and French researchers found several phone chip belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The study of the calls made pointing several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in Northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man that is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It&apos;s progress, but certainly we should expect to have more formal tests before you speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We know from years ago that the sect enjoys foreign financial and intellectual support and that is increasingly more active&quot;, says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> These past months, those &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in their operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikaze or more complex explosive devices with the same style as those used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, is since then pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A quick success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri on a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), encourages the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> This poor region, the Association is experiencing a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It politicized and requires a strict Sharia compliance, while their militants are released to the fight against the impious central Government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The latter are aimed firstly at churches, bars, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and multiplied attacks on police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuja was, as usual, widespread. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army attacked the city and there were 800 dead. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the sect was radicalizing and abandoned their strongholds of the North. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> The past Christmas, claimed an attack that causes 80 killed in Jos, and then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, Boko Haram returned to attack against Abuja, in particular against the protected with a suicide attack, the police headquarters, the first of its kind. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist shaft in Africa, covering from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is concerned about all the security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While that Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al - Chebab Somalis operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the Centre of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned him against Boko Haram and has stated that he was willing to &quot;share information&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to Republican candidates for the Presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> Compared with China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates increasingly make more loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Extend the slogans, often infundamentados, China, Iran, Israel help. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the candidate better situated in the race to the nomination by the &quot;Grand Old Party, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and Sue&quot;by manipulating its currency&quot;, a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> No matter if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns an attitude that &quot;overwhelms&quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He has asked a firm, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which remains mired in the depths of the polls, is still inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Reagan-style </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised an intervention military in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I leave elected, stop Iran,&quot; fanfarroneó. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed its obligations in connection with that partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Businessman Herman Cain, the second candidate ranked, for its part shows a shameful ignorance of such topics. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, called to counter Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;seeks to develop nuclear capacity&quot;, apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the atom military since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is prepared to deploy the army in Mexico in the fight against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, it also advocate Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> There are considerable differences with 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that won the cold war. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Remember that the own Obama was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist, rightly, the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and often labeled it weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attacks are not simple. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population judged the balance of national security Obama, which ended with Bin Laden in a rather positive way. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> From Iraq, he become weary of military interventions that generate a collapse. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And arguing that you we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, new gateway of the Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly Western Europe with Russia passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been in service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> You must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the Orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister François Fillon French and his counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in Western Europe network have revolved together. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, each year reach 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional Western Europe through a first had of 1,224 km that connect the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012 which allow you to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e., sufficient to cover all French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> In addition, talk is of the possibility of constructing a third tube by the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion time of this huge work presents victory aires. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the Baltic countries had been strongly opposed to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, Nord Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the Earth course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries lost some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to close access to the markets of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw had no hesitation in comparing Nord Stream as a &quot;new compact German-Soviet&quot;, referring to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin to deal with Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, supporting the Russian project has obtained greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has created a gap between the East and the West Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has, in just five years, do succeed his vision of a direct partnership between Russia and Western countries rich, large consumers of gas and with more limited reserves. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing to what extent large contracts for the gas sector are as political as economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The undersea tube is made of steel covered with cement to protect against the anchors of vessels. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It relies on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m of depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It was also necessary to intensify the measures for the protection of fauna and flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal which weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: valves, nor maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control in the waters of Sweden platform was planned, but those responsible for the project renounced it to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow that a society State Russian be established permanently in the sea off its coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the event of breakdown, means the passage of gas in less than a minute&quot;, accurate Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of leakage, gas from the pipeline be released, therefore, into the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But builders consider it unlikely that produce an escape, because they have provided for joints which, according to forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The State of the pipeline control is guaranteed through a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which conducts field inspections, as well as a device that circulates through the interior of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Shaped like a cigar, it enters the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline has been designed to work for 50 years without any kind of repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The movement of the gas is guaranteed just by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> At the beginning is of 200 bars and out of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> She joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It is headquartered in German, Switzerland, where enforcement is especially favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Later, Gazprom leased to the society, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of the capabilities of gas transportation. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay by the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported&quot;, accurate Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been just 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% through bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are confident that will not exceed your investment, because Gazprom assumes only the risk of costs alone. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pines. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> A few valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are a few sensors that measure pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before that you transfer to German pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Total capacity, shall be three million per hour and in 2012, six million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a brand book. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people taste by writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is recognized easily, with their black rectangular pasta, rubber, their white broken, as ageing by the time sheets. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current aspect... born in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company mode mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, the mole (Mole skin) skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This kind of book was very appreciated by the writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has been adapted to current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; has Maria Sebregondi, which since then became responsible for the brand in mode mode. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> And it achieved success. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Far has been confidential production from the early years, in which 3,000 books only were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and worship. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which consisted of twelve workers in its early days, now has nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> Distributes their books in libraries, from Fnac until the small shops in the center of the cities, and it has been able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of the mails&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists exposed his own notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it also released a notebook with tapas of Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Building on its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of media. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that provokes envy: in autumn of 2006, mode mode was acquired by the investment SG Capital Europe Fund, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Is the unemployment rate of disabled workers why still so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of persons with disabilities, they are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> 15Th week for the employment of disabled persons begins today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a public policy resolved, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled twice the average rate: 19%, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Disappointing? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No,&quot; says Eric Blanchet, director-general of Adapt, the Association which organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;Progress for fifteen years are substantial.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, there is still a lot to do&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed still face numerous obstacles to access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They tend to have a more advanced age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% is not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I.e., there are numerous issues hindering the return to the world of work especially and which &quot;constitute the crux of the problem&quot;, says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to hire disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> These are the objective obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mindset of the people is moving, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the IMS – Entreprendre for la Cité Association indicated that surveyed managers have &quot;a level of knowledge about disabilities low&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of persons&quot; in wheelchair, poor physical or intellectuals. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result: companies with more than 20 workers are a far cry from the objective of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, objective that was set in a law of... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now reached about 3 %&quot;, says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof: the number of &quot;subject to this contribution&quot; establishment, as well as the margin amounts have declined between 2007 and 2011, passing 59.000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated pressure for companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, in particular among large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of labour, only 59% of companies possessing between 20 and 49 employees has disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82% of companies between 100 and 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;A joy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> About to face the Bleus on Tuesday evening (20 h 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens don&apos;t hide the pleasure that generates them this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We dare not say that collusion among them noticed, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting one next to the other, at the podium of the Auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really have made peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the gesture of bitterness of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach had only praise for him. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I was much delighted by Eden, by their progress and because it is Belgian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to move forward,&quot; he tells Lille striker. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As for the contrast between their presentations on your computer and in the selection, &quot;is a set&quot;, it has been justified. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille, I am throughout the year, which does not apply to Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;I have to be me&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, &quot;shine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without forgetting the &quot;pleasure&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> Has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I have always been your fan,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Without doubt, it will especially strengthen the &quot;special&quot; nature of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Especially because it will face &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot;, recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We just face recently.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Always play against them is a joy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to the &quot;pride&quot; for its part. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; by &quot;A gala match&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; by check as a &quot;neighbor&quot;, that France &quot;again be a very high-level team&quot;, about a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; he said with enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to share aircraft with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our Belgian children are growing,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We are building something;&quot; the players are ambitious, hungry. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You can see it in the next matches.&quot; Including the match against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal shows confidence </seg>
<seg id="2985"> The Portugal of Paulo Bento is facing the return game against Bosnia (22 h 00), to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> In the match of round, lacked realism to both teams. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;When within these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento as seen in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, that defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Taking into account the Party of ida (0-0), the hell of Zenica Friday, it seems clear that the thing was not determined. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, Yes, but could not dial the valuable goal that would have given him tranquility. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;This is a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in the bright light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that will pass, before an audience that should be equally excited, even if it is clear that the party &quot;is tight,&quot; dixit a Bento optimistic but lucid. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We hope that the game is tight, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,&quot; said the Portuguese coach of 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;Still have 50% of opportunities to participate in the Euro 2012&quot;, has, however, relativized the successor to Carlos Queiroz. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The draw on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and to win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> The Bosnians they could become a tie, although they also need to mark. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;This is a good result, but at the same time carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home,&quot; he regretted Bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We are going to play against a team that possesses a high technical quality and provides players with a high quality individual,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the outset, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not allow them time to think&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, always that, this time, is realistic. </seg>
