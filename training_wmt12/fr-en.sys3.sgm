<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in an amendment to the criminal law, the proposed cancellation of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="3"> MEPs have denied in the second reading of the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ruling is not final, and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymosenko describes the judgment of revenge in the political system and caused a process of suspicion of bias of the court, also in the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 MPs. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over. </seg>

<seg id="13"> As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The interim National Council decreed the usual right of Sharia law and we already know what it is. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya is a country without crime because a flight is cut. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women can forget emancipation, not any friendly dela faith are punishable by the death penalty... </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is the Koran, which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of opposing tribes. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Libya reigns such an order as we cannot represent and we would certainly not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively better and probably would not be beneficial to the Libyan. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted assistance with recognition of infidels dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the greatness in each attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When it is, therefore, to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not one </seg>
<seg id="23"> We have participated in the shooting, served Islam and our poilitiques walked away from the dictator as a political ally without brings no benefit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is no problem for the premises to get rid of &quot;crusaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> What occupation without soil, oil companies will have access to the libyien black gold. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Perhaps not as much and the West can finally boast a desintéressée protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If we prevent these followers of Sharia law. </seg>

<seg id="77"> Feeding an obese child: takes no breakfast and takes deli for lunch </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9-13 problems of overweight, 9% of écoliersont weight above the average and 5 percent are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As the research shows the current obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This again shows how important the environment in which human beings and models that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children example deli 50% more often than in the families of children in the normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of obese had fries for dinner, according to the survey conducted with outreach &quot;obesity is not an accident&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> Families of small big sport is also a habit, which is now the most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week, parents found the time for the movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Investigation of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 pupils of primary schools in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &quot;obesity is not a coincidence,&quot; sustained action by the General Health Insurance and Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> From the beginning it is more than 12000 students from sixth to third who have registered for this project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or obese, is the lack of proper food and not enough physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half the children interviewed notes, for example, eat five times a day breakfast event - breakfast, lunch, dinner, which is a basic principles of good nutrition,&quot; says one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and lunch deli </seg>
<seg id="91"> Specialists draw attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development must be a few basic details such as a breakfast family at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students &apos; families eat at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families, everyone takes his breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst thing that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is a good daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey showed that families of obese children consume more often unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drink every day sugary drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> More than 40% of children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Prepares you your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the investigation has allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls 13 schools) to prepare its own food from proposed options according to their own taste and their personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far in terms of healthy eating, the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite dishes, there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The most alarming is particularly great preference for sweet lemonades,&quot; is shown in the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch it is pasta who took first place just before the white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The children did not want any starch and preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Focus on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits when they receive the ad hoc information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;During a control group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the meeting&quot; obesity is not a coincidence, &quot;we have attended a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet,&quot; indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most prominent was for example with regard to the sweet lemonades because children have begun to give preference to water consumption. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and reduce the sweet dishes and &quot; knedliky (Czech spécialté pellets flour bread or potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In an article presentation on how to learn for the designers, I put a little angry that there were many from the start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I did not think what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The three presentations of professional specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> We are approaching the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays, it is really packed. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the director Alenka (there is no boy) treaty on how to dress a woman who has no standard measurements. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has a small neck, another boy, without specific curve, another overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer must know how optically ammenuiser wide arm, prolonging a neck or add necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrived to emphasise nicely the character and also not to dress too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips delivered and a thin size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is such a difference between the waist and hips so that skirts or trousers are not at all, it is worth to be done. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you won&apos;t regret it because the clothing that falls neatly is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a tailored skirt you feel much better than in the slides permanently billows and does not take the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a style of clothing Tucker, with tissue stitched or embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Obviously there are many examples of various appearances and I am pleased that I have all week to sort all information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also fear that what I am supposed to do at home, there is too much. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion personality as well as his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will have to &quot;dress up&quot; Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you are familiar with the campaign the Victoria Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At the bottom of me, I am pleased, because it is better than to dress up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who took almost one hundred kilograms lately (don&apos;t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the Internet, print and work the graphics. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard, as they say on the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Also reflect on the graphic portion of the styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The designer dress does not only physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, designer and artist, has maintained all of this. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But this... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer must have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three guests of the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the meeting on Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka designer fashion and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talented designer knows work with a single dress differently. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is for this important example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As for example the trench-coat which must be worn classic with jeans and a T-shirt as a light coat but it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and photo as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or it is enough to trace the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;With this,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I especially appreciated the following advice: &quot;for the work you need to know what the rules are perfectly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You can then begin to break it,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why it is trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, whereas in fashion magazines, sometimes you see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have much more variants of clothing than those photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That is to say that fashion story that will have a dozen pages (and hence a dozen models) I must be ready to &quot;retailler&quot; at least a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with it during a creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer, but his image and marketing have made it a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of designers still remains cautious. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, but what I appearance is second). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone is a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that we, with a high degree of probability dictates a completely different (smaller) than it has in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We have then to sail on google and ascertain whether the news of Boulevard show celebrity, if she has lost weight or swollen etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to navigate fashion and assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> He must communicate with the people he dressed and it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Knowing guess people not flatter, keep his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and meet new elements you can&apos;t throw everything and say, My God horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find some cases that you will find pretty and you conseillerez with the bear,&quot; said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us practically everything must contain the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or designer bag. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is the one you hang around the waist and you on itself for everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to the clearly defined things like scissors, dépilation rolls or pins to nurse, there is also the nylon thread (that the designer used to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which closes a garment in the back, if it is too big (or other type of clasp are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For that we are not just people who listen but who tried something practical way we were taught how to properly ressemeller shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaging, especially. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we are stuck, and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We did not have the right to receive the scissors to not inadvertently hurt. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is therefore truly skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The jurisdiction of which I am a state is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we have learned during the second weekend courses </seg>
<seg id="178"> I start increasingly understand that styling profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The need for speed The Run competes across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Revision </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without a problem becomes a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it is no use if nobody wants to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new party subtitled The Run produced great expectations before his exit. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with the race series Need for Speed already old and break a game from jouables parties which would not only with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> So we were curious how the passages will be added during which the main hero fate of his car and does what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As already happens in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what we atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> These are potentially running games arcades, but the whole derives downwards because of a few unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> They are not really errors but rather an expression of an incomprehensible idleness of the developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has emotional problems and solve them to participate in illegal racing across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting points. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten steps and then more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> The result is that each race on a different route and steps in different environments that differ quite well with each other and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player did not feel a moment that the game offered something similar. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are also quite nice even if the technical level chart is the same type as the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally, this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are more from time to time with an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm you significantly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche you cannot fall. </seg>
<seg id="202"> However the different races are tidily one behind the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There is only a small number, but that is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are moments you strive to surpass the number requested adversaries (as in a classic race) and then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time you also police entering the game and trying to make the situation reportedly rarely. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty is the passages out vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Rather, it is interactive animation una when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you must help by banging on the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type that what you want (to be concrete, there were only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> The result is this because this element will not hamper and place within the context described above, the elements that make up the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but we cannot say that this is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> With regard to the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But while one can find better in the conccurrence model of conduct goes very well with the type of design races. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So everything is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems begin to appear after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The diffférence model of conduct, the collision is not yet ready. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We do not expect this game a complicated and deformation of collisions, but when you are not in a collision with any object, the slightest idea how behaves your car, so this is not completely fit. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During the tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car share in voltiges mad. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or is in tatters. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to restart system that is not really a problem, but it really upsets. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The recovery is so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the decor, the game takes you back to the time of the last item on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you have not only 5 reboots. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you have used the 5 reboots you need to start the game from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is more a tool, if something is not happening, here on which you can really count. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes the reboots do not help, and we must find a solution in remémorrant memory the piece of itinerary. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The major fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example, there are some turns that we need to move a certain way otherwise does not pass. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you meet on a given location &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles still in the same configuration you conclude first, fifth, advanced 5 seconds or a minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What angry are the situations when you see easily pass the adversary between two cars oncoming and when you arrive, you, you must either be put aside and conturner or curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is equal if you go to him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; in such a way that the situation it is always very close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents have other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you always have the same adversary above you in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This irritates the most end when you go on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The enemy must pass in front of you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When he goes before you hide the sight of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter collided many times. </seg>
<seg id="237"> It is understandable that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a shame, because through a simple conduct model of the game is interesting and places with action that you do not have the time to monitor everything that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the racing is such that there is no chance to be bored or something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change of car during races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must pay attention to gasoline pumps on routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Sports cars are ideal for cities, big-engined American for straight highways and super sports cars to exotic garb on highly technical led by example on the switchback roads in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And the mode of challenges, which are racing in particular places you know adventure goes very well with the main scheme in history. </seg>

<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super. </seg>
<seg id="253"> The discomfort is that in more extreme situations, imagery is not the level and in some cases dramatically. </seg>

<seg id="276"> Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot; The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions &apos; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I did not expect such a harsh war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will take 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role,&quot; as well as Miléna Vicenova began his presentation at the Law Faculty of the Czech ambassador near the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="281"> When she was able to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University might envy, it has shown how it takes its motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe&quot; very seriously. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;From the outset resounded criticism that it is bland, that it is a round-of-leather, that it cannot rempplir any mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everybody because it takes its role to perfection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;This is a man who listens to 27 member states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> She said the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy within the framework of an answer to the question: &quot;who is that the European Union?&quot; &quot;what phone number do I call?&quot; As an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of EU policy states, such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked that feels very strong) </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that has lived lives and live in a time near the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="288"> She called the Czech presidency two years of success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czech have solved the growing financial crisis, the gas crisis or hosted a summit for Oriental Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She called the fall of the Government very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of Madam Ambassador, &quot;activity has beaten its full&quot; not only for the presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved again now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> It must approve the new septimal EU budget which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> As it would appear that the budget will be thin and savings, what branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Madam Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels for a Europe that is understandable. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot; I definitely don&apos;t like the abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As must understand the citizens that it is true that in Brussels no rings or twisted gherkins, bananas differemment large or that nobody has forbidden to syrecky. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="298"> She wants to make better use of the EU&apos;s environment and see more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> A multi-speed Europe awaits us </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who do not see things in their more negative than positive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> It is sorry to see if a small Czech representation in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is the result, according to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="303"> A Czech presidency success then stressed the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot; Believe me, when come to me the Poles, the Magyar, Slovak, French said to me: &apos; Wow, what is that you are there, that is still the Visegrad group? &quot; And it is not at all happy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future are new tough rules on budgetary policy that await the member countries. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, which prevails rather than a &quot;new European Federation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the euro zone and other outside of the area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> First it was said that cooperation among the countries that want it and those who do not wish to remain in their corner. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be a lot of institutes of this type, and there will be a Europe really two-speed,&quot; expects Mrs Vicenova. </seg>
<seg id="311"> From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis under which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not just the memebres in the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> History of a mark: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone should seek the word expresses closer to the IBM strategy, the closest would be &quot;the long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and yet since its creation it has passed 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long-term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He has left this slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its slogan &quot;PENSE!&quot; Became the imprint that life is going to develop a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> For us, IBM means thinking long-term continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived 100 years thanks to the fact that she always remained true to its core values, however, has not been afraid to change all the others around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This has helped us during our first century transforming technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more &quot; délaré for the anniversary, the current director of the firm, Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A well-prepared system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM were the only one of the first American employees have paid vacation, an employer-paid insurance plus a uniform elegant employee and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Similarly, IBM has a system of relationships with the client well developed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talent, as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have a choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since it will be a woman, Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The latter worked at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is what is called the jamy, brain-storming online from what are far from future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - the firm nearly 500000 people who work. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is the internal and external image of the company to ensure a secure position in the areas of business. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the beginning, IBM had a concept rather institution as a technology firm,&quot; said drawing, Professor of Economics at the School of Economics at Harvard and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technlogique firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the world of business, using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the firm itself, there is a difference between entering the market and create this market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;big Blue,&quot; as it is called familiarly in the United States with regard to its slogan, in 100 years it has grown to become one of the largest global companies. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services Council at the level of the server products up to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his discoveries stands, for example, the distributor of tickets, the payment card, the swap, the bar code or the disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM has been this year with $220 billion, the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996, Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview in advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> It is not all innovations and workmanship that took customer preference and IBM - for example, has failed the bet on its own operating system OS/2, Prodige online service or the IBM computer PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;When your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain ensconced on the past,&quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> For this, IBM has no problem to build bases on many platforms and when they do not operate it. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike example conccurent Microsoft at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the IBM revenue services, which are trained to a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Yet in 1990 it was more of the highest motié participation representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion over cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology prospects. </seg>
<seg id="351"> She continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It now appears that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The share price IBM has progessé from 2008 rocket 120 percent, net income for the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The company&apos;s logo IBM is to change everything, but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> We can expect to this flexible giant tightening other crises. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: from the cheese slices to flights in the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="358"> IBM (IBM) was born in New York City 100 years ago; it was originally the complicated Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the 19th century. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They had technologies such as the &quot;old pointeuses&quot; clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Council of surveillance society. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The leader was then shade to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the firm kusqu&apos; in 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - cheese slicers and meat until the cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years in which Watson led the turnover of redoubled to reach 9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was the firm if irreplaceable after 40 years of leadership is his son who occupied the director, Thomas Watson Jr. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> People in the 1960s and the IBM computers helped NASA has guided flights in the cosmos - Mercury, Saturn and theft in 1969 on the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The PC classic hastened the standard computer era with the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM sells its manufactures computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy succeeds in IBM over the past three years - is the concept Smarter Planet &quot;a smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its goal is uilisation smart technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and management of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In terms of trade area IBM has developed shortly a platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; that helps the commercial manager throughout the business cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history also on our territory. </seg>
<seg id="378"> She set up its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first country of Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno. </seg>

<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: this affects you too? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to determine typical vices of women, like the others, are able to get out of their game. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear, you are going to see in the following lines of female vices arriving to pump blood veins of men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Should you buy at least one garment per week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are simply buying and packages at the time of the balances? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case you can talk about shopping as a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you will say, which seems to browsing clothing stores, look for yourself nice clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And while most women buy a hobby, it can become a real hell for humans. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Remember just how many times have you told your spouse waiting at the entrance... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Continuing dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too big?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start doing sport?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;I like you?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These phrases you recall not something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> You are part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> This is not the question that you should stop it yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints are rising and more women are becoming empoisonnantes. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The disclosure and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is like an infinite. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Wash the windows, vacuuming, clean soil, dust, strip the bathroom - and twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the sink, fouling the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> If you suffer precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that we should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can spoil your relationships and even the family. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The work of undermining </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;This tracksuit spent in the dustbin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You put these old socks again tomorrow?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;A wet towel has nothing to do by land.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you do this undermining your partner in this way several times a day, you are going to really break down. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It is clear that you do not harm you want everything to be impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps if the men knew the women would not have to do so undermined... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Defamation, persiflage </seg>
<seg id="439"> Defamation, persiflage but insults against someone are also own some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are particularly brought relations and are happy to address issues like that, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps we are missing a small harmless persiflage here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on heart, yet it is a peculiarity of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those who advise, persiflent even despise each other and their entourage - particularly at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory in Philadelphia during the match NHL Monday on the ice of Caroline and again at the top of the Czech players productive for the competition. </seg>
<seg id="446"> From the perspective of the star of 39 years, Claude Giroux, who still made a pass and was named the best player of the match, it was in both cases. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Jakub Voracek, which plays with Jagr has also recorded two goals during the match. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr after the match said journalists overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening. </seg>

<seg id="450"> &quot;I felt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes this feeling you fall over,&quot; said Jagr after Giroux action marked a goal of the first Flyers fire. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second attack on the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the goals for the Hurricanes palet and presented to striker Maxime Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a raid, but the beginning of the second part served the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Concrete Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr scored the three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I don&apos;t want to say that it is the best player in the league, but it really is part of the three best,&quot; said Jagr about its centre. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I never thought I jouerais at the end of their career with a hokeyjiste like him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am really pleased with it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All these years the other players in the NHL team tried to play on me, now it is my turn,&quot; said Jagr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Caroline was a tragedy of this game with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and new Dwyer on a penalty shooting ends with a difference of a goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read has not ruled out other complications that ended by two to one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot; He banged on the palet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage. </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to hit and I arrived,&quot; describes the last goal of the match from her point of view Voracek. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The Candiens did not face an experienced defender ahead of two butset lost after a fire pénalty by 2: 3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomas Plekanec has transformed none of their attacks. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is the fact that the rear line was sick with an embarrassment to the local entraineur rather than points lost because they played the game with only five defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;It is zero.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing to do, it is like that,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacement replacement on this was not enough and we have not been able to resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had just to simplify the game, pushing the palet outside our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> For this we had limits, &quot; said one of the defenders P.K. Subban. </seg>

<seg id="481"> How prices have changed travel since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agents at that time offered travel mainly in the country&apos;s socialist bloc, because travel to the west were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists traveled to holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination towards the west, and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialist era was that he was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In cases where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation or the individual trip was not permitted. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after that it was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the currency was the condition for travel to the west was denied to &quot;politically incorrect&quot; people who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czechs spend their vacations more often in the country where there was therefore many houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and usually lasts until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travel Czechs have since undergone a major revolution since 1989. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum, the Czechs have spent the past year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox of which we have no conscience today is that the most popular is Croatia when it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria in Vienna and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could not long travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, Paris travel organizations were sleeping Czechs in tents in parks because our income we could not pay the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical feature of Czechs was at that time to win with its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna has enabled our tourists finally after decades of power freely buy Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living as well as the average salary rose causing around 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with links by charter air through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with almost most developed countries around the world to the US later facilitated our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, when was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as every year, direct air charter take of Czech tourists in distant hot countries; this winter, there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries every year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Still an interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the EU has abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to stand completely in the group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15000 kronor per person for holidays abroad including annexes loads. Kroner per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President but may be terminated by a situation without &quot;solution&quot; pat </seg>
<seg id="511"> Nearly 5mois already Czech football without President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after yet another General Assembly to be held Thursday at Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> However, there is still no agreement on what to vote must proceed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Dr. Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hašek football came back to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was completely shown on September 16 when he had to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked and it has not even been discussed to address how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly only - apparently, the statutory representatives or also those with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment also with the support of the Office for the state and the law, under which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Differences continue about the rules for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiation has contributed nothing to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> Opinions on the voting possibilitě have changed several times, but the key point is always the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid falling into the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model,&quot; was one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the planned model won the third round of candidates who have received the most votes in percentage terms in the chamber for which he is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes of the two chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech Republic is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept,&quot; admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian party and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to existing statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agree even if he believes that the electoral rules established by statute advantage Pelta among all the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I hope that the vote under the statutes of the association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;There is still no insane ideas dreamt up by a representative as during the past general assemblies,&quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and in its submissions has defined mainly against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification today in European Championships should calm everybody.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football on a wave of happiness and one more more joy for cooperation,&quot; added the officer Jablonec which of the three has the greatest experience of leadership of both professional football and regionally. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends in wanting to change the design regulations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This can lead to a new blockage at the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope that the sound reason will win,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time for a joint agreement to all parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some réuunions should be held directly in Montenegro but who can say whether the entire direction of football will be full for the match. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The specially chartered flight in which to travel up to Podgorice among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not taken off for technical reasons and was looking for an alternative to take part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Education Minister of Youth and Sport Dobes Joseph would be very happy to receive the parties torn within the sports association, the largest in the country and bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there is a lot: a state appropriation, the credibility of football and the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union should determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik goes to battle for the position of President because he saw no correct candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of footballers Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to what it calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not campaign for this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If such a candidate is I support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such a candidate,&quot; said Paclik the Czech News Agency (KTC). </seg>
<seg id="552"> The Paclik motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Dr. Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to head the AFRT which in principle would be favourite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik also stresses that if it was awarded the elections it would hold the post of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> He would see in an experienced manager function and high-level but is not linked with the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I talked with people who have the profile,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was terrible when some have told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change that image,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What, they say, especially Paclik embarrassment, it is the relationship between Pelta and President of the EU&apos;s regional Plzen Roman Berbr football, to the controversial reputation who is known in the wings as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates &apos; General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of Berbr, a shopkeeper in top flight, it would be even less favourable to football,&quot; proclaimed Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was delivered a few years during eavesdropping as part of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta emerged without any penalty. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what Pelta prestige would be football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we be viewed in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club Plzen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In cases where Paclik would win the vote on Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, which was completed by a fiasco, think the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great abilities&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;It would be able to stand for example as head of the representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as manager of the Association, it would not be capable of.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose in what I do not know,&quot; said Paclik in September has attracted much attention when he has called for the cancellation of the arbitrators with Ludek Macela has replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik argues that it would be at the level to lead the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> He takes his abilities as an example to lead private firms and also leads since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support in May of last year&apos;s triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I freinerais the influence of some interested groups, for example, have a tendency to affect the Disciplinary Commission and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; said Paclik who do not chache his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power lobby with high-level policy would get for sport more tax money on the games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key points that the new President should address.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;It is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not take its current association with the club Plzen as something negative, even though he himself says that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above the parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> I see no reason to convey my actions club Plzen to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later, &quot; said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT should put an end to situations of pat. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association a candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the disputes about the rules for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official Jablonec is prior to the meeting on Thursday at Nymburk very optimistic that the success today of the representation of football should alleviate this squabble before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election in September, which was not carried out promised precisely to devote themselves to national representation and obtaining financial means if he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He has decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present in a broad context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels of football for a long time and expect Thursday there is a President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association,&quot; he says, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> That is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, the General Assembly June statutes were approved that were not perfect as all have seen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there were not all these various interprétattions we would already had a president since September,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the full attention of the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become, I take it as a personal mission and am prepared to take all the responsibility where it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; added Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said previously that he can cooperate with Dr. Jindrich Rajchl he recognises with regard to his training in law and he knows that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It has not attacked long Tonas Paclik rather don&apos;t criticize Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It is evolving in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Its attacks, however, were not the most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;This is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; said Pelta to his opponent, but still, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon was his knowledge of football from competitions of lowest level until the National Corporate Representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a vitirne of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I am also efforcerais finish all cases that begin with the Bohémians or following the corruption scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I would be entering immediate negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for football,&quot; said the Czech News Agency KTC 46th candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also added that his appointment to head the football would bring no change. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should get acquainted with all employees,&quot; he said at Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will surpass.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and it will be when there is a new leader,&quot; as says optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot; If the current president Dr. Jindrich Rajchl is elected President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people, it appears. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, however, that in cases where it would be elected it will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to settle the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make football more money and continue the work begun by his predecessor Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful football for youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I am not saying that I will do all this alone,&quot; said Rajchl in an interview for KTC. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is responsible for a specific area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will distribute difficult missions for football face a big step forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people will not be happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticising others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> He noted, it is said, that he would not stand again as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;About me, it is known that I am working 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know if it is worth and whether I will have people behind me that I will constantly spanner in the works and will emit doubts about each of my actions,&quot; explaining why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people have even said that I should not abandon because they would also.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is a confidence that I cannot betray,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates them, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Over the last two years there has been a great job and I do not want to let him down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stops. &apos;,&quot; he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the European Union comes back as it was before Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic work, and that is something that Mirek Pelta don&apos;t know.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are people who fairaient football so that it would be only for those who have been chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;You can accuse me a number of things, but certainly not bear somebody.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I am trying to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot; I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not just those who have been chosen </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms once again that it would be only a President for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do its utmost to Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is the time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian whose winners are left in the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot; There would be no situation now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is to find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances of winning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I sense an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber and was elected Vice President and knows that with me there will be success,&quot; said Rajchl contemplating among its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating contracts with televisions and the Gaming Act. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he said about &quot;Pelta he is disqualified because with the Czech footblal would lose its credibility,&quot; he believes that the second Paclik adversary is a strong candidate to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can doubt in Plzen he has done a superb job this year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If elected, he would surely continue in what has been started by Hašek and would not significantly change among the people in the Commissions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;It would not spoil its success,&quot; said Rajchl has assessed his rivals. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The finest swimming pools of Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> A leap in the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Pataugeoires in perspective ovni, wonderful swimming pools in Budapest: travelling across Europe can live his blue miracle - and turned the city or a long walk, can leave its tired legs in carbonated water baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows how pool swimming can be the most experience of well-being. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder would travel research during the past 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: a bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back in the water, she retorted cupolas artistically arranged and swam against Putten marbles that was waiting on the other side of the pool and was to admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If a covered swimming pool it was fun, she noted in his book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architecture historian Meder and presented them in his book published: &quot;Badefreuden (Bain Joies.&quot; The municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;concrete buildings Hardcore&quot; in the Taunus. </seg>

<seg id="657"> The German 46 years is a fervent true culture bath. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Meder, explains that it is not a lot of interest in sport but restrictive feels attracted to water in a completely different way. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It is irritating that fans swimming should simply look blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the spellbinding fragrance of spruce forests or can listen to the birds trill Merry Park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I asked myself one day why pools must always be so ugly,&quot; said the Viennese. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started so a collection of beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="664"> And if the builders would have given a little more punishment rooms to swim could be a real treat for the eyes: &quot;instead of a floor was a surface water in the halls of swimming.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="668"> The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Alongside the baths splendid welfare as the Széchenyi bath aged 100 years in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the bath karst cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building-shaped bottle. </seg>
<seg id="670"> By contrast, pools heated outdoor Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views, while a roof bath in Zurich was the entire city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an external pool of St. Anton: the Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe animation on the ski trail. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects swimmers in Längenfeld: Ötztal Aqua Dome resembles unidentified flying objects that has just landed on the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> In winter, steam rises three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> The smell of bleach does not come from all pools of Meder collection. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths from a smell of sulphur, Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, to find themselves in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen, which is almost black and silt you glue skin as soon as you let slide into the pool - a spa experience. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During his pursuit of beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she was found in a field barrricaded. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath designed by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> A glance through the window of the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she observed the flourishing weeds between tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> She has observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace of spas of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only elements of neo-Roman leaving since its conception in 1844, but still a Moorish room Alhambra style which was added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernization of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath expert pool, Iris Meder - and not just because she is a native of Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It is already a beautiful performance of melting styles so different construction unit so great,&quot; said Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agricultural speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> The German bank examines in detail the speculation on the raw materials </seg>
<seg id="687"> Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> The German bank abandons its speculation on the raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to explore the consequences of speculation for the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that the banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two-thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this Avenue business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann emphasizes in this article that speculation Awards on global commodities, pushing prices upwards and that banks share complicity in global hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But the majority of experts share meanwhile opinion that bettors have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann responded to criticism differently from American competitors: he promised to investigate the accusations and said, &quot;no case is worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining accusations of Foodwatch-Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation of habit. </seg>
<seg id="703"> In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann built its image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: &quot;speculation on rising food prices shows a particularly drastic, how banks today are detrimental to the public interest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly today under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It matters little to Mr Ackermann, if it is a question of hungry people, or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to introduce a perfect image, a few months before he left office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Deutsche Bank did announce on Monday that the chairman of the Board of Directors will not change what is planned within the Board of Governors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> It could improve its image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And about potential losses, it has little to worry about - his successor will care. </seg>
<seg id="714"> One in two would terminate investments on raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> To date more than 30000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode published the survey Tuesday, with the November 7 and 8, the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many customers of the bank would also personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate following the poll, all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 percent déconseilleraient such a bank to their entourage, 49% said they would seek to terminate their account to change &quot; banking institution. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21 home in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion has moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> To Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with high, low and Happy End: the Austrian flag for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958, has won awards, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty, then fell into ruins. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is open and takes the place of home exposure. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its glass sheds, its strong and bold proportions and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958, is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pavilion Schwanzer once received the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; architecture for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is seen until today as an important step in the contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He has made so famous architects, he has also built the Pavilion for the Austrian universal exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary house, four-cylinder BMW and its adjacent construction-shaped bowl in Munich, he finally became famous internationally in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in Switzerland Garden at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century opened - </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However, it was also long used until contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and increasingly dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as the &quot;home of the 21 century&quot; and in the future will be used as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, the house, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new departure was carried out by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which has become the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, promoted a historian of art to another between considerable career in his youth of skater, with Sotheby&apos;s, at the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she led particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, it has received public funds and private sponsorship and exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba which bears the same name were exposed, a coffee and a bookshop, and an office must be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict surveillance, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the Krischanitz achievement was the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had changed and expanded sensitively secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the flag was &quot;an extremely important place&quot; where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> During the current changes, there were big problems: the building was &quot;an abyss of energy,&quot; said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of window glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced glass fibre was raised and the roof replaced by a safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The joists of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of light sifted between home and road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the front - it is almost a new construction, but always the slight Pavilion Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The exterior doors origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red-brown colour. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is identical to what it once was. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this under close supervision of authorities for monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often materials that are good and cheap to be found, and which also delight in the office of protecting monuments,&quot; said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a gross floor basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, building remained flexible and lightweight. </seg>
<seg id="753"> This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot; which came from Brussels, &quot; said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of &apos; Drop-in-the-City. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and despite everything &quot;awaken the good conscience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21 century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the &quot;neighborhood of Central Station&quot; any newly planned, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck perhaps will happen: the House of the 21 century could benefit from the addition of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the centre of Berlin temporary art, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Bahn plans a crisis package winter millions. </seg>
<seg id="758"> The railway corporation has developed a plan crisis, which aims to prevent accidents in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The number of employees is expected to double. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the battle against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the company railway Deutsche Bahn &quot; will spend more than 70 million this year. </seg>
<seg id="762"> &quot; The daily Bild-Zeitung reported beforehand, citing an internal crisis in the group that investments by a total of approximately EUR 300 million would be provided until 2015. </seg>
<seg id="763"> This should enable better availability of vehicles and the rail network, also in the case of extreme weather. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks should, among other double and switch to 16000 people. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The goal is to rid the wharves of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of track equipment needed to service in a period of four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago the head of station Rüdiger Grube has warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter the railway corporation has had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks among other reserves in case of difficult weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> That is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years an authorization from the Ministry of Railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The railway company has for years of what to do, given that it has to verify the axles ICE trains far more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central station in Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German bank Deutsche Bank &quot; pays millions of penalties in the US. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank Deutsche Bank &quot;must pay a fine&quot; to the tune of millions. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the industry is catching up in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pays compared to $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle a dispute because of the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It is the sale of mortgage documents. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to big banks a series of accusations, and for encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led banks downwards. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties begin proceedings in court,&quot; said a partner of Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank has recognised in comparison no fault. </seg>
<seg id="779"> It is also valid for Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the US and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator has also taken other large banks and in the summer he was assigned to Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Regarding the issue of mortgage documents &quot;mortgage-backed securities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="786"> The credit houses are at the base. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, This was fatal for a large number of banking companies. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the investment bank US Lehman Brothers collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Even though the events are already a few years ago, at the moment it is blowing on American banks a wind storm. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and the supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain compensation or to punish misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the biggest wave of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="792"> It accuses 18 large international banks, two financial house of American state Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&apos;s benefit in kind when business mortgage of about $200 billion. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, it is several operations for a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="794"> The supervisory authorities are asking that the Frankfurter responds &quot;substantial losses&quot; but without mentioning a specific sum. </seg>

<seg id="796"> WARREN Buffett increases among 10 billion IBM </seg>
<seg id="797"> Buffett, the guru of finance, is investing huge sums in the IT company IBM. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Since March, he bought shares with a value of more than $10 billion. </seg>
<seg id="799"> So far the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not investing in IT computer companies, given that long-term evolution of societies do reveal that poor prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="800"> However, he has read the reports from IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment from Warren Buffett is regarded as an attack of knight in the world of finance. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Therefore the IT activity IBM gives itself the right to be called &quot;Mr IBM.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="804"> Because Buffett revealed today at CNBC economic issue, it has bought since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="805"> Its holding investment company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far. </seg>
<seg id="807"> He congratulated the direction, even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;You have done a super job,&quot; said Buffett strategically. </seg>
<seg id="809"> IBM set for some time on the lucrative IT services as &quot; accounting centres. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years, offers both Software and consultation that calculators very efficient. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett had hitherto rather avoided technology companies. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He said he only invests in companies that he understands the business. </seg>
<seg id="813"> But Buffett tackles rather frêt rail, manufacturers of lubricants or machines. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as shares to a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re. </seg>
<seg id="815"> This in his eighties 81 years had resumed in the 1960s &quot; small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and was promoted to the rank of one of the most prestigious global enterprises through smart investments. </seg>
<seg id="816"> However, his lifestyle is modest. </seg>
<seg id="817"> That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname &quot;oracle of Omaha.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of the Buffett investment of the IBM shares have risen by one percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue&quot; as also appoints IBM, has a stock market value of a total of more than $220 billion and with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> For Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to participate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is palpable </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;cell&quot; Zwickauer the Turkish media have doubts about the state of German law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> One newspaper even talk of a &quot;bloody ideology,&quot; which will be new. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="827"> As a result of this new, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many German-Turkish spectrum thought death has long been: since the incendiary attacks Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was more violence comparable to right-wing extremist against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> In Germany, xenophobia, it has never been a question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The network of right-wing extremist who was detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot; Is this a return to the bloody ideology ,&quot; &quot; was the title of the Internet release of the Turkish daily &quot; Haberturk. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper Sabah &quot; stresses that one of the authors would have been a man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the quagmire of the extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is a reasoned that reacted to the Turkish community in Germany: it called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the agreement of German-Turkish recruitment. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with fresh colours that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Some Turkish media are a slap in the face: &quot;the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish- Haber &quot;X,&quot; which refers to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The German publication of the Hürriyet &quot; has no compunction to draw clear conditions. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It starts to puer&quot; Tel is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He pointed out that people have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The police action was perceived in a very critical about the German-Turkish forums and subsequently discussed the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to do research in some circles suspect extreme right are surprised the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than a willingness to at least rhetorical means even drastic: &quot;if the case continues to be botched, there will be migrants nothing other than self-defense and armament.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;It will be the best self-defense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,&quot; wrote &quot;Selen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="845"> What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks, however, have fuelled the sense of us in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> Once it is mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Kinkel - at the time, in his speech, how many taxes produced the local population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current report Turkish media shows once again how the distrust of many Germano-Turkish is deep against the rule of law locally since that date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and revaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message this time necessary. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS went bankrupt almost in the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is a German who must now lead. </seg>
<seg id="859"> It is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July that it would be in 2013.00 a.m.st as spectacular: President of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber has publicly welcomed welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and made kind comments on the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;UBS has passed the Turnaround.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> And yet, in September it was clear that everything was going to change. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A merchant securities UBS in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had soared about 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker, not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the board of directors of UBS is regarded as since suffering - and asking: when Axel Weber is it finally? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber may be advised the bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the presidency administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank had disclosed Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber that becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, much more professor of economics and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed a period of adjustment. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly it then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has yet to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of &quot;the biggest bank scandal in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it is faltering for years of a scandal. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, the savings so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and sound, but also crafty, she had combined with ambitious goals: it also wanted to be in the area of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Therefore, UBS managed a side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the world&apos;s largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This has made an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of bank for many years in Zurich says: &quot;I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;In the current context, one wonders: how is it that I could simply be wrong at this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It is profoundly wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it became clear that for the first time something was amiss at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which had hitherto been perceived as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later it was considered for what reasons he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had soared with sub-prime documents and write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this she has actually found investors, but shortly before, would froncé eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state from Singapore and a background of Arab state, which was passed over in silence, to the point that it has never learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This is, however, that the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank was to announce new losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was, given its investment errors in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank has bought UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country to host such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS&apos;s 2007 &quot; rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We have not been able to save UBS again,&quot; said the researcher from banks, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster followed the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months before, UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and expressed its willingness to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the taxman, perhaps with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine plus. </seg>
<seg id="901"> And UBS has more or less published that she had helped to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the wealthy clients: the prestige of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of money from clients. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And the bank had lost its credibility a few months in the two main areas: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid for tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm and, as had been thought that UBS would manage, he followed this unfortunate history of merchants: a single title merchant wildly EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realization that something was amiss. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it publishes: with risk management in the investment bank that does not always seems to work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the Adoboli case, it was found that the risk control too little changed,&quot; said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German bank is safe: &quot;the problem of UBS is that it has no risk control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> However, it was exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function, to become the guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - and the world could collapse beyond the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt &amp; Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in the central station of Zurich, which leads directly from the central station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are prestigious, rents stores are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers as Tiffany&apos;s, is here between the Swiss traditions stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries the Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace&apos;s Credit Suisse to elitist private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It arrives in the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are lined with marble, to lie thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for &quot;safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the customer research here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank has one day off the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the leader of a small private Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS would become far too much, there - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons were also widespread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And even when they have long since been adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This was the investment bank Anglo-Saxon changed UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;the crash of UBS.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the large bank of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could it happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If we are talking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and was constantly increasing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What helped is that the two different prédécesseuses banks UBS have completed: a rich bank, but lethargy with strong asset management in Zurich and poorer, but certainly already highly internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the international investment banks have been positively access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team,&quot; said the researcher banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very good in models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive, which has found its way to the summit with the learning of the bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would relied until the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli would probably have committed at the end of a decisive error: &quot;he thought that his models were the reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;It is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The staff of the UBS remembers clearly leaders meetings during which the leader of the group Wuffli gave the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It has commissioned the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which have documented the success at the time of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all, UBS wanted to climb while high. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already been successful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of currencies and transactions in securities it has played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisers, who have had responsibility, highlighted a weakness, however: in the international operations of interest in banking jargon &quot;Fixed income,&quot; there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS would have gaps in US mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, UBS has launched into an adventure, which almost cost the lives. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, it is also the bank itself that a fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It has turned into a massive machine that is packaged and documents of value based on US mortgages - but has also retained risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks sought long down. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, UBS bought here,&quot; said Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The euphoria is greater fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after another had to leave, when an end to attempts proved more difficult than was thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions in UBS became ejection and until now bancaux. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Whoever leads the large bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all business models suggested have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The researcher bank, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank concentration, property management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not (yet) go so far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank is atrophying vigorously, as far as it is clear so far. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, the bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Italo-Swiss aged 51 was only supposed to be transitional when the bank has broken with his predecessor Grübel surprise. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, it has emerged: it must sustain business of UBS, the Bank has provided Tuesday in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What does it make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber has already been raised. </seg>
<seg id="976"> He said publicly until now only that he would seek with his wife, an apartment in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>

<seg id="994"> Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: &quot;is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,&quot; he said in an interview on CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, it was his view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks. </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Crows smart spread in cities </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places, freux are considered &quot;problem of birds&quot; but experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer hunt cities for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some love, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residents &apos; complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> An antidote to the &quot;problem&quot; is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> In the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to drive the freux cities. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Experts from throughout Germany deliberated on possible solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They are looking for alternatives in cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> The protectors of nature makes the problems of cities on the exodus of freux particularly protected: the use of chemicals in agriculture destroy increasingly vital traditional spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Hunting, development and logging brood typical made life difficult for birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows are under the protection of nature. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large settlements with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics have found the capture birds in traps and killing with batons particularly brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;Normal expulsion, ousted, serves no purpose,&quot; the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The destruction of nests with water under pressure or cut down trees, often produced unintended consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;Animals deviate, large colonies are divided and they disperse in other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> &quot; The ousting is conceivable only in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We are forced to live with them, we can no longer kill them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif packaging and glittering offers to help resettle elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jûrgens prospectait &quot; info panels in place of chainsaws to completely different relations: &quot; we can finally better withstand a button in the face with a dose of confidence. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jûrgens has co-founded the Ascheberger-path-education baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the lives of these highly intelligent freux. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This project has been adopted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: &quot;this is a large number of communication, these birds have much to say.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: the freux use not only instruments work to arrive at a feast, but they make their tools themselves as instruments of work. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The éthologistes Cambridge University tested four freux recently, how is the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to do down scaffolding with stones in order to achieve a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without a lot of training, they déterminément recognized that a stone should have some size and shape to collapse the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second trial, crows astute then had to solve a problem more stout. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a cylinder placed vertically, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The birds could not reach their booty with their beak. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals formed a hook with which they fished the little bucket of small pipe. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four freux are even from the start. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: an Intimate History of the First World War&quot; (The beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters you greenhouse heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> A board to begin: carefully tear this page and make your mark-page. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will learn about these people in detail in this romantic tale of Peter Englund, the list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He wrote a book out of the ordinary that it describes, accurately, as &quot;a book of anti-history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains a few familiar names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so much a book about what happened, &quot; he says, &quot; a book outlining how this might look like. &quot; The &quot; sentiments, impressions, experiences and moods. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; summarizes the experiences in war 20 men and women more or less ordinary on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists in there, doctors, ambulance and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war; some will lose members, will become crazy or will lose their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives here reeling as candles church: while some lapse, new revival. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It provides a corrective to the idea that the First World War is more than the terrible war trenches on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; ably described other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and eastern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book are under hives; a Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving from the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina that reeks of the cordite still hanging. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When gun ringing in the distance, and you are a mother at home, stay or walk away from you? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> That will come anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, the lack of facts has been augmented by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor on the high seas fleet German. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most tackle deprivation and the ability to cope. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;ersatz, ersatz everywhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Coffee replacement, forged aluminum, imitation of rubber, paper, wood buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He goes on food replacement in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes the meat of rice cooked in fat sheep (and finished with a fake wood bones); tobacco manufactured with dry roots and skin dried potato; shoe soles wood. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> He says that &quot;837 meat substitutes allowed are registered in the production of sausages, also 511 alternative cafes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories address the honour and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own drive to the savagery and says about the war: &quot; you feel that, after all, that is what men, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there was no barbaric behind your formal shirt and cloutée. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it is likely to die, and that nobody will notice or pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When one is resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Unfortunately, it is rather similar to &quot;a condemned man strangled in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other comments relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition,&quot; writes Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the plants.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species within the bestiaire the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically confident, well-cut clothes, which executes its butchery while seated behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People act in unexpected ways; there are so many basic behaviors that heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund spoke of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and splashed on the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The most desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a lifetime blindness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to its task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has &quot;triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are beginning to wonder why their leaders do their war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books on the First World War are often indirect, such as &apos; Great War and Modern Memory &quot; (The Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or &quot; west nothing new, &quot; Erich Maria Note, rather than complete. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The book by Peter Englund is somewhat conventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most damning that I read in a non-fictionnelle. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do not reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had emerged from his book, your hands this page containing the list of people and burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets. </seg>

<seg id="1314"> The Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence underlining the risks and challenges for the Police Department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators who went against the regulation of the department and have created a storm of public solidarity with the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The police &quot; were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Capital exercise was held on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Police officers receive better training against the riots - anti-terrorist measures quickly move large numbers of police officers - to focus on the district of Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session took place on Monday evening, the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> Orders for travel in the park have reached &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said one accustomed, referring to the operation as &quot;a simple exercise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few policemen that I know and were called did not know they would be at Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person under anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones to know that they would be at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The city has managed to retain a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, police wanted to clean the park but have push by hundreds of demonstrators informed plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation Tuesday involved officers from various units of Police, whose operational forces across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particular neighborhoods criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said that many people coming and going in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. One o &apos;clock in the morning was a propitious time. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to proceed when the park had fewer people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The emergency services with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and resounding recorded messages loudspeakers appeared to intimidate the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While officers in community affairs entered the park with their windbreakers clear blue, many demonstrators simply gathered their belongings and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No attempt has been hit before 1.45 p.m. said Police, which has left time for occupants to collect their affairs. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police officers were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the Police Department, said that the action had been taken solely by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists, police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, sorely retained by officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the Police was moving westward across the thick jumble of cases of demonstrators, including luggage, lawn plastic and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams of the department of sanitation, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged the images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp have clung together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Emergency services were called to cut the padlock. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests have occurred in the park before 3: 30.00 p.m., Mr. Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to the Police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, almost 142 people have been arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most for &quot;disturbing public order and rebellion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest ranking official to be found on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although now, &quot;not led the operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of policemen patientaient along the eastern side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the case of intervention is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It was the Police widen the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, most equipped with shields, had been seen pushing people to lure. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Nearly 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the warmest night took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5.00 p.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the overturned car Police; others were observed to puncture the tires of a police truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen by stealing from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to initiate a trial Wednesday in the city for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies. The impact is disproportionate schools serving disadvantaged schoolchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the Council&apos;s 37th District, to try to reverse the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two school aid coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the lowest paid in the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October; the union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not having left the city access to a fund for health care, led by groups of workers, and that would have enabled us to close the gap in the budget last spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities have strongly denied the accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A Council member retaliated, stating that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officers of the Council&apos;s 37th District said they fulfilled a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the prosecution at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defendant. Grievors will be represented by eight workers laid off, all black or Latino origin, like most school aid that have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft obtained by the New York Times, the union capitalizes on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest neighbourhoods of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular under-funding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and some in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23 District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th District neighborhoods south of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employees at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claim that &quot;this is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of 36 public school has been reduced from 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each registration of disadvantaged students. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also claims that the directors of high schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo employed the term &quot;overshoot&quot; to describe the action, even though &quot;overshoot&quot; describes the action usually move a school teacher to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the draft complaints, &quot;sixty-six parent coordinators have been laid off,&quot; and &quot;not just for overtaking.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission: Congress is an agreement on the issue of Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems finally that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took a successful uprising, capture and death of the dictator long Muammar Qaddafi as well as the American involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts, with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their &quot;courage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the courage of Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, several resolutions to approve the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain have submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been subject to a vote in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The US mission is therefore remained under a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug out from under the feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October last year. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission was officially completed on October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee &quot;congratulate the Libyan people for his extraordinary courage and determination to freedom&quot; and &quot;congratulate the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and great professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also says &quot;the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measure will win it the support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or divide it legislators like last June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The senator and chairman of the Commission D. Richard Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said on Monday that D. Richard Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have not so far managed to get their amendments, but it is not without trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The amendment Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions in the House only the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful &quot;to control federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but their support - including the new Republicans who wish to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being the &quot;author&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote in the House and Senate on the amendment for a balanced budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat - New York wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, like the amendment banning desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Also greedy were members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> When the 111th Congress, lawmakers have proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 during the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slows from the early 1990s, when members tended to offer more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;The sword but not beaten,&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shot at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) Monday night appeared in a television broadcast, sang &quot;the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; Broadway and stated that it would primarily recover rather than return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> During his appearance on &quot;20/20&quot; on ABC, the chain alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> &quot; Issuing approached its difficult return following the ball, which has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied &quot;quite well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of &quot;20/20&quot; on the eve of the exit of the new couple&apos;s book entitled &quot;Gabby: a story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> &quot; Special broadcast has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, we see on his hospital bed, his shaved head and a large scar on his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn him to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A sign of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A movement of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, her first word: &quot;what.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords has whispered another word (&quot;toast&quot;) to ask to change the menu of his breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative currently sing with air doctors Cyndi Lauper Girls Wanna Have Fun &quot; and Tom Petty &quot; free Fallin &apos;? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said he did not recall the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, he was reading an article about the shooting of March 12, when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treaty pending the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;There has been a lot of deaths,&quot; said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During his recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, &quot;I was beaten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I would say, &apos; Gabby, you have not been beaten,&quot; said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you are going out, restore and come back even stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More pity that respect for the troops </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala on Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ride on the helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in costume-tie is standing on its feet for a standing ovation. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The military men and women are seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the fund-raising in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A high-ranking military officer present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of Staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They have been presented as a kind of orphan,&quot; wrote the top-ranking military officer in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it is not in compliance. Just pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Praise lavished on the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say some military. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all of the victims,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of hapless minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not wish to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the anger of revenantes troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most of the conversations on the pity in confidence among the veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some people would watch with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and travelled to distant lands. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others will ask if &quot;a veteran angry and violent lurks beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were to move the talks asked subtly if he would be able to cope under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from battle. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you raise the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,&quot; recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The victories are rarely praised by a country also unfamiliar with the army, which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as the Second World War,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno pensioner, who led the troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of politicians and people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized for the number of times endured services, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army in the face of growing pressure to crack down on rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier 1 Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant night 11 weeks where she says she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and she returned to his barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having had dinner with a friend, when she met a fellow carrying a pack of beers. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked him if he could join her in her room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot; C &quot; was an alarm signal, &quot; says Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texane has set aside its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, it was 19 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is Texas,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I had to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after entering the chamber Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, thrown by land and raped, she claimed. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, wait anxiously the court ruling in a landmark trial, which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape within the army, and undermining the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved initially 17 plaintiffs, which amounted to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers; they also claim that the army was not investigated, prosecuted or provided appropriate justice after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke says the military galonnées, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> The lawyer also said that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future legal proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of bringing all plaintiffs in this case - putting all its eggs in one basket - it will start several trials, if necessary, to keep up the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel on active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of complainants&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Department has refused to make any comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have still not officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is recorded on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only men. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women soldiers teams play an increasingly important role, especially to come into contact with local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernise says Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in that fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> Has the law school at Yale, the centre of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorders&quot; attributed to rape victims in order to give their leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Bhagwaru Anu Service Women&apos;s Action Network (women), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle applications for benefits to the people who say they have been victims of sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, $3.158 sexual assaults were recorded after the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, according to its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure represents approximately 13.5% 19.000 incidents this year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report published in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the army have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police rape less than an hour after the fact. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she said, he was asked to tell his detailed 11 times rape at various police, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She has suffered a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut on his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, a trial in which we asked about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people have testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was delivered,&quot; says Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to start having contractions. I yelling at the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot; I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I am leaving, I remember saying to my commander &quot; was not his trial but mine. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has come to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Is this the case Lyman and other complainants argue or not, it is a long story, &quot; says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he noted, &quot;in my opinion, they should be able to move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticised the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrent posed by responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they are trying,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things change only when the good have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs &apos; lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight against the army on this issue so that there will be no reform,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where until we would, one or other of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy doing his anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy... Connectez to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that it is not so difficult that trace,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recent report by the group of DEMOS reflection on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the people they seek with scientific precision - how marketers are doing for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> &quot; Jamie Bartlett&apos;s team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme-right groups in Europe; it has targeted with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product advertisements invited users to respond to an inquiry. Questions related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> When they come into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to interview 10000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a new way of doing research,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some results are not surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young and immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, those who combine activism online and offline-are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> &quot; L DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> The focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the &quot;I love,&quot; publications on the walls and updated statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, &quot;supernova data&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research the site&apos;s name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you could not approach in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you are attempting to carry out investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You go to the party, but you would never have allowed to enter,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoids any - you direct access to their information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address the health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook exploits of intoxicated had enormously more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet about this. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would too often alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can&apos;t treat a problem if you do not diagnose,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, behavior and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and in another case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly accesses information of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot; The site team that handles data has studied the statistics concerning the situation in love and on the day of the Saint Valentine, the turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and an index of national happiness (thanks to the only information available - the champions of the digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the site was watching, they like or not - in exchange for power playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is authorized to access your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when users of Facebook are part of an investigation that they have not even heard of? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of its students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they know, exchanges were seen by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;The social studies are expected to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not in front of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks, which have been 77 deaths in Norway this summer, is described as a &quot;fighter&quot; resistance in his first appearance at the trial, which takes place in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Templiers of Norway,&quot; he says before a courtroom packed with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I repudiate it, because you keep your mandate organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts, but I am not pleading guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he &quot;did not want to give him an opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who has brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The judge Nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, he was forbidden to speak to the media for four weeks and has warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Some 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that it would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I found cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya to the television channel NRK Norwegian. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;I was not comfortable, but I am personally a bit advanced after having seen and heard the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial; he has watched journalists and survivors in the eyes while entering and leaving the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the bizarre idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of &quot;resistance,&quot; the judge has determined that it was not crazy, and he also said that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The attacks of July 22, therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which can be réconfortera. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would have preferred that it resembles a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons lost interview with Steve Jobs, the cinema this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical engineering and inventor of the modern computer. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what fans of Apple may find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs regained recently and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer, identified a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeder charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a &quot;disease their suggesting that a brilliant idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &apos; Triumph of the Nerds. &quot; This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and unusual conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> This time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple; he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after the death of Steve Jobs a complete video is found in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly rebound, is the basis for the film 68 minutes entitled Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known to detest the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic expose philosophies technological and commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts in order to give a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> It also discovers moments when perfectionism of Steve Jobs reappearing, where it seems eager to hear the questions Cringely, kicking elbow to accelerate and move on to issues or topics of greatest importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and its own vision on the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring the man we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He then explained the dishes away. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequence of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the way he has learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot; During all these years, I have always asked: &apos; Why are you doing things? &quot; And the answers are always the same: &apos; Oh, simply because we need to make them. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why nobody is thinking in depth in a company. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs continues giving details on its efforts to simplify accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Puzzled as to how the costs were registered - often begins with a &quot;standard cost&quot; evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; - he has developed an automated plant that would guarantee a precise calculation of costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> The opportunity to play a round on the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;blue box&quot; that he has created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and call free long-distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device has been the subject of numerous written beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, a call and then hooking an AT &amp; T network to another while bypassing all satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We enveloppions the ball different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez public phone and it arrived a minute later the public telephone next door,&quot; says Jobs laughs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and thanks to this box, we learned that we could we create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We did not know much, but we have been able to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things; it was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would one day have existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the blue in the middle of the night by impersonating Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are crazy laugh just before the Pope himself is awakened. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On his love with technology (and canvassing Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, the hunt for spare parts to manufacture a fréquencemètre, he seeks Bill Hewlett the number in the directory and passes a phone call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets holiday part-time at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot; This has had a remarkable influence on me, &quot; was the only company that I have seen at this age and this formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs has subsequently become a HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the first desktop ever designed. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as large as a suitcase, had a small tube. I fell in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The teenager that I was returned with HP and began to write programs for this machine. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvisation innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working at only 30 days credit, he had to address the assembly and delivery devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember big disputes... I cried over by claiming that it would take five years to produce a mouse that would cost $300] I have had enough, I left and went to see a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15 and was incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> The big companies that burn out: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Well before it is reliving Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Admit that you work for IBM or Xerox, you better copier or better printer, and after?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have a monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can evolve, so [it is these types of people] who eventually lead businesses and specialized staff product are set to decisions taken. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product from a bad product - the manual work required. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have snatched defeat to victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Innovation as artistic form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot about its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are trade-offs... Some things you can&apos;t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling it to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, decisions are made by personal taste; it is trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and try to bring these things to the product you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy and that great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have always ashamed to steal good ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> That is partly what makes exceptional Macintosh. People who worked above were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have simply proved the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law while the court meets </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama&apos;s health will be heard, two justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases involved a lawsuit by 26 states challenging the health care reform ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for activists conservatives nationally. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to hear the complaint, a monumental argument about 5: 30.00 p.m. is expected in March next year, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the presidential race in 2012, which will be booming when the court&apos;s decision will be made. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will be held before the court and will on the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The legal firm Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the League Fédéraliste (Federalist Society), a group long dedicated to defend the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the national Federation of independent businesses (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the tribunal on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Was there, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican Senate and declared opponent of the bill of health. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Guests at the dinner star? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Fédéraliste Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the code of Canon 4C, which states: &quot;a judge may attend fundraising organizations related to the right and although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the programme of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This breach of ethics and superb indifference to code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges drank and were enjoying having dinner and a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds from this event to dismantle any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they too easily mix the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni is a high-profile conservative. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the initial objections to the law were raised to the level of the Court of First Instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pushed for Kagan recuse himself to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan gave no indication that it would. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing has a record order for $18 billion for airliners </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners bi-corridors, with the option to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There is nothing extraordinary in what a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> It is a case where the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 planes reached a record $18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally incredible is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine of growing future aircraft orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2520 planes worth a total of $450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Over the weekend, Boeing has informed the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who has spent this gargantuan order. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced in the Salon Dubai Aerospace of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners dubbed, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six aircraft&apos;s &quot; more than a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;These clients in particular have an immense value.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have a lot of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, they not only have the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so damaging as the country would gain money with the rise of oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> It is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil increases, reported Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural risk coverage,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The Emirates order strengthens the dominance of Boeing in the market for heavy-lift aircraft and help curb the attempted encroachment of the Airbus competitor with its A350 plane. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of the lounge Boeing aerospace comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ERs are received. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus pushes its inception to increase the outbreak at the request of its customers to increase its capacity and its autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The actions of the Boeing company rose by 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in elections Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access to the functions of Michoacán governor during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this state in the west. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán, but for the entire country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon radio in an interview on Monday after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot; They threatened our candidates, election officials... They have seized ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have forced people to vote for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until losing the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo does not seem to be outspoken little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, candidate of the Left Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential for this divided and unhappy left. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognize the results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any connection with the drug traffickers and has urged other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However, violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally in the campaign by fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, the PRI, corrupt elections Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man expected to represent the PRI in the race for president, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The BASD urges Asia to help the euro zone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the euro zone to emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a decline in the long term that would prevent the development of Asian economy. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, director general of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing regions in the world should &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe &quot;indifferent eye&quot; and noted that an Asian financial support alongside leaders and resources of Europe would &quot;avoid a collapse in the long term&quot; global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the Economic Forum World in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that nothing prevents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> In recent months, the euro zone has been severely shaken by a sovereign debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has spurred fears that the global economy falls into recession, and has raised the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag raised hopes that the IMF would provide any aid Asian, but he also said that the bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds of financial rescue fund of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater power in negotiations Asian partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that &quot;India will do everything it can&quot; to help the euro zone since its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of arrivals of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the eurozone remains unstable and agitated,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have enormous challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich when they face their own significant economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe Indian 1.2 billion, of which at least 800000 live on $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at age 50 and they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow,&quot; he noted. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials paid poorly managed that generate losses, as in the rail sector. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause &quot;significant impact&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Forecasts BASD economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &quot;risk of loss&quot; because of the threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He pointed out that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect itself from an economic downturn and large capital flight. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Severe warnings from the Pentagon on the potential reductions in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security; it has triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, gatherings of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already digest $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now feared that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; said Panetta, in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, would lead to 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a significant reduction and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and our construction projects unfeasible - you can&apos;t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other efforts to modernize,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes by the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts affect possibly fighting troops, continues Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the financing in wartime accounts contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the core budgets,&quot; warned Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The contractor personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contract that support the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The manager staff salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to providers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping on the Defense Department would trigger a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed global leader of military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action,&quot; said the senators in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;It is not a consequence with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The letter from Panetta and recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself came to the highest position in the Pentagon with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the defense secretary has painted a bleak picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but no core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a squad without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is a fighter, without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission,&quot; said Panetta during his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a strength depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, it invites aggression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how further reductions could &quot;generate significant operational risks: deadline for responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could spend at sunset, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the ballistic submarine new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stop the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step for improvement and response to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to identify a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A glance at recent headlines indicates how deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of Penn State have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports that a football coach retired sexually assaulted boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie has destroyed careers and convulsé countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The member of Congress from New York and celebrity Internet Anthony Weiner went for a fool by issuing quickly contradicted denials by irrefutable evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign financing related to coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, none of those who experienced history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in his second term ​ on its ​ sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories of cheating on tests of school and university are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers have given the answers to tests students to do their performance evaluations. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors should teach the contrary to send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception encounter? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of them are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect or detect lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to say &quot;I have had,&quot; the detection of deception is a serious industry knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search of such projects, notably in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about the lies were démystifiés. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars look at you in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They bégayent, feeling or not always dangle. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A lie called detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, micro-facial expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years examining scientific results in the wide body and still emerging knowledge on deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and helpful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars are adept at reading the others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the outgoing lie more than the introvert, men say more lies &quot;focused on them&quot; while women say more lies &quot;focused on the other&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are seen as a mécréant, others will feel less guilty of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> Firstly, observe the normal behavior of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> That is what is called &quot;establish benchmarks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring the subsequent changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Look at the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You need to know if someone is stirring normally his feet continuously in order not to launch unjust accusations when you see the stirring the feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices as red flags, no evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The misleading people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can target their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, changing posture significantly or submit a relief of &quot;post-interview&quot; - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the difficult questions are the past. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often falsely indicate that maintenance is completed just to try to trigger the reaction post-interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also, beware of the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson misfired using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search to find. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The misleading individuals can also use language outpaced: &quot;I have not had sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or entirely repeat a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;waffle&quot; in its response to a difficult question: &quot;well... to tell the truth... if I remember property... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by hustlers in their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan pipeline will be diverted after the threat of delayed approval of the United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking anger unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area of dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill from Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The official TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;It is a real way forward,&quot; said Terry Lee, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a decision by the State Department, and expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline of 2.735 km extends from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would carry 700000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do this, it would have to pass through six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have relied on the 20000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are pushing a bill to force the remoteness of the region&apos;s Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact of the State Department has found that the project would cause only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry has said that the Inspector General of the ministry has ordered an investigation separate from the review process, focused on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomit fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says that the disco diva Patti LaBelle embarked on a deadly rampage in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade &quot;singer Lady Marmalade&quot; spooked the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, to such an extent that she has suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;the heightened fear of foreigners,&quot; said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year while the scene technician Kevin Monk, his wife, a teacher of kindergarten, Roseanna and Geneviève were preparing to travel as a family. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk would search the car, Roseanna Monk snaked down in the lobby of their building&apos;s Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Geneviève in his arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that she had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot; Someone came behind me and said: &apos; Do you know what your daughter? &quot; I said &apos; yes &apos; and I went to look, &quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle chastised angrily pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot; She told me of an aggressive tone: &quot; you should not let your daughter near the door, &quot; said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot; I told him: &quot; what you say or think I am not interested. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became enraged and began to use expletives - the word &quot;and the word&quot; with a strong voice... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water and started to sprinkle water bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot; I said to the woman: &quot; look what you did to my daughter, &quot; said the mother of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was always Geneviève in his arms - and had to be chosen by his entourage has brought to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, &quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family has sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no reply. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks unspecified damage, but the family&apos;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to charity cancer for children. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct,&quot; Mr. Davis said. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially against a kindergarten teacher on an 18-month-old child.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Adversity climate has slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management Mario Lopez Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality grew, foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government Mario Lopez Valdez, self-called for the change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, the increase is not, in exchange, there was a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures of February, cause losses trillion for the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the state&apos;s economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of assignments by the frosts produced by the Mexican Council Development Rurale Sustainable, there has been damage to 582 million 835 hectares, including a 78.03 per cent have suffered the total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were the vegetables, corn and chickpeas. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline in economic activity generated until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because during the January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Économique Labour, in the second quarter, the rate is now 5.28 percent and the July to September the average continued to raise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 miles sinaloens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18000 969 people. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Sciences Economic and Social of UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;That is an increase in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars an unlawful manner is not easy work for the win, they invest them and use them in something,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Detained migration </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulty of entry and secondly because entering they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask sources of work, which means that unemployment rise,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Lack of seriousness </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the labour market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population involved in this state is working without pay as a worker in any social insurance institution. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason to lag in the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly income of workers sinaloens was until September 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> The decline in economic activity and rising unemployment in 2011 we recorded the greatest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economics from January to June the FDI state has reached 630 thousand 697 million, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 million 143 thousand 312 million recorded in the same period the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accrued a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos per year, mainly recorded by companies of the tertiary sector. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> Debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government has requested in July at the congress public approval of a $3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim to reactivate the economy, congressional approval of the State was 2.600 trillion pesos and until November there was no benefit of debt in any sector of the economy of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> The representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Industry Chamber of Transformation, said that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to recover the ground we have lost this year in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to bring the effort and especially good already synchronized march of this new Government team, let us hope that next year will be much better,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Slow economic </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López said that events such as the frozen at the beginning of the year have been the state&apos;s economy and have restricted its performance and growth. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The bottom fluxe economic product of several events, among which the jellies, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level e flows in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations that we had,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Redefining the vocation </seg>
<seg id="1891"> For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of Management Confederation of Mexican Sinaloa stated that it wants to harness the state towards productive activities more dynamism. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In general terms we have observed that we worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that detonates the full potential of material and human resources of Sinaloa,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Much to do </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that channels better efforts by the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various fields, in terms of economic development, there are some advances, but it is important to develop a programma long-term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the management of public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> &quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A person Novolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana. </seg>

<seg id="1906"> The director of municipal Social Development said that although so far the construction programmes have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the State Government is acquitted its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programs. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> He noted that in total investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their final stages. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> &quot;They must provide a contribution of $12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon conclude they have given us nothing, although since July they should give us a party,&quot; he says, &quot;and we, to register no delays, we began the books and we have come a long way, but we need the money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1909"> He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore, at the beginning of the administration Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;We had already suffered in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and programs continue to function and this year, to be able to have access to these programs, we duu get the resources to cover what the state had not paid,&quot; détailla. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management for the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> The Court validates &quot;analog cut&quot; in Mexico in 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The substitution of analogue reported by the finger is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice&apos;s (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called &quot;analog&quot; cut from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his authority when he issued the decree detailing the actions to follow to make the transition to the digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft sentence, developed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the decree as non-constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of television and radio is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of subordination and reserve law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favour of the project have voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and even Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, the Senate as the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversy to challenge the decree and complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions planned for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary meeting of ministers has resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his speech, the President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards that the public administration is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I believe that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has constitutional mandate for the leadership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitution of analogue reported by digital reported is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years and this translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postpone the change, argued it would postpone the benefits of the digitisation involves a decision of public interest which has not only a technical dimension, &quot;because it also includes economic, social and political issues of national security.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These issues, stressed, &quot;require the operation of an entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution gives the power of the executive of the state.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> He recalled that a large number of countries across the world have already finished the digital transition, and they have done through the executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> We cannot conclude that the executive, emitting the contested decree has invaded a form the competences of Congress, because it provides in the sphere of administrative compliance with laws issued by the Legislative, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> An analysis of the possibility of a &quot;vote by vote count&quot; Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the data highlighted by PER, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of &quot;vote by vote count&quot; is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Results Program Électoraux Preparations (PER) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. </seg>

<seg id="1933"> You will recall that Michoacán has not approved or its Constitution Policy nor his Electoral Code of State or Justice Act Electoral, at the same time as the state Congress approved the reforms shortly before that end the legal deadline for this electoral trial can enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication deadlines under the Law of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice&apos;s (SCJN) has solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the agent for the constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to &quot;punish or challenge.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1936"> Thus, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not the president; or there are obvious errors or alterations in minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> In addition, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election can be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election and has secured the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the session is a petition express the representative of the party and/or coalition presented the second candidates reported. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total amount of voting can also be achieved if at the end of the count, it follows that the difference between the supposed winner and second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a specific petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packets that have been subject of the partial count. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PER, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 minutes total. </seg>

<seg id="1979"> A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> It is expected that it presents a new cabinet in its majorities by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said he would present the results to the chairman of his conversations with the political parties in his essay to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European Commissioner for journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti has not explicitly said that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> &quot;The framework is now well-worn path,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days in a shorter time than normal, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt levels impossible to sustain. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Highlighting the pressure on Monti to dispatch, market instability in the performance of BTP Italian 10-year bond above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved. </seg>

<seg id="1989"> We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to ensure this emergency situation. </seg>

<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers &apos; groups and juveniles and women&apos;s organizations. </seg>

<seg id="2009"> While the national champions and Europe, the number of monthly rankings of FIFA, recorded a broad registry games inter-selected class A, the Tricolore has only defender Michael Umana as the only one to have 50 international matches. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernandez. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year activities in league championships and national cup and wrangling in European Cup as the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> All this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the playoffs complicated Cup and the World Cup. </seg>

<seg id="2036"> This is an excerpt of the conversation, the full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> It is the second time in the South and Central America and so far it has been magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I have spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> We therefore émotionne to bring our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What is your message for your most ardent followers? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for staying beside us for all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> There have been 21 years so that we can arrive at Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so much time had to spend up to this concert. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> What this adds a bit of pressure on your visit. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in good shape for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> We are very eager to produce. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we like to surf and the jungle; for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How have you discovered Costa Rica and waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends would always make surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, alongside Mexico, are great places to make surfing; that is what we learned through the gentes who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Seeing the tour, offered with huge shows, with great songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we no longer have interpreted for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we can have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> It is that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In retrospect, it is hard to believe everything that you have succeeded? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> In the first place, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it seems a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and be able to continue to make music together, we émotionne much. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could only get better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> That means for you to have been a key element in the creation of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a group is a city, but it is much more bizarre when five or ten groups emerge at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We are playing with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to still be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of its Seattle has arises. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a group like your continues united and with the same members for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally lasts. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the first place, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends, and that there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of everyone and it could get better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we have grown, it has been easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big numbers and people who love music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us to remember that we must respect the music and what has made without realise that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really any of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we have written good songs and at the beginning it was magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photograph I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It is a surprising and we are lacking. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, production has sent us videos with various proposals and that was the group that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer direct and it must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It is a matter for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It was he who sings and I think it is doing with the first words he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, what are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first that I remember there was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has managed Pearl Jam has maintained the grunge in spite of the fact that it is no longer fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I have mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that arise at the same time, and if it is now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth the trouble to listen and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What should this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I have listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that if you are growing and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and music and songs, probably represent it for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that it can also be happy and even as it can be done to obscure music. </seg>

<seg id="2136"> Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first video game Nintendo originally designed for this medium,&quot; because so far success as &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; was adaptations of existing titles. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide on the appropriateness of convening beyond polemics on fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contests on 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid-1980s, in the height of the already-extinguished Corporation Métropolitaine de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the large park in the metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> It also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that does not move on the north-south axis, otherwise high mountain (bottom) - (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The Collserola qualification as natural park is to the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with wild boar in the role of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed by 16 competition for all access doors Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door calls the idea of park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> It is this, or someone wants to put doors. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question appears alone: Collserola: Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both in terms of its organization as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation all architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme, including two members of this ancient caste elected speak when they recognize in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this is just one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after addressing the littoral front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot; because the speech Ildefons Cerda, blocks green has not been brought to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot; We have to start from the premise that the largest fleet of Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for his great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot; gave the verdict the architect for the title of &quot; Collserola doors &quot; contains a &quot; lexicon trap &quot;: it must consider &quot; such as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas in which we must act. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some perils.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The perils that are derived from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s and has been in the area of the Forum, &quot;his swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is own demarcation of borders on which we can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something means already set the next step,&quot; that is to say, its excess. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We need to think about new instruments urban planning, because the current [in reference to General Plan Métropolitain (PGM) ] can cause authentic disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> In addition to the question, Modol opinion that, by simplifying the slope of the El Valle region Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the conflicting interests of Collserola &quot; must not be lost, &quot; thanks for the opportunity that the mayor offers his corporation to intervene in this project from the very first time. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> It means that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that enables architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; whether this looming technique must lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success,&quot; he says) that it is creating: &quot;we, the architects, should be just an instrument.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition it lacks a comprehensive vision of Collserola: &quot;we called 16-cutting competition - he says - in mountains, but there is not a longitudinal reading track and understand the area as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This is, at least in this case, he has opted to participate in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In another way, a project for doors to shock in the programme and definition with the architect of the door. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda Dalt should provide throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and green. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released </seg>

<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a small area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a trajectory and right side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was hit against the soil in structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> It has not detected traces of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft from one type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the soil. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work was found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above mean sea level, the soil had a slope that runs for seven dégrées 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly désarticulé throughout his journey. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the soil. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a thorough search in an area more than the place surrounded around the accident has not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; this is borne by the IPN specialists </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called protocol &apos; genetics of obesity in children and adolescents who will have the markers associated with being overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the Investigation Unit Médicale in Biochemistry Hospital of specialities of the National Medical Center of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and attend social. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) Polytechnic National Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The investigation are invited to participate population with or without the right to stand for sports units of the IMSS participating in Valle de México, where is the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00.00 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Cuauhtémoc Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and from October 8, the activity is taking place in the Sports unit Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After reaching the goal of raising $500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and e know the components and the importance of genetics in regard to the development of obesity and identify among children and young Mexican risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As we celebrate on November 14, the World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires related to food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will also be requested on their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their illnesses, to avoid the risk factors that trigger ailments such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He detailed that Saturday will apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, girth size), blood pressure, determining levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (trying to identify people associated with childhood obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos; The health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; as regards the overweight has also seen a dramatic increase, &quot; stressed the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said that the justification for research markers is based on the fact that the country&apos;s population is different from the other by his genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He informed that, on average, the Mexicans have a 65 percent of heredity Indo-American, 30 percent and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to combust the excess energy that burns (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which can detect if they are overweight or obese. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Ila even said that the presence of dark colour folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of having metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors call the written to parents, which are explained each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they must make to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: the sedentarism, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use transport instead to walk short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another reason is the high caloric intake, it is the largest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales pâté - meat to maize flour wrapped in leaves of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fat and protein and genetics analysed in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the School of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt polymer modified to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the reported that the streets were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the metropolitan area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the School of Chemistry (FQ) UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of oil is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During its conference A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, which is responsible for developing asphalt polymer modified to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high as low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera has estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance and, therefore, the training of cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest share of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give the paved his characteristic viscoelastic behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is the fact that, at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C, it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resistance in the streets of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three imply asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the most superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones drenched asphalt and compacted later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each small stones that form the layer, signalât is drenched year asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When vehicles are generating efforts, it allows the forces spread very well in the streets. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If we had the modified asphalt, they propagate better, opinât ingénier the chemical. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> The layer of asphalt, he says, there is a final layer called layer of rotation, fieldstone fine, that is to say, the sand is also steeped in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must be more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide grip in the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of that receives and distributes the efforts of the rotation also requires that a proper thickness and the material it is made must be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they greatly affect the performance of the layer of asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the soil is wet, water spreads inside the layer is difficult it is that way, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the trial of formation, he said, the first striker is the film rolling and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with proper maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the National System of Chercheurs explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent training blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> That missed the candidate Valle for the new Colombia miss? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna not obtaining the crown of Colombia miss. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives its title number 14 princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> New Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winning, wear the crown and the band that accredits as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department already $14 titles Princess and Melina is a a legion of women of Valle del Cauca, who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many of the world is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> That is what he has missed because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first considered a key factor in the decision by the jury to designate the First Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with his answer to the question? &quot; What was the book that has marked and why? Asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the response of Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot; I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think it is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think the book was my childhood is &quot; the little prince, &quot; it is a pretty profound book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &quot; crime and punishment, &quot; it is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book is called &quot; hard &quot; blood. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> That response did not please firstly because of the term &quot;culturaliser&quot; and secondly for not specifically explain how each book was marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the outcome &quot; the universe and wise, what should happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for everyone, read a little bit, &quot; the little prince &quot; is a great book &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by patronage. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist in Bogota has insinuated that the preferred, enthusiastically applauded and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;it woke jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the queen and that is why it has not shone on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it noted in its first presentation in swimsuits at the beach at Hilton and its two parades of the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even if the two parades she had seemed sure of itself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme &quot;como&quot; (As at home), NCR Canal said that the fact that Melina had been designated princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the National Competition Beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman engaged in regard to the social needs of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before starting the competition are already involved in projects,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It also speculates that Valle has sinned by its flaws of his behind and fibrosis who was in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, precisely because the jury was elected as the natural candidate &apos; Beauty &apos; with the most healthy body, good nutrition and physical work responsibly. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, he was better, &quot;but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, left points on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos sees the error of Valle was the surgery that she had suffered. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot; Surgeries are good, but Valle failed to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body has never been his asset and she lost because of this. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For that price, that the National Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has a cruel prediction that was done last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was Melina not to give him a taste for the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year reign, not as sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by designating the National Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who despite his dazzling passage in Cartagena, did not receive the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste Cali rose to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The November 4 dactyloscopiste ITC Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc, &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; by confronting his fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Seven dactyloscopistes working in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of &quot; availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who has worked for 21 years in the judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes Chocó, where a lot of times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses that had to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000, he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after classes adequate, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, that is to say the palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had warned Eliazar take with him clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something very large. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he went to Cauca in Palmira helicopter. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he had to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla oldest in the world, therefore asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the team of investigation to the corpse, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more lean. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a galtonienne magnifying glass, ink, sampling and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye was not wrong: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme commander of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Research footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Sijín dactyloscopiste of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano,&quot; is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> A lot of people not familiar with our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from identifying the corpses, dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When captured, many offenders are false identity cards or have no documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take their fingerprints and seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher has narrated in a theft case he had to remove a section of wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a safe full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights,&quot; he recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently we found a man dead, with beverage bottles around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> By interlude investigation has determined that a parent may be suspicious of crime and a footprint on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if no guarantees that it is not the killer, the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste ITC explained that extract &quot;the fingerprints of objects with reactive chemical or physical.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, using a sampling or a band for the levy. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there is still a lot of undocumented Colombian,&quot; indicated the expert of the ITC. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the television programme CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Like all that glitters is not gold, that affects is not necessarily an imprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, it can be used, if it achieves the necessary confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators jostled before the Zuccotti for camping. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large proportion of people have joined the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The integrative movement Occupe Wall Street have defied the authorities on Tuesday in New York trying to enter through a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another fleet of Great Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators jostled before the Zuccotti, where they wanted to enter through a judicial order that allows &apos; outraged &apos; camping again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation by occupying a park north of the city, where there have been new judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stand again in the place, we will move to another location, and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;is Wall Street,&quot; Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray explained that the response of &apos; outraged &apos; to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came up to the courts, where Lucy Billings judge issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, the &apos; indignant &apos; have occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the Police has shifted and arrested some protesters, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, ensuring Efe the fact that he has seen some journalists who were also spent handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there is Centenaries people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support for members of the movement and tried to intervene on behalf of the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, the Zuccotti - which is a forum for private property - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday, during which we must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some protesters moved previously focused and distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and they were the same officers guarding the place, which has caused some small clashes, &quot; said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some official struck the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate Occupe Wall Street or enforce laws &apos; published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators access once again to the park with tents or other properties that they used previously. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, which it has, however, warned that local laws do not allow to settle with tents and bags to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn to Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and has been taken due to the fact that the demonstrators &apos; violated the law. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became &quot;a place where people came to protest, but for violating laws and in some cases, to hurt other people,&quot; because &quot;some stores had received threats&quot; and residents were afraid &quot;for their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and demonstrates that basically Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of &quot;not respecting freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Officials &quot;occupies Wall Street&quot; have also indicated that they do not think hold &quot;major action&quot; on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate two months of protestes, which started on September 17. </seg>

<seg id="2398"> Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, it will emerge in the television programme &apos; It&apos;s a Russell Peters &apos; Christmas next December 1 </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in &quot;home Improvement,&quot; paramedic in &quot;Baywatch,&quot; rabbit &quot;playboy,&quot; wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special programme of Noel on Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the &quot;crooner&quot; (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian will emerge in the television programme &apos; It&apos;s a Russell Peters &apos; Christmas next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV has now distributed pictures of the television programme in which Anderson, also known for the widely on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband this time, the batsman &quot;Mötley Crüe,&quot; Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in supporting in a nursery a doll representing Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who has recently presented a portion of &quot;my Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; Charlie Sheen, as Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Alongside Anderson and Peters, the special programme Noel CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is itself not far from the controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &apos; bitch &apos; American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan Returns after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP increased 1.5% through domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral of the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, yet still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses at $300000 million, which, despite the difficult global context, appears to be mitigated. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page: GDP has raised a 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% annualized. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> That the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non-interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based solely on the Keynesian stimulus which invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan woke up largely thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of GDP in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable has raised a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and entertainment activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo was handed over to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become a &quot;haven&quot; elected by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in eurozone and unrest forecasts United States, a privilege that hangs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a divided stronger products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September, the contribution of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral EU countries, the Government Yoshihiko Noda not drop our guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must follow the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Policy Economics, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) said that the majority of the member countries have submitted in September more clear signals of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the global economy has highlighted that the major powers have been curbed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Because it fell four decimal places up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Even eurozone was below average, which is located in the 100, n dropping eight decimal up to 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens again fueling doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives sign no written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the peripheral risk premia triggered uncertainty and relocated in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional government Helennic; rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos signalled yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days sets in his appointment may be short, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated its demand for new elections for the scheduled date of February 19. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reforming the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras No emerging doubts about its position: &quot;we are committed to assisting the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leader has gone a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, agencies must unlock the 8000 million that Athens requires urgent and clearly said that it will not approve any letter adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by the whole referendum Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign a written undertaking without ambiguities as soon as possible. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would &quot;very quickly&quot; in Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8000 million, even if there is a definite date. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek still have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The Queen Sofía: &quot;they are instruments for the progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen stresses the &quot;dominant&quot; Spain regarding this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Spain has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of the Micro-Finance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the past two decades the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation that the &quot;essence&quot; lies in the fact that it is &quot;a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all of humanity, based on confidence in the human being.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen opened yesterday the V-E World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid with certainty that &quot; there is no doubt &quot; that such operations are &quot; absolutely essential &quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &quot; very specifically, for the purpose of reducing half the volume of people living with incomes below a dollar a day, which is the &quot; poverty line .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Spain continues to work&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries in all corners of the globe, and assumes the task with &quot;responsibility,&quot; said Queen Sofía, who had hoped that the initiatives and origins contributions during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, &quot;guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women,&quot; the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have achieved a lot of objectives &quot; and &quot; we are facing many challenges. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit of microcredit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which we must initiate &quot;two basic goals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, Her Majesty has explained that the aim is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they live now. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the trail started a few years ago a pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofía as an &quot;act of justice and recognition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she described the father of this instrument as an &quot;admirable idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty,&quot; which she is known since 15 years ago, when the Queen has travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground its lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings like those celebrated in Côte d &apos;Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I have seen a continuing evolution,&quot; said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave him yesterday the adjective &quot;head of the family&quot; convened at Valladolid on the part of the &quot;banking for the poor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofía has finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Minister of External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the &quot;solidarity is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a &quot;permanent obligation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that microcredit involves &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&quot; and &quot;now more than ever,&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow that it is the victim of cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the &quot; success &quot; to &quot; give confidence to people &quot; excluded all close the door &quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of Riva, welcomed those present in a city that &quot; opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the president of the European universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, was held without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democrat party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally planned programme but has imposed in the autumn, including activists who consider the government&apos;s policy is too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> On 1001 delegates, only nine were against and 10 abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation for several minutes that were right at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile finance minister, left no room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The focus of the Chancellor - and the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the fiscal policies of the countries in the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage &quot;in order to give a face to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is in any case, one of the proposals of the motion passed by the congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Admittedly, it is unlikely that the EU27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone is asked. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority, the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> To defuse the atmosphere inside his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But it has not sought to earn its congress on the backs of small European countries or countries in difficulty, quick to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of the &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that there are two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The fraud sick? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments disease. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance, and deliver a speech on the recurring theme - since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social handouts. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First of all for the purpose of budget savings: the government plans to impose on employees of a private deficiency fourth day before taking charge of a work stoppage. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without a specific agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of wages, so at least 15% of its monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure which could provoke anger, but that would bring EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic significance: impose a day to officials of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a work stoppage (they have not so far waiting period, against three days in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunch the thematic fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to the work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The checks will be much more important, and, if you are caught, you will pay,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand in micro RTL, Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> It is the subject since 2002 of a constant monitoring and offensive policies, which have often borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> We hung up first on the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million daily allowances were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, daily allowances represented in 2008 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46 percent were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were sick, or 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And, therefore, 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have averaged 14.5 days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the site management career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40000 French employees surveyed reported having no sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time from health insurance, said that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were less than 8 days, 22 per cent from 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, the French workers are no more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) hovered in France between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud judgments disease represents very little in the face of the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As for fraud, it reached only a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of legislation since 2002 that the controls are systematic disease judgments of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of 285000 made for short were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; either 37050. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11 per cent of cases &quot;inappropriate or unjustified&quot; on 1.2 million, 132000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total, therefore 169000 &quot;unjustified&quot; case, millions of employees who had a sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents little face, for example, the moonlighting. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, or more than the total cost of the daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more fraud. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This was stated on Monday November 14, the prime minister, Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme,&quot; said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the &quot;primary task&quot; of the new government, because the country&apos;s participation in the euro zone &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly, Mr. Papadémos has projected that the deficit in the country will be reduced to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right refuses new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, made Monday its support for the measures already agreed to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not engage on an additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favour of new measures,&quot; he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He said he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and to fight waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Has Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU débloqueraient not loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he will sign nothing under external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, health care institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian company lives in denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor the conditions in which they want to die and take measures to that effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts linked to a variety of areas, including ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is needed, with a patient deemed competent to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medicalization or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths at the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&apos;s authors arrive at conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation leads to abuse, that is to say the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on not competent or not consenting persons. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, said yesterday in a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, would be more cases of these outbursts precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; says Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians support euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people who practiced assisted suicide, surveyed feel 41% that they should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> Peacekeeping or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The expert committee also requested that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, health care institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reserves other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts &apos; report of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> I am Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called &quot;extreme&quot; position experts signatories of the report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask what assistance to commit suicide,&quot; said Ms. Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Deschamps me also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> However, &quot;in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist health law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, which she called &quot;clear pro-euthanasia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave power </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Damascus denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Syria is increasingly isolated </seg>
<seg id="2556"> Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday before the Department of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against the country. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria, have taken a stand in favour of a departure of President Assad. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;leave the power&quot; in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime&apos;s forces have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;If Bashar had committed to the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics,&quot; said the King of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> &quot;Those who are not in the Middle East peace with their people and cannot meet the will,&quot; he said, alluding to Syria, neighbouring countries to which Turkey adopts an increasingly hard line. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The United States are on their side welcomed a &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime,&quot; after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> &quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey to adopt an increasingly harsh tone&quot; in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have died in the region of Deraa in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH). </seg>
<seg id="2566"> Two other civilians were killed &quot;in crossfire and shelling with heavy machine guns to Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem has estimated that the country was heading &quot;towards the end of the crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2568"> He has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its work, which he said was &quot;a dangerous step.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Syria &quot;will not falter,&quot; he added, assuring that &quot;the plots hatched against Syria will fail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2570"> After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a &quot;mechanism to protect civilians&quot; and sending 500 members of Arab organizations for human rights, media and military observers in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for sending observers to the United Nations to help protect civilians of the repression of the regime that he is &quot;paranoia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2572"> A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the peace plan agreed on November 2, including the withdrawal of forces cities plagued by the challenge and the release of protesters arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, ruled yesterday &quot;incorrect&quot; the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan out of the crisis, while refraining from supporting sanctions against Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Italy </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices Italians </seg>
<seg id="2576"> The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time for markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain &quot;sacrifices&quot; to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before today&apos;s meeting with trade unions and employers. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> It should establish a firm relatively small composed of technocrats outside Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> &quot;Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Mr Nucara, member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the Council president-designate. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part said expect Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The consultations will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti a shortlist, probably a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Mr Monti commented nervousness equity and bond markets yesterday, asking their time. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> &quot;Democracy, there are clear deadlines&quot; to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying &quot;certain that the markets will be patient and understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2584"> His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern has been especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro zone in September. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The designated prime minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include &quot;political.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Mr Monti is committed, once in office, to work in the urgency and purpose that Italy &quot;become protagonist&quot; in Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a workable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The IAEA last week expressed its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to ISIS, largely from IAEA document, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a centre Soviet military nuclear Chelyabinsk (Urals), and have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 and 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing &quot;nano-diamonds&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic problems of its society would have led to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It would then have cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its latest report, the IAEA evokes &quot;strong indications that the development by Iran of a&quot; nuclear detonation system &quot;has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only familiar with this technique, but as a member state has informed the Agency has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of its country of origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2604"> The crimes and anti-Muslim crimes have increased by 50% </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, the other racial and religious violence has fallen slightly or little progress, according to statistics from the FBI made public Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes and anti-religious. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; very slightly to 6628 cases, of which 47.3% motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again,&quot; said the human rights organization Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,&quot; the organization added in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US government can and must do more to address these abuses,&quot; he says, believing that it could go through improved police reports on the &quot;hate crimes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The &quot;hate crime&quot; in the US federal law is a legacy of the struggle for civil rights. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Inclusion of a &quot;golden rule&quot; in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The government of Social Democrat/Christian Democrat coalition in power in Austria decided Tuesday to include in the constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple-A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann has even announced the decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the creditworthiness of Austria was lowered one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay EUR 3 billion in interest every year,&quot; argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria is responding to a request from the Brussels summit of member countries of the euro zone of 26 October: heads of state and government had claimed the listing by the end of 2012, the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the &quot; German model ,&quot; Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> By 2017, the structural public deficit will decrease each year by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal government should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities will have to submit balanced budgets. </seg>

<seg id="2631"> Strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threat of a new intervention in the foreign exchange market </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will do as we did last time if we see an excessive volatility&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, Mr Noda explained to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo has sold massively yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record since 1945 against the greenback. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen is regularly since recovered, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar rose Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it increases the cost of goods made in Japan and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert the national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot; Japan struggle to rebuild since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku northeast), Mr Noda stressed that the rise of the yen does not kill the fragile recovery in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption sealed by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister has ruled that the yen&apos;s prices did not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part, has called on the Bank of Japan inject), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the inject had already taken &quot;appropriate measures,&quot; suggesting that no further monetary easing was expected Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> At its last meeting in late October, the institute emissions increased by 5000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bonds, to 55000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the maximum amounts that it devotes to purchases of various financial securities for flooding the market with liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Euro area: </seg>

<seg id="2649"> The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines the European indices. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue their ascent. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, Europe&apos;s stock markets sink in a little more negative territory Tuesday, 15 November. </seg>

<seg id="2654"> &quot;With the new tensions on the bond yields of the states of the euro zone in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn, renewed fears of market players about Europe&apos;s ability to contain the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, like the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor variations as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds among Ichiyoshi Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> This renewed concerns over the future of the euro zone penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro is changing at its lowest level in a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Around 10.00 a.m., the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollar decline of 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to brokers, it has fallen after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country struggling to emerge from the eurozone without leaving the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain very worrisome levels. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bond reached 6.85%, Spanish titles of maturity of 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the future government of Italy, Mario Monti has demanded time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October would be the &quot;primary task&quot; of his government. </seg>

<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of growth figures for the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Statistics aside, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 per cent, driven by household consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> INSEE has, however, revised downwards the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And it truly is the fourth most concern economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, meanwhile, grew by 0.5% over the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> A first estimate for the whole of the eurozone is expected at 11.00 a.m., while the European Commission has warned against the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts must outweigh the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is one issue that we cannot treat from short-term considerations and emotion, it is the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and business competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that an election date is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place is nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinion on objective facts, sound data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic trends will lead to a doubling of demand of electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge part of the global population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce the electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, a subject disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is the case of Belgium, which makes hers on the need to be able to find an alternative source of alternative or Switzerland, which will no longer just build that last generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, are continuing their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States have decided after Fukushima to add a unit at their park by resuming the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality irks the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will translate into a rise in the price of electricity, energy dependence, exacerbated by the increasing reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas-fired power plants and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to entertain. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champions of wind, it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity is 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice of electricity of 40 per cent more than the French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on national territory, French companies are benefiting from the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the illusory fine declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and defending the purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Recall that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial sector of 125000 jobs directly and 410000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strong exports, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes the very job-creating non-transferable. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing alarmingly the EUR 6 billion annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electrician would dictate an EPR designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of generating electricity miracle, it is diabolical. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva solutions low-CO2, nuclear and renewable, testifies to the complementarity of power sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For nuclear energy, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a security controls intransigent and transparent on existing plants as the Flamanville site. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operation; he remained without human and environmental consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> Chernobyl was the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> For Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the PRT presents a design making it capable of withstanding such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a power station, the judgment of its construction at Flamanville is a magnificent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF leaves the way open to grab the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate debate as critical to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - congestion police, judicial and administrative services subject to political figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed country status of human rights &quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who made the news, the interior minister (read Liberation of 23 May) declaring that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is rarely discussed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Right, the tone has been given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that &quot; 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers, and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot; cannot accommodate all the misery of the world &quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the level of generosity that we be prepared to pay towards immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande is confined to banalities, indicating that the co-development will solve our immigration problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a problem, perhaps pay electorally; but it is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the economists recall Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restricting immigration anaemic growth and night employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Fears vis-à-vis the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can substitute for domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary substitutes for national employees, performing mostly trades in shortage areas of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon will find it hard to work in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real wages in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And without taking into account the fact that diversity made by immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that an immigrant in Germany, arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (less revenue expenditure) of EUR 150000 public budgets on average over the whole of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, fetching points missing growth &quot;with teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Teeth, serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy remains suggest European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember him for having invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, has experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but Franco in Spain, Portugal, Salazar colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some may have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy triomphât definitively its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the exercise of the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> You know, since Napoleon &quot;Petit,&quot; it was an easy thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage for the necessary condition for democracy, there is not enough and may even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as previously said the philosopher Etienne Republican Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Europe&apos;s crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is equally and primarily a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The palinodie of true-false Greek referendum will be held in this regard double litmus test: the need for a powerful return policy, but also the unsettling feeling of its inability to its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of combat democratic today are displaced, and that many of them, Republicans soldiers are no longer in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums held in necessities and disorganised. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank cheque to European absolute monarch or a leap into the void of nationalist reaction: what choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want sunset but an exercise, common, right, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - cannot be more where stop &quot; list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe which pander to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to restore popular sovereignty piloting the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at the European level that can be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Having long fought this proposal socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> . </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But the thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and seen as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new stage of European integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> For the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;make&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution in interests could suffice. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a more integrated Europe economically. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This cannot be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political front, a genuine European popular sovereignty. </seg>

<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 should be completed on an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The fastest growing segment is the contactless technology that allows paying public transport or settle its purchases simply approaching the card reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year, 460 million contactless smartcard should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share is expected to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card (6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Long the laggard of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75000 payment terminals accept it. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400000 without contact Visa cards have been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But supermarkets put out all the stops. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Crossroads has issued this year by 2.5 million cards Pass contactless MasterCard. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To move up a gear, it is now that banks equip their clients. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two big French institutions have pledged to distribute future systematically to their customers &apos; bank cards equipped for the contact,&quot; says Gerard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment by mobile </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Few devices are now equipped with technology NFC (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They have fallen behind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they should finally have a real boom next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We rely on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world,&quot; says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks are taking the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The Agricultural Credit yesterday announced the launch of a test to June next December at Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone of some 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a holster authorizing the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the General Society also said yesterday preparing the marketing of an offer to allow its customers to pay without contact with their mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> The Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Suspected longstanding ties between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now &quot;satisfied.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which the two organizations operate and reports of intelligence services show that there is cooperation,&quot; he said without explanation. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to make a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would be uncovered. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should be killed the next day at the same time that several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of calls moving towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Niger man who has stayed at length in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a step forward, but we should probably expect more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;It has known for years that the sect has external financial support and intellectuals and that she is increasingly active,&quot; tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months, these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and bill than those used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of beaming little of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A rapid success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means Hausa &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while its militants engage the fight against the infidels, central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These are first churches, bars, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuja, as usual, unsubtle. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Therefore the sect will radicalise and leave his northern strongholds. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> This Christmas, it claims an attack which 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram blames HQ secure police during a suicide attack, its first. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria worries now all security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, that Somalis al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all information. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to the Republican presidential candidates </seg>
<seg id="2831"> On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete superficiality and ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other growing thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsubstantiated - abound. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the &quot; Grand Old Party, has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and cause &quot; to manipulate their currency, &quot; a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of large swathes of its industry to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Too bad if it must involve the onset of a trade war, &quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China, Obama and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy threatened to strangle facing an attitude that &quot;gloat&quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which has stagnated in the depths of the polls, remains muted. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The image of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he fanfaronné.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is elected, they will have the bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations vis-à-vis the partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best placed candidate, displays a embarrassing lack of files. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, he called to counter the military threat China because Beijing is trying to develop a nuclear capability &quot; - apparently unaware of the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964! </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the American army in Mexico against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> It is far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan had also simple ideas and he has won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to put water in its wine counter. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran on the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, its procrastination in Libya, sticky and a small label. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attack is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> People judge rather positive assessment of national security to Obama, who has eliminated Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> In Iraq, it is wary of military intervention that led to the stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, arguing that there is a need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more fair. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, a new door ntrée Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glamor. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests including four heads of state and government attended last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and end buffet at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline which connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Netherlands Mark Rutte turned the wheel of the valve commander entry of Russian gas in the western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in western Europe by a first tube of 1224 km linking the St. Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, for a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And it raises the possibility of constructing a third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge site looks like victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding overland passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut access to West European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new German-Soviet pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the topic is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is the price of a weakening of Europe&apos;s energy, since the project has created a gap between people of East and West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In Russia, five years ago, upholding his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries strongly gas consumers, whose deposits are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically,&quot; François Fillon confirmed in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine is steel wrapped with concrete to protect against the anchors of ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It was also necessary to step up measures to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: neither valve or station maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A platform check was off the coast of Sweden, but project officials have abandoned while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company settle permanently off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline is therefore released into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned to hear a leak every 100000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Monitoring the condition of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship for external observation, as well as a device that is circulating inside the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The form of a cigar, it is brought inside the tube, broad one metre in diameter, and it is driven by gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres second book accurate information on the possible distortions of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without any compensation. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The flow of gas is simply provided by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bars at the outset, and 100 upon arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to realize this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then leased to the company for 20 years renewable, the entire building gas transmission. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas really transported,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline was assured 30% by shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a book. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It was established 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It smacks of adventures, hours to write in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular coverage, elastic, leaves a white, as outdated by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, a consultant for the company, the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book is based on an ancient technique of production, the mole skin (skin mole) designates a cotton varnish used to cover benches. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of book was very popular writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has been revived an old and forgotten, who was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the brand in Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is there. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces passed. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> It is far from confidential production years, where only 3000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to establish a composite picture of the buyer, because the notebook seduced both the businessman that students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices, one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in bookstores, Fnac small shops downtown and was able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the air time and this new writing, despite the growth of e-mails,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched a &quot;detour&quot; exhibition where architects and artists expose their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it has also launched a leopard coverage, on the occasion of the Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, covers computer... The mark takes on a whole range of materials. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that has made envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities remains so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9 percent for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, said Eric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made since 15 years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;There is still a great deal to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, obstacles remain before access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Rather, they are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the box and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, criteria that makes the return to employment, and &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to recruit workers with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the brakes objectives. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> The rest unsaid, attitudes are changing, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Undertake Precinct indicated that managers interviewed &quot;a low level of awareness of disability,&quot; with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, emotional or intellectual disabilities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest figures known, dating from 2008, a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, director general of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The evidence: the number of &quot;taxed&quot; institutions, like the amounts paid decreased between 2007 and 2011, 59000 to 46000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot; The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on companies, &quot; says Pierre Blanc. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this also reflects a real awareness, particularly in large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 percent of establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of businesses from 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before tackling the Bleus Tuesday evening (20.45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that gives them this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We will not go so far as to say that there was complicity between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the gesture mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise to do about it. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I am very glad to Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to go forward,&quot; assures the Lillois. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> On the contrastre between its club and selection, &quot;it is a whole, if it is justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;Lille, I am throughout the year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;I must take my marks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Spared against Romania on Friday night for the game against France, Hazard comes at Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> But omit the notion of &quot;fun.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2970"> The Bleus, he encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I have always been bear,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Inevitably, it contributes to further strengthen the &quot;special nature&quot; of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Given that, &quot;there is Mathieu Debuchy (), Yohan Cabaye () and Adil Rami (),&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We sat just now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;To play against them, it is only happiness!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With bonhomie, Leekens, for its part, has spoken of the &quot;pride.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; contest &quot;a gala match.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; also - as a &quot;neighbor&quot; that France is &quot;become a very high-level team&quot; a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc was a work of thunder,&quot; he enthused. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well share the plane with the direction... Bleus Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our small Belgians are great,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We are in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You are going into account in future matches.&quot; One against France included. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> Portugal&apos;s Paulo Bento begins with great optimism returning barrage against Bosnia (10.00 p.m.), this Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> The move, the two teams had been realistic. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
