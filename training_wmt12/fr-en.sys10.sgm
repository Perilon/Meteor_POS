<seg id="1"> The Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the penal right, the project of cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the boss of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The representatives refused in second reading the project of modification aiming the reduction of the penalties for economical offences, that could have opened the doors of the liberty for the former currently imprisoned Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to have concluded an agreement to disadvantageous priori with the Russia for the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the call of the condemned in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymosenko qualifies the judgement of vengeance politics of the system and provoked a process of suspicions of partiality of the court equally to the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of the penal right, on the basis of which the former premère Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 representatives. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The liberation or Libyan rebellion already has its overcome ones. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is finished. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There remains to determine the conquerors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As it is custom in the region, the conquerors to the elections are the Islamists, but it is a question of the moderated or radical. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The provisional National Counsel decreed the habitual right of the Charia and we already know of what it is a matter. </seg>

<seg id="19"> But our manner to live is not unique, is not objectively the better one and would not be probably advantageous for the Libyan. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is particularly astonishing that the Islamist warriors accepted the assistance with recognition of the unfaithful dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only excuse it is that this is not a general américian that directed the hit with NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the magnitude to every attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When it is a matter therefore to look for the conquerors in Libya, the west not in left fact </seg>
<seg id="23"> We participated in the shooting, served the Islam and our poilitiques diverted themselves dictator as political ally without that doing not bring any profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the bad recent experiences of THE Afghanistan and the Iraq, we occupy not militarily the Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It not there therefore any problem for the local ones of itself débarasser of the &quot;crossed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Is what without occupation of the ground, the oil corporations easily will have accés to black gold libyien. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The obese nutrition of a child: does not take any breakfast not and takes delicatessen for the dinner </seg>
<seg id="78"> More of a third of the children of 9 to 13 years have problems of surpoids, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As the watches the current research the obese children originate families that have a style of unhealthy life. </seg>
<seg id="80"> That shows again to which not at is all important the environment in which evolves the human being and the models that the surround. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of the obese children one finds for example delicatessen 50% more often than in the families of children to the normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of the obese ones had french fries to the dinner according to the conducted investigation with an action of sensibilisation &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of the small big one the sport is not equally a habit, which is now the case of most of the pupils of today - only 15% replied that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Investigate conducted on 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The investigation unfolded itself during the last school year and participated 900 students of the primary schools of Czech. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot;, action sustained by the general Assurance of health and the corporation Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the beginning it is more than 12000 students of sixth one to the third one that registered themselves to this project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The one of the determining factors that provoke a dramatic increase of the number of children in surpoids, indeed obese, is l&apos;absence,d&apos;une nutrition correct and not enough physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only the half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times a day breakfast in case - to eat - to taste- to dine, that is the one basic principles of a good nutrition&quot;, indicates the one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and delicatessen to the dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> The specialists attract the attention on the Fact that to have a healthy development it is necessary some basic details such as a breakfast in family to the same hour. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In Czech, only 23% of the families of the students eat to the my same hour. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the major party of the families each takes his only breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worse one that was raised is than a tenth one of the population not at all takes any breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is nevertheless the basis of a good daily nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children one consumes more often unhealthy french fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every student - to say nothing of the weight - drunk every day of the sweetened drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> More than 40% of the questioned children does the sport uniformly but for the parents it is a matter of the half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Prepare you your nutrition </seg>
<seg id="100"> A somewhere else investigation allowed children choose (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own nutrition from proposed possibilities according to their taste own and their personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of the Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, to the healthy plan of a nutrition, ideal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of cakes, meats and of sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The most alarming one is notably a big preference for the sweetened lemonades&quot;, is indicated in the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For the lunch it is the pasta that took the first just place in front of white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The children not at all have desired of starchy and the preference for the fish and the vegetable meals was very weak. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Cape on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The investigation showed equally that the children are ready to change their habits from the moment where they receive the news ad hoc. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;During a check of a group of participants to the investigation that had filled the questionnaire after the meeting of sensibilisation&quot; Obesity is not a chance&quot;, one has assité to a well determined will to direct itself towards a healthy nutrition&quot;, indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The more marking was for example for what concerns the sweetened lemonades for the children began giving the preference to consumer water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and the fish as principal dish and would reduce the sweetened dishes and the &quot;knedliky&quot; (Czech spécialté of pellets of flour of bread or of potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The styliste must be equally a good psychologist, say the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In a presentation item relating to the manner to learn for the stylistes, I put myself a small little in anger on account of the fact that there were some a lot as early as the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I did not do not think about which was going to arrive afterward. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The expositions of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the personages and a seminary on what happens on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Let&apos;s more approach the final examinations and do more await us exercises practice and of the news. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses the Saturdays and Sundays this is truly &quot;stuffed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the director Alenka (to the course there is not any boy) treated of the manner to dress the woman that does not have any standard mensurations. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type this is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> The one has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without special bend, another of the surpoids. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The styliste must know how optiquement ammenuiser of the wide arms, extend a neck or well to add necessary bends. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrived thus to underline nicely the personage and equally to not to dress in a manner too visionary of the types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips of such manner that the skirts or the not past pants of the tout,cela is worth the blow of itself to be done it to do on measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you will not regret it for the clothing that impeccably falls is inestimable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt on measure you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips in permanence, winds itself and does not hold to the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For the one that have a masculine appearance were able to allow themselves a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or well again embroideries. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are evidently a lot of examples d &apos;various appearances and I am satisfies that I have the very week to sort all received the news. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I have equally fear that had consideration to what I must do to the house there are some too. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Every trainee reçut a fame to dress for the day and the evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take in consideration the current appearance, the type of method of the personality as well as his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will have &quot;to dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know country the Secret of Victoria. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At the far end of me, that pleases me, for it is better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera that took almost hundred kilos the latter times (do not take my declaration, please, completely to the serious one) or well the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sew from the magazines or look for on internet, print and work the graphics. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard,comme one says for the final result, expresss our personal style as well as our relation with the graphic creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Reflect equally on the graphic party of the styling is equally important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The dressed styliste not thus only the physics but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on given products the tendencies for the bags to hand, the coats, etc. ..). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, styliste and graphic designer, we maintained of all that. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But that, ... to the Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The styliste must have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three guests of the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the meeting of full Saturday of information on the different types of personages. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, styliste, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of method and Well Renc, method photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub recalled us that the method is an illusion and the styliste should know to use it. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talent styliste knows to work with a single in a manner different clothing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variability is for this essential example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As for example this trench-coat that has itself to be carried in a manner classical with a John and a t shirt as a light coat but also it can dress equally the nude body, with pumps and to take it in photo as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or well it suffices to climb back up the sleeves or the collar and to have immediately a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with that&quot; it underlined. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I particularly appreciated the following counsel: &quot;For the work need to know you the rules perfectly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You next can begin to there to contravene&quot;, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why one strives to learn these rules, what to do with, towards what, why, while in the method magazines one see sometimes something of other. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No declaration on the method parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, thanks to the method photographer Well that the styliste must have a lot more variants of clothing than the one that are photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (therefore about ten models) I must be ready to in &quot;to recut&quot; at least a group of fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, a clothing and his combination with of other elements appear completely differently that in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with that during a creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The Fact that the picture and the style do sometimes the half of the succés was confirmed us by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> It suffices to look at Madonna that is not a great singer but his picture and marketing did a world-wide star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Czech, the approach towards the usage of the services of the stylistes still remains frileuse. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it suffices that I know something but which I adorned passes to the second row). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone is done to do a styling on our part, we next must count on the Fact that it dictates ourselves with a big probability a completely different size (smaller) that the one that it has in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It we remain next that to sail on google and to assure itself if boulevard infos mention the fame in question, if she slimmed or increased etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario put us Sunday on the heart qu &apos;it does not suffice for the styliste to orient itself in the method and know assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> It must communicate with the people that it dresses and it is thus important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Know guess the people, do not flatter itself, preserve his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When one to manage asks you of him to sort his closet and to fill it again elements you not all can throw and him dire,Mon God which horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find some matters that you will find pretty and him that you will counsel with what to carry them&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> This one concretely showed us what all must contain what one calls the &quot;placovka&quot; or bag of the styliste. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is the one that you hang around the size and that you have on oneself for all that of which need you. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Besides the clearly defined things as the scissors, the rolls for hair loss or well again the pins to wet nurse, one there finds also wire of nylon (that the styliste uses to photograph products as bags, or several hats), special pop videos with which these one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too big (the pin or other type of clasp are not utlisables for they could damage The clothing) or well a kit of sewing. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For that we soyions not only of the people that listen but that tried in a manner practical something they taught us how ressemeller correctly of the shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the meeting photo in the workshop where the surface is equals, the sole could damage itself, to fortiori to lextérieur. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And thus stuck us and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We did not have the right to touch the scissors for not to injure itself by oversight. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is necessary therefore truly competences. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario pleased me when it congratulated me for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The comptence of which I do state is not for my friend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course </seg>
<seg id="178"> I begin more and more to understand than to do the styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that each in says what it wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The speed need The Run disputes itself through any America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Revision </seg>
<seg id="181"> To the origin a race without problem transforms itself because of a body of stupid errors of people that not some have anything to do in a stuck one in a rut morning movement to the work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> That fills until a certain measure the ambition of each but that does not serve to anything if no one wants to do more something. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new subtitled party The Run produced big expectations before his exit. </seg>
<seg id="184"> It promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already elderly and go out a game sort from the playable parties that would count itself not only with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were therefore curious how will be the added passages to the course of which ones the principal hero goes out of his car and does what it wants. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As that is done already in the series NFS, the result is completely other that which one atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It is potentially games of race of arcades but the body pulls towards the bottom because of some useless faults that already exist for a number of years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> This are not really errors but rather the incomprehensible expression of a laziness from the developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You took in the adventure of which the principal hero Jack has disturbed problems and to regulate them begins participating in illegal races through America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the flying one on the coast west to San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first one to New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The itinerary is divided in ten steps and next in more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Which in results that every race is done on another itinerary and the foreseen steps in different environments that distinguish themselves enough well of one another and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player does not have the feeling a single instant that the game proposes him something identical. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Certain environments are surcroit rather pretty even if the graphic technical level is same type that the preceding series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> At last this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or well in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are in more time in brightened times of an atypical élement. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example in the desert you meet again in a sand storm that diminishes you in a manner sensitive visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains must pay you attention to which an avalanche you fall not over. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Next to that the different races are well arranged behind one another. </seg>
<seg id="203"> It there in has only only a small number but that suffices. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It there instants you strive to surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classical race) then you will run against the watch (classical duel with the stopwatch) and then again you awaits another duel with an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Of time in time have you also the police that enters into the game and that stretched to return you the position dificile. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty are the passages out vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is a matter rather of una organization interactive when most of the time Jack flees in front of someone and you must help it in sharp on the good button at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing of complicate. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is there is less than moments of this type that which you await (to be concrete it there in has only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> To the result it is well as that for this element does not risk bothering and places itself, in the context describes above, in the elements that brighten the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The driving model is in the tradition of the preceding games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Which means that currently it there has nothing extraordinary but one cannot say only it is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> For what concerns realistic simulation will have to go you to see elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But although one can find better in the conccurrence models it driving goes very well with the type of conception of the races. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Therefore all is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems begin appearing after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> To the diffférence of the model of driving, the one of the collisions is not again to the point. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We not await any this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you not have, at the time of a collision with any object, the least idea of the manner in which behaves your car one, this is therefore not completely good. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During squeezed passing you touch yourself sometimes mutually lightly but otherwise your car one leaves in of the fly crazy. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or well meet again in crumbs. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the upturn system that is not really a problem but that annoys you really. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Upturn is done so that when you broke the face or you took out in the setting the game brings back you at the last point on the itinerary. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you dispose only only of 5 upturns. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you used the 5 upturns must recommence you the game since the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> This is therefore more a tool, for the case where something not happens as it faut,que quelquechose on which truly can count you. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes upturns do not help and it is necessary to find the solution in itself memory remémorrant the itinerary piece in question. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The big snag of this game it is that the same actions meet again in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example there are certain bends that it is necessary to pass of a certain manner otherwise that does not pass. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you meet on a given place of the vehicles &quot;civil&quot; still in the same configuration that you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a late minute. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What gets angry are the positions when you see to pass easily the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, it is necessary for you is to put itself aside and the conturner or well to brake. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is equal if you go to the in front of of him for it is &quot;calculated&quot; of such manner that for the given position it always arrives very close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have again other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During the whole time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without being concerned with the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you to the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> That irritates the more in game end when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent has to any past price in front of you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it passes in front of you it hides you the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter in collision a good number of time. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something of captivate and a lot of adrédaline,mais it is clear that you are bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And what a pity for through a model of simple driving the game is interesting and the places with so many action as you do not have the time to follow all that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And it is equal if it is because of the unique concept of 50 itineraries, that the order of the races is such as there is not any luck to be bored or well something of other. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the car change during the races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must pay attention to the gas pumps on the itineraries for you there can change car nevertheless most of the time the one that you sufficed yourself. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided in three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sport cars are ideal for the cities, the American top athletes for the upright expressways and the great cars of sport to the exotic finery on very technical drivings for example on the roads in lace in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And the challenge method, that are races in special places that you know adventure, goes very well with the principal system of the history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> You receive not only of the give an award to but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and to the adventure. </seg>
<seg id="246"> When you attained the highest level of driver, different objects begin unlocking itself: </seg>
<seg id="247"> This one connects itself one line with the function Autolog that among others compares your obtained results with those of other players and you obtain other functions in the community. </seg>
<seg id="248"> The one of the blows more difficult to understand is the position of the last race of the adventure. </seg>
<seg id="249"> You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (that resembles) where you roll in the obscurity on the ways (that resembles). </seg>
<seg id="250"> Your speed informer indicates you between 150 and 200 km/hours (to priori) and behind you arrive a subway oar that sends you the car directly to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="251"> To the compilation we had a discussion during some days to knowledge if someone actually reflected at the time of the creation of this game or well if the authors take us really for fools. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical party of the game is not extra,mais left it visual is in pleasant general rule and in certain really great cases. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What bothers is in more extreme positions, the not held imagery the level and in certain in a manner tragic cases. </seg>
<seg id="254"> That concerns especially the accidents with a big number of participants when a fluid imagery does not serve you more to anything. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sonorous party is good and the track is at the choice. </seg>
<seg id="256"> With the intention of to please the biggest number and particularly the more to the young public a new sonorous track was created in the style &quot;I mix all&quot;, but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game did not have these stupid errors could say us without fear that it is a matter of the better production of NFS the latter years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But this game gives the not impression to be finished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Entertainment is really well but prepare you to what the faults type you in the eyes with the force of a reflector of airfield. </seg>

<seg id="282"> Madam Vicenova paid homage to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Counsel. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;As early as the beginning resounded the critics that it is flat, that it is a round one-of-leather, that it do not can rempplir any mission and I must say that it cut the breath to everyone for it holds his role to the perfection&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="312"> History of a brand: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of his existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone had to look for the term that expresss to the most near the strategy IBM, the closest one would be &quot;the long term&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a public wide IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a felt firm as very current and nevertheless since his creation it flowed himself hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this strategy in the long term was thrown by the first boss of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It left this slogan that a big number of world-wide problems can be regulated for little that the people are desirous to reflect. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;THINKS &apos;! &quot;became the impression around which will develop the gigantic life of a future (and also the title of the internal magazine as IBM began editing in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the business soignement elaborated by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> For us IBM means a thought in the long term of continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived hundred years thanks to the Fact that she always remained faithful to its basic values and nevertheless was not afraid of to change all the others around her. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, the business and the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century will attain ourselves again more&quot; has délaré for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A well prepared system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the thirties, put itself to take care of its employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have the paid vacation, an assurance paid by the employer more a uniform of elegant employee and a well elaborated system of reward for the inventors and the commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Same manner IBM has a relation sytème with the well elaborated customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The corporation was at first inspired in the talent discovery- as the one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since this will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - that should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> This one works with IBM for thirty years and occupies currently the post of Boss of the Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM during the last years done which one calls jamy, brain- online storming from what are originating from a lot of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not astonishing that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm there is close to 500000 people that work. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is the internal and external picture the business that assure him a sure position in the domains of the matters. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the at the beginning of IBM had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm&quot;, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, economy Professor to the School of economy of Harvard and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to resolve problems of the world of the business while using his technology&quot;, added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the says the firm itself there is a difference between to enter on the market and to create this market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or well the &quot;Blue Big&quot;, as her familiarly is called for the United States had consideration to his slogan- in hundred years she grew until to become the one of the bigger world-wide firms. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is evidently the technological firm the most polyvalent - she develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services of Counsel at the level of the products of the waiter to the nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> She possesses many patents of all the American technological firms and five of its employees received a price Nobel. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its discoveries arranges themselves for example the bills distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the code blocks or well the diskette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM met again this year with 220 billion dollars the second bigger technological firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first one is Apple), when for the first time she surpassed in 1996 Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Noticed in advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> This are not all the innovations and manufactures that had the preference of the customer and era - IBM for example did not succeed the wager on an own operational system BONE/2, service Prodigy online or well computer IBM PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Has to leave the moment where your business is built on the movement in advance do not can you émotionellement to remain hung on the passed,&quot; points out Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> For that IBM does not have any problem to build its bases on a lot of platforms and when they do not work she leaves. </seg>
<seg id="346"> To the difference for example conccurent Microsoft that to the basis is held and remains under the operational system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> In income IBM, the services, that are formed for a fifth one by software and hardwares, have a preponderant place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Nevertheless again in 1990 she was with more motié of participation the more representing fort of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000 IBM sold active to weak yield for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period she invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of technologies perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="351"> She continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time she surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, that during the big economical crisis equally increased his investment volume. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Being it apparait henceforth that past IBM the current crisis without worried? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The price of the action IBM has progessé from 2008 some burst out of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the firm IBM is to change all but not its values. </seg>

<seg id="471"> Divided into volumes Plekanec did not transform anything of their attacks. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is the Fact that the rear line was sick that especially embarrassed the local entraineur rather than of the breaks through lost for they played the game only with 5 defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;It is null&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played the game only with an experienced player, the remainder this were young&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But it n &apos;there has nothing to do, this is as that &quot;, says Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacement on replacement that did not suffice and we were not able to withstand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We just airplanes to simplify the game, to push the disc outside our zone&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="480"> 5 different marksmen participated uax goals of the Throws, that stopped a series of 5 lost matches. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How evolved the prices of the trips since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Up to 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 agencies of trip of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The trip agencies to this era proposed trips especially in the countries of the socialist pad, for the trips to the west were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists traveled for the vacation in Germany of the East, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimée and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (the two at sea Black) and in Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A big exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel in Yugoslavia then the system began having an inclination for the west and the trips towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The big paradox of the socialist era was that it not authorized nétait for the citizens of the socialist pad (also for the Czechoslovak ones) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union it is necessary for him an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not authorized. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The trip agencies to this era offered also trips to the West nevertheless it was necessary to do the tail the very night with a bag of sleeping arrangements or to have well a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the trip agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after that this again was not won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the mottos that was the condition to travel to the west was refused to the people &quot;politically incorrect&quot; that not at all could trip. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The czechoslovak change was not nevertheless échangeable and it was not possible to obtain from the financial means without the motto agreement (western change) to travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czech ones passed most often their vacation in the country where there were consequently many houses of country and chalets that the Czech ones bought themselves and this habit lasts until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The trips of the Czech ones have since known since 1989 a big revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although up to 1989 the vacation in Germany of the East and Bulgaria were at the Czech maximum,les passed last year abroad 4 millions of days of vacation in the countries of the entire world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The big paradox of which we do not have conscience today it is that the country more popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely up to 1989 left buses of the Yugoslavia of the era. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The suppression of the aimed in the years 90 of the last century in the countries neighbors of the west provoked a huge wave of short-lived visits especially in Austria to Coming and in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechoslovak ones did not can during a long time to travel by airplane to the west that each wanted to see at least an instant. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example to Paris the organizations of trips did to sleep the Czech ones in of the stretched in the parks for our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical trait of a trip of Czech ones was at this era to take with oneself his own food preserve, sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important instant was equally the interchangeabilité of the Czech crown that allowed our tourists at last after the tens of years of freely to be able to buy the western change. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our life level as well as the average salary increased what provoked around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to a growing request for the trips the agencies of trips began since 1997 to prepare turns with liaisons by aerial charter that thanks to contracts tremendouy reduced the costs in comparison with what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the years 90 of the last century the Czech ones had liaisons without aimed with practically most of the developed nations of the entire world to party the HAD that later facilitated our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, when was prepared the first charter one aerial towards an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as each year of the charter aerial one direct take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It is Czech more than 100000 that visit the exotic countries each year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Again an interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17 2008 the HAD eliminated the aimed for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to arrange itself completely in the group of the developed nations. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 equally the Czech ones for the first time in the history passed more half of their vacation abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in the history spent more than 15 000 crowns by person for vacation abroad including the ancillary loads. Crown by person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general assembly must find his President but that risks finishing by a position without solution &quot;a pat&quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> Close to 5MOIS already Czech soccer is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of the Soccer of the Czech Republic again is not known after again a general assembly that must unfold itself Thursday to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Nevertheless it does not exist not yet agreed according to which regulation of vote it is necessary to proceed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement it is not possible to begin voting for the one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Divided into volumes Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure called its colleagues has to unite himself and find a strong personality that will direct the soccer in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek soccer went back towards divergences between the rooms of the Association that cannot come to an agreement on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> That completely showed itself September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the general assembly uselessly met in the national House to Prague for the negotiation remained blocked and it even was not question to treat manner to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> It done not there have agreed on the knowledge fact that has the right to vote to the general assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or well equally the officials invest of full ones be able. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this unique point there was a partial agreement since this instant with the assistance equally of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the full strength is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The divergences always continue about the regulation for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is too clear that the executive committee, that in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not bring anything not more to the position </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinions on the of vote changed several times but the key point always remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed for the third turn in order not to to fall in the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The discord apple lies in the following fact: is to proceed according to the statutes or well to find another models&quot;, noted the one of the three vice presidents of the Association of the soccer of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional soccer within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the foreseen model wins to the third turn the one of the candidates that will have received the more of voice in percentage within the room for which it is candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Moravie is ready according to what one says to withdraw itself for that wins the candidate that will have received the biggest percentage of voice of the two rooms. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech party studies the condition that the conqueror should have the two third at least of the percentages of voice. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only that would do to lose next the preceding idea of two turns and that would do to refuse completely the bicameral concept&quot;, admits Svoboda that understands the objections on the part morave and according to that the more better would be of not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Divided into volumes Paclik is also agreed even if it considers that the regulation of the elections established according to the statutes advantage the more Pelta among all the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I wish that one votes to the maximum according to the statutes of the association&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;For that there is not again crazy ideas imagined by a representative as to the course of the general assembly passed&quot;, declared the owner of Victoria Plzen that is candidate for the first time and that in its expositions defined themselves especially against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimist. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him to Nymburk there will be a new President and raw that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a manner constructive. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everyone&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Soccer will be again on a wave of happiness and it there aure more of liveliness for a cooperation&quot; adds the officer of Jablonec that among the three has the biggest experience regarding direction of so professional soccer than at the regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the position is very stretched&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a problem between the Czech and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations to drawing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;That can provoke again a locking to the general assembly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope all just like the healthy reason will win&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> It does not remain a lot of times for a common agreement to all the parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Certain réuunions should take place directly to the Montenegro but that can say if the very direction of soccer will be completes for the game. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The specially chartered flight in which had to travel to Podgorice among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and one looked for a variant to take a part of the executive committee in the field of reprisals. </seg>
<seg id="545"> To the end it is the ministerial meeting, that could take place Wednesday, that should be determining. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of the education of the youth and sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties within the athletic association the strongest one of the country and to bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there is a lot: an allocation étatique, the credibility of soccer and also the general assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik leaves in battle for the post of President for it does not see any correct candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the boss of the footballers of Plzen Divided into volumes Paclik had seen before the general assembly of which the profile would have replied to all that it asks for a new President of the Association of the soccer of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in country for this high function. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If such a candidate exists I support it, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current position it was not possible to find such a candidate&quot;, declared Paclik to the Agency of Czech press (CTK). </seg>
<seg id="552"> The motivation of Paclik is to enter in competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for exactly to try to prevent Pelta from attain at the head of the AFRT that to priori would be given favorite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik underlines equally that in case it would win the elections it would hold this post of President only up to 2013 foreseen years for a general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> It would see well in the function one to manage experienced and of high level but that is not secured with the world of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I discussed with people that would have the profile&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me that was terrible when certain said me that they did not want to be identified with Czech soccer in this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to let this picture change&quot;, it added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What, says one, bothers especially Paclik is the relation between Pelta and the President of the regional Union of the soccer of Roman Plzen Berbr, man to the famous contreversée that is known in the slides as lobbyist able to influence on the vote of the delegates &apos;the general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If it won, the current state would remain and it would not have nothing new in soccer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of Berbr, that is a merchant of high flight, that would be again less in favor of soccer&quot;, proclaimed Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What shocks it again is the Fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced it there some years during listen in the framework of an investigation on a corruption matter, for which Pelta itself took out some without any pains. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know which prestige Pelta would bring to soccer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how we would be considered to the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA&quot; says Paclik, that declared there is some time &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="565"> If Paclik would prevail to the vote of Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate that had been supported by Paclik before the general assembly of September that had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;It (Pelta) would be the first one with that I would go&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;It has big capacities&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;It would be able to present itself for example as boss of representation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as to manage Association it would not be capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I do not put the nose in what I do not know&quot;, indicates Paclik that in September attracted a big attention when it pronounced himself for the cancellation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik asserts that it would be at the level to direct the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as example its capacities to direct private firms and that it directs equally since last year the club of Plzen that celebrated with his last May support his triumph in first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the force to let something change in the world of the sport and for there to bring a certain culture&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I would brake the influence of certain groups interested that have for example tendency to influence on the disciplinary Commission and of call, which brings to tasteless positions&quot;, added Paclik that not chache his antipathy for the boss of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would envision equally a harmonization of the relations with the Czech olympic Committee of which to be able it lobby with high politics of level would allow obtaining for the sport more of money of the tax on the games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the points keys of which the new President should take care&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it is a matter of the tax on the chance games as the informers the political parties, I understand their lines of argument but they should equally say where goes money&quot;, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not take his current liaison with the club of Plzen as something negative even if asserts itself that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above the parties&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again secured with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not ideal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="582"> I do not see any reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I must return a year and half after&quot;, declared Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised again statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to the positions of pat. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general assembly of the Association of soccer the one of the candidates to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if it is elected, the AFRT will have again statutes that should put fine in the future to the quarrels about the regulation for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday to Nymburk very optimist and thinks that the succés today of the representation of soccer should calm this guéguerre before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election of September that did not realize itself promised exactly to devote itself to national representation and to the achievement of financial means if it is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It made a decision to be candidate to the last moment just before the general assembly passed and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of soccer and to present it in a wide context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people to all the levels do the soccer since a long time and await that Thursday there is a President&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that this is the better moment for than someone takes the direction of the Association&quot;, it adds, but it is before all lion with the club of Jablonec, worked a big number of years to the Sparta and to the executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> It is equally for that that it possesses enough experiences to direct Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is located an euphoria that reigned to lépoque of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately to l&quot; general assembly of June of the statutes were approved that were not perfect as all themselves are noticed some&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there was not all these various interprétattions we already would have had a President since September&quot;, underlines Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is exactly the revision of the document more important of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to some to take all the responsibilities if that does not walk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;This is a principle without which we not can exist&quot;, added Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Next it strives, says one, of not to confront itself to its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It declared earlier that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that it reconnait had consideration to his formation in right and that it knows pertinemment that his opponent candidate would be his first vice President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It not not did more attack since a long time Tonas Paclik that on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It evolves in the soccer since a year and already had some succés.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Its attacks were not nevertheless more honorable and surprised many people during the course of the country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;It is equally for that that some have now doubts on his character&quot;, declared Pelta to the address of his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations that it did in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His weapon more strong is according to him his knowledge of the soccer from the competitions of the lowest one to the réprésentation national level. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a vitirne of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I would strive also to finish all the matters that begin with the one of the Bohémians or well the continuation of the scandal of corruption.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I would enter immediately in negotiations with the public and private sector for that we could obtain enough money for the whole soccer&quot;, declared to the Agency of Czech press CTK the 46th candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> It also added as his nomination at the head of not affable soccer any change of people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should do knowledge with all the employees&quot;, it declared to Strahov where reigns an understandable nervousness since that it not there any direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are disastrous scénarii foreseen with the general assembly, it thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If there is a single point of discord on the manner to vote to the third turn we will arrive to surpass it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Soccer needs credibility and it will obtain it only when there will be at his head a new leader&quot;, as the informer in a manner optimist Pelta two days before the probably determining day for his career of official. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would begin working hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot;If the current vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of the soccer of the Czech Republic to l&quot; general assembly of Thursday that would not please big number of people, it adorned. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises nevertheless that if it would be elected one will begin working hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It wants systemic changes and return the members of the executive Committee are responsible of the different domains of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It promised equally to regulate the matter Bohémians, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to bring to soccer more of money and to continue the work started with the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President I want to take care of the soccer in his entire one&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;International contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA through national representation, professional soccer and of a performance soccer for the youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I do not say that I will do all that only&quot; said Rajchl in a discussion for CTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a player of team and wants to distribute the competences within the executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a determined domain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will distribute difficult missions for that soccer face a big step forward&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;A lot of people will not be happy for it will be a matter to begin working hard rather than to criticize the others&quot; it added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It did state, says one, that it would not represent himself as candidate because of a critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;Has matter of me, one knows that I work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need knowledge if that is worth the blow and if I will have people behind me that will put me without stops the sticks in the wheels and will emit doubts on each of the my actions&quot;, explaining why it hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;A lot of people anyway said me that I must not renounce for they would renounce also&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;Cest a confidence that I cannot betray&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Which the motivates, says one, is also to continue the begun work with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Since these two last years there was a big work of fact and I do not want to drop it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that were launched that will have consequences in some years and I would not like that someone stops them. &apos;, it declared with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the position within the Union does not return as her was before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe a systematic work and it is a thing that Mirek Pelta does not know to do&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind are located him of the people that would do the soccer of such manner that it would be only for those that were chosen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;One can reproach me a number of things but surely no supporter quelq&apos;un&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I strive to be objective&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to do the soccer for all buses everyone will be some happy not only those that were chosen </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms again that it would be only a President for Czech. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are some that say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum for the Moravie&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is the time to envision that the second division is divided in two parties the a Czech and the other morave of which the conquerors would meet again in first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;There would be not position as currently with only three teams moraves in the division for the problem is currently to find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Divided into volumes Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered into the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate its own luck to win. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel in permanence a support of the Czech Room that elected me his Vice -president and knows that with me there will be succés&quot;, declared Rajchl that envisions among its futures succés to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of contracts with the television and on the law on the games. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It says on the contrary that the Fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While it says about Pelta &quot;that it is disqualified for with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility&quot;, it thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate that has of what to offer to soccer. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can question to Plzen that it did this year a superb work&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If it was elected it would continue surely in what was started with Hasek and would not do notable change among the people in the Commissions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;It would not want to ruin itself its succés&quot; said Rajchl that has evaluated its rivals. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The most beautiful swimming pools of Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> A jump in the blue one </seg>
<seg id="649"> Of Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Pataugeoires in view of ovni, magnificent swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or does a long walk- can leave to rest its tired legs in baths of gaseous water. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows in which pool of swimming one can experience the more of well-being. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder went in research trip during the 18 last months, there is an object that should not lack in its luggage: his bath shirt. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Extensive on his back in water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and saim in opposition to the marbles Putten that awaited it on the other side swimming pool and did not lack to admire the New meticulously restored Art of these converted swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she noted in his notebook without delay all the worthy details of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 swimming pools were probed of this manner by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in his already published book: &quot;Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath&quot;. The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historic palaces of bath in the black forest, &quot;buildings of concrete Hardcore&quot; in the Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> She drove its &quot;travel to the baths more exceptional of central Europe&quot; in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she respectively visited places in Italy, France, Czech, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The German one of 46 years is a true fervent one culture of the bath. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Meder, explains that she does not have a lot of interests for the sport but ell feels attracted to the totally different water of a manner. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It is irritating that the supporters of the swimming must satisfy themselves to contemplate blue tiles and to suit itself pong of the Bleach while the joggers breathe enchanting perfume of the forests of spruce or can listen gazouillement of joyous birds of the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I wondered a day why the swimming pools have in fact to always be so ugly&quot; said the Viennese one. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I began therefore a collection of beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of water reinforces doubly the architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> One dived in a swimming pool and the volatile oils of sauna - well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the direction are awakened, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the master-builders would have given themselves a little more penalty, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor one has a water surface in the swimming rooms.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;She is on one hand transparent, but reflects of another side nevertheless the beauty of the building completely.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All the surfaces present themselves optiquement of a manner doubles: high arches, multicolored tiles, springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The volume of picture of small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; does a worthy report of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of historic well-being - it gives certainly envies to do a jump in the blue one. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Next to the splendid baths of well-being as the bath Széchenyi 100 years old to Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in miskolc-tapolca) as well as a thermal bath bath of which the pools are filled with containing water of the ammonia and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being located in a building in bottle form. </seg>
<seg id="670"> On the other hand, the heated swimming pools in the open of Switzerland and of Austria offers spectacular views. While of a roof of the bath of Zürich one has the very city to its eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an exterior swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish baths is provided with a window from which one can observe the organization on the skiing track. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Maybe the conception of swimming pool more extraordinary awaits the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> In the winter, vapor rises of the three open plateaus, while in background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the black forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> The odor of the Bleach does not emanate any all the swimming pools of the collection Meder. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur odor, árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong odor of oil, that it is difficult to believe, to find itself in a spa health. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The odor originates therapeutic alkaline waters containing of hydrogenates it carbon that is almost black and his silt sticks you to the skin as soon as you leave yourself to slip in the swimming pool - an experience of special spa. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During his quest of the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also underwent disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free exterior swimming pool and in the open Czechoslovakia, she was located in front of a barricaded land. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath conceived by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 meanwhile was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> While peeking by the window of the building art New in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of the bad grasses between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> She observed an opposite effect in a charm swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building already survived three phases; one can discover not only elements neos Roman that go out since his conception in 1844 but again a moorish room in trains Alhambra that was added him in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since his modernization trainer of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the experte in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because she is native Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It already is a beautiful yield that of melt train so different constructions in a so tremendous unity&quot;, says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace, the dived in the thermal swimming pool is apparently only a question minor. </seg>

<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be today particularly under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank must eliminate all the placements of his wallet, for which money was invested on the food speculations&quot; declared Bode. </seg>

<seg id="721"> 21st house to Coming </seg>
<seg id="722"> The House that moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> Of Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architecture history with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian house for the world-wide expositions of Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum to Coming, remained empty then fell in ruin. </seg>
<seg id="725"> At present it is again open and holds place of house of exposition. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If one oneself enthusiasm for an architecture according to modern war, for its clear forms, its sheds in glass, its lively and audacious paces its new materials of construction that are typical of the belief towards the technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exposition of Brussels in 1958 some is a voucher and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The House of Schwanzer reçut formerly the &quot;Grand Prix of Architecture&quot; for his construction in steel and in glass, light and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered until our days as an important step in the contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> It returned the architects if famous, that it also constructed the House for the universal following Austrian exposition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary house to four cylinders of BMW and his adjacent construction in bowl form to Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His house project as temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exposition in the Swiss Garden to the train station of the south of Coming, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened - </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building or physically or technically was not adapted for a museum - any walls to hang the art works, therefore not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless it also a long time was used, jusqu&quot; to what the contemporary art receipt a new structure to Coming. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and is itself more and more deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> At present the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the House, it carries now the name of &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will be in the future used as museum for the contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening the museum Gazebo opened, to which one the house belongs, the first exposition - a luck blow to any view point. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new departure was accomplished by Agnès husslein-arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Gazebo. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-arco, promoted an art historian to an among others considerable career in his youth of artistic skater, afterward with Sotheby&apos;s, to the museum Guggenheim and as founding director of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she took particularly to well the works of transformation with the politicians and protection of the monuments, she obtained from the public funds and of private sponsoring and in Established the exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Excepted the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of which foundation carries the same name there were exposed, a coffee and a bookstore itself there are located, and an office there must be constructed. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because it had transformed and widened with sensitiveness the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because it had studied at the technical University of Comes and that for him the house was &quot;an extremely important place&quot; place where it had seen &quot;practically every weekend&quot; the expositions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> It knew the origin project, and it knew the problems of the structure, that perdit in generosity and lightness after his movement to Coming and of by his usage change. </seg>
<seg id="744"> At the time of the current transformations, there were big problems: l&quot; structure was &quot;a gulf in energy&quot;, says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of windows of the facades in glass were changed, insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put and the roof replaced by a glass of special security. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The poutrelles of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the surfaces fill with asbestos were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements made room to the new exploitation, a panel of sifted light between the house and the road assures the lighting, a bridge drives to the entry - this is almost a new construction, but always the light House Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a complexion protection against brown red color rust. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the movie room is even exactly the same as which she was formerly. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all that under close surveillance of competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often materials that are good and not very dear had to be found, and that plaisent also to the office of the protection monuments&quot;, says Krischanitz and it attracts the attention on a crude ground in basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, l&quot; structure remained supple and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> That would have been difficult with the House, &quot;that originated Brussels&quot;, said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of “Drop-in-the-City&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such a architecture is located &quot;always to the bad place&quot; and wants despite all &quot;to awaken the good conscience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not located to the bad place, for if it is a matter of a blow of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands up exactly the &quot;neighborhood of the central train station&quot; all newly foreseen one, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another blow of luck maybe will produce itself: the House of the 21st century benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, for the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden. </seg>

<seg id="819"> After the announcement of the investment of Buffett the actions IBM increased of a percent to the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue&quot;, such as names itself also IBM, has a stock market value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and reckons with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious businesses of technology to the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> With Microsoft, says Buffett, it wants not there to participate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is tangible </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;cell of Zwickauer&quot; the Turkish media doubt the state of German right. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper speaks even of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot;, that would reemerge at present. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The Turkish assassinations of eight nationals and of a small Greek business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context. </seg>
<seg id="827"> After this new one, Turkey as well as the Turkish German population reacts with fear and worry. </seg>
<seg id="828"> For for a lot of German Turks the ghost that one believed dead since a long time remade his apparition: since the inflammatory attempts of Mölln in November 1992 and to Solingen in May 1993, it did not have comparable violence anymore with this right extremist context against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> What there is in Germany a xenophobia, it some nevertheless was never question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right extremist network that was detected reveals nevertheless proportions of which the dimension is far from being predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Is this a return to the bloody ideology&quot;, &quot;Such was the title of the publication on internet of the Newspaper Turk&quot; Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; underlines on the other hand that the one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries about the Fact that German authorities could be implied in the quagmire of extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is in a reasoned way that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg. </seg>
<seg id="834"> It is only two weeks beforehand that the Turkish community of Berlin and the political Germans and Turkish had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of Turkish German recruitment. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with cheerful colors that living together had been presented, symbolizing a success history. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The reports of certain Turkish media do the effect of one slaps: &quot;The gift of the Germany for the fiftieth birthday&quot; such is the title of an item in the Turkish plateforme- &quot;Haber X&quot;, that refers itself to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the German publication of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not deprive itself to draw from it conditions univoques. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;That begins reeking of&quot;, Such is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It there underlines that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have brought by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The action of the police was perceived manner very criticizes on the Turkish German forums and these afterward had debated success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it did not already come a lot earlier to the spirit of German authorities to do the research in certain suspicious environments of extreme right, astonish themselves the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More of one shows itself ready at least to average indeed drastic rhetoric: &quot;If the matter continues to be rushed, it will remain at the migrant ones anything else only the autodéfense and the armament&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;That will be well the car better defense&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;Internal peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and relevance of the punishment of the body of the network&quot;, writes &quot;Selen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Which that means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attempts of Mölln and Solingen in the years 90 well explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen deeply is anchored in the German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> For no other event showed more clearly to the living Turks here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what the mistrust and the distance by violence acts could unstop. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attempts nevertheless sharpened the feeling of the we in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the errors of the passed </seg>
<seg id="850"> Formerly this is especially the failure of the political German one after the attempts of which it Turkish in a hurry is itself complaint: Helmut Kohl refused to return visits to the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire of Solingen it sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish Head of state, did itself to represent to the funeral to Cologne by his minister of the foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted to the era in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the fiscal amount of its loads. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current report of the Turkish media shows once more how much the mistrust of a lot of German Turks is deep towards l&quot; state of local right since this date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Besides the efforts of an ampler explanation and reappraisal of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank to scandal of the lake of Zürich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The Bank more adventurous of Europe is not located in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS did almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and skates meanwhile of a crisis to the other. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is a German who must direct now. </seg>
<seg id="859"> This is not certainly what Axel Weber s&quot; was imagined. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure of the head of the Bundesbank; one had knowledge in July, that it would occupy in 2013 an almost so spectacular post: President of the Board of directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and career lucrative. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber publicly gladdened itself, greeted; the Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his recently obtained solidity and did to pass nice observations on the futures colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS succeeded the Turnaround&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I rejoice at the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And nevertheless, as early as the months of September it was clear that all was going to change. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A merchant of titles of UBS to London had diverted all the systems of security of the Bank and had singed about 1.7 billion Euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The boss of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> President of the board of directors of the UBS is considered since as suffering - and all ask: When is Axel Weber returning at last? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We already learned that Weber can be counseled bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as communicated it the bank Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber that becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not banker, a lot more professor d&quot; economy and President of the bank, and it certainly would have needed an adaptation period. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At one go it assumes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, that has just proved again once more that she has since a long time deserved the title of &quot;the biggest bank to scandal of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="873"> In fact, the UBS is on one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest administrator of active ones of the world, and other, she skates since years of a scandal to the other. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> That began during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Up to 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The picture of the Swiss administrator of active, silent and solid, but so crafty one, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted equally to become, in the domain of the bank investment, a very big bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Therefore the UBS managed on one hand in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more of originating money of an easy clientele than any other bank to the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> That made impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and late professor of bank during of long years to Zurich relate: &quot;I always took the UBS as model of good bank in front of my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From the perspective current, one wonders: how I all simply could have been mistaken me to this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It deeply cheated himself. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round to the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli withdrew itself in a surprising way, which was considered previously as a high intellectual as well as an inspired banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later one sensed for which reasons it had left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had singed with documents sub-prime and has of the to do a cross on billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support that, the UBS announced an increase of capital of an amount of 13 frank billion and did a cross over. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For that she effectively found investors, but that, little time before, would have gathered the eyebrows: a state Asian not originating transparent bottom of Singapore and a bottom of Arabic state, that was passed under silence, to the point that one even never learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> That n&quot; was nevertheless that the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 that worsened itself. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to announce again losses putting a figure themselves to billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, that was again in 2006 the second board of directors the more better paid of Switzerland, withdrew itself. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS was located, considering its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and dut to be saved by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank repurchased to the UBS of the tens of billion titles problematic, the Swiss Confederacy gave six frank billion for convertible obligations in actions, for which ones she could become joint owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The very Switzerland was shaken - for she noted to which not at all that can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter so big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> At last, the total of the report of the UBS 2007 s&quot; student to more than five time economical performances of Switzerland (to see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We were not able to save the UBS once more&quot;, says the bank researcher, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first catastrophe it is followed some himself by the second one. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already some months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a fiscal disagreement with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, that had cheated the tax office maybe with the assistance of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she accepted a payment of 780 millions of dollars - in reimbursement of unjustified profits originating of these operations with a fine increased. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus the UBS has more or less published than she had helped the fiscal fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that always was his capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal the Swiss bank secret not was anymore the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed some himself by the collection of the boss of the board of directors and president of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And exodus of the money of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus the bank had lost in some months his credibility in the two principal sectors of matter: the bank investment because of bad speculations and the management of active ones because of the assistance to the fiscal fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat a return to the calm, and as one thought it, that the UBS itself goes out some, it followed some himself by this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single merchant of title singes 1.7 billion Euros, before the bank does not notice itself that something did not turn round. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And one publishes: with the management of the risks in investment bank that does not seem not yet to work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli, one was able to note that the mastery of the risks to too not very changed&quot;, says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of the finances to the bank Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also the financial director of a big German bank in is sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is that she does not have the mastery of the risks in hand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> Nevertheless it was a matter exactly of the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had since a long time take their function, the one to become custodian of the big fortune of the world: no too big risks, but the security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the unshakeable symbol of a reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The central one UBS to Zurich goes again peer with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - she is only a little bigger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the position is classical. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has his seat to the central train station of Zurich, that drives directly central train station to the lake of Zurich, that surrounded itself by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings are here prestigious, the store rents figure among the more students of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The jewellers as Tiffany&apos;s, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions just as those of the candy store Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Since centuries of the Swiss bankers lived here: national bank while going through the palace of the Swiss Credit even to private banks élitistes as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> One arrives in the lobby of entry of the UBS by a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> To the interior, the walls are clothed marble, in front of are located thick chairs of leather, and next to the logo of the bank, a big label for &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer research here: the security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or the remote other of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds. </seg>
<seg id="923"> It would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all the Swiss bankers it does the matters also with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS would have become well too big, finds-t&apos; it - especially in the bank investment, where the Anglo-saxons are themselves in addition shed. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Switzerland would not have more anything to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And when well even, they are themselves since a long time adapted to the morals of the Anglo-saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> That was in fact the bank of investment Anglo-saxon that changed the UBS, she did the high profits and next the debacle: no European financial establishment lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The catastrophe became apparent October 15 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country to the seven millions of inhabitants undertook the biggest operation of salvage in the history of their nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The crash of the UBS&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> With even to 68 frank billion about, is 45 billion Euros, the politicians accepted saving bankruptcy the big bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could that arrive? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially to the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two of the three big Swiss banks concluded together a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was created, which already was too big for the small Switzerland - and recorded continually a growth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What helped is that the two banks predecessors different of the UBS completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as not at all fort the management of active ones to Zurich and a poorer one, but of course already more strongly internationalisé. </seg>
<seg id="936"> All of a sudden, the international banks of investment favorably had access to a lot of monies, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the ascension of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Bosses of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team&quot;, says the bank researcher, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the big modest intellectual, that itself there agrees very well in model and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one, that traveled a way to the summit with the apprenticeship of the bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would have trusted jusqu&quot; to the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli probably would have committed to the end a decisive error: &quot;It thought that its models were the reality&quot;, says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="944"> A thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The personnel of the UBS clearly remembers meetings of the leaders to the course of which ones the boss of the group Wuffli always pronounced the same word of order: to depose Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the investment bank the most powerful one of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She ordered the &quot;League Tables&quot; classifications, that informed to this era the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all the UBS wanted climb all in top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Certain steps already succeeded him. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In matter of mottos and of transactions of movable values she played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> The business counselors, that in had the responsibility, underlined nevertheless a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in bank gibberish &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there would be a huge difference in comparison with the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS would have gaps at the level of the products of American mortgages. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, the UBS is itself launched in an adventure, that almost cost him life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Thirsty of growth, it is just as well the bank itself as a bottom of created management before she in the placements sub-prime American that invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> She transformed herself in a massive machine that packed and does to pass the based documents of value on the ready American hypothécaires - but that equally preserved risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when of other banks looked for since a long time descend. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Again in course of the summer 2007, while the market of the real estate American was in flames, the UBS bought there&quot;, says Geiger, the bank expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> More the euphoria is big more the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One to manage after the somewhere else, when to put an end to the attempts proved themselves more difficult than one thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts with UBS became éjectables and are so far shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> The one that directs the big bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, for that all the suggested models of business disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration to the good management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not want (again) to go also far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank vigorously must atrophy, as much as that is clear jusqu&quot; at present. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday the boss of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 years old italo-suisse only was supposed to be at transitional title when the bank separated itself with surprise of his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, it imposed: it durably must take the matters of the UBS, communicated Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to bring back the investment bank to the state of advancement of the environment of the years 1990. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But that will not suffice. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what does she want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> This are the questions qu&quot; Axel Weber certainly already put itself. </seg>
<seg id="976"> It says publicly so far only that it was going to look for with his woman an apartment to Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> The fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American stock market </seg>
<seg id="979"> The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend discouraged the American investors. </seg>
<seg id="980"> The government change to Athens and Rome remained without impact. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The industrial production curbed on the continent stifled the hopes of a stabilization of the crisis of the debt in his germ. </seg>

<seg id="994"> Europe will be not soon to be in a position to recover itself of a recession, there are also others sign coming weakness of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, did nothing but to confirm this prudence: &quot;Is not again clear if Europe would be rather strong to do something to put an end to the crisis&quot;, it at-il declared in an interview to CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Consequently, it was from the standpoint too early to invest in obligations coming from the states and European banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead of that, Warren Buffett threw a principle old of several decades to the winds and entered into the industry of the American technologies </seg>
<seg id="998"> His investment of more than ten billion dollars to IBM supported the course of the actions of this traditional group, and allowed him to note almost more than 1%, against the tendency of the commercial management. </seg>

<seg id="1013"> In a lot of places, rooks are considered as &quot;bird problem°&quot; But the experts assert that these very intelligent animals do not leave themselves more to hunt cities since a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Certain the magnets, certain other want to rid some of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city since centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply themselves because of the dirtiness and noise of the animals. </seg>

<seg id="1261"> You will learn to know these people in detail. In this fictional narrative of Peter Englund, this list of personages will be your GPS, a beacon during these some moments where, as the one of its men or women, you will have disrupted and hopeless in the mists of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is equally the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, that delivers the price Nobel of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It wrote here a book out of the ordinary that it describes, with exactness, as &quot;an anti-history work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; one does not find almost any ambassador or discussion on the strategies and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so a book on what it happened, it explains, that a &quot;describing book to what that could resemble&quot;. One there rediscovers the &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;Beauty and sorrow&quot; summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, of the two sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, while going through doctors, ambulance drivers and salesmen. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some one will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Of others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become crazy or will die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives shake here as the candles of a church: while certain extinguish themselves, one rekindles some again. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book of Peter Englund separates itself from the traditional books of history. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War summarizes itself only by the terrible war of the trenches on the western forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;Beauty and sorrow&quot; describes skillfully other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern forehead, the Mésopotamie and eastern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The present soldiers in this book are located under hives; the one pass Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tsé-tsé are an inflexible problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving as early as the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war invades the lives of these people such a natural catastrophe, such a hurricane Katrina that been able the cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When blows of canon resound to the far, and that you are a mother to the home, are you remaining or do you flee? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who will come in any case? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost no one can understand what it happened, or even the reasons of this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, &quot;the fact lack was filled out by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, theories conspirationnistes, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;Beauty and sorrow&quot; follows by the individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English wet nurse within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of floats it high German sea. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their histories principally are pulled memories, of letters and of other already published documents. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The versions of their lives can be terrifying or fascinating, but are done more preserve thanks to the accumulation of small moments and of isolated details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The most approach the deprivation and the capacity of itself go out some. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> While relating the German history of a schoolgirl, Peter Englund written: &quot;Substitute, everywhere substitute. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, bandages in paper, buttons drinks some.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> It follows on the replacement food in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> It describes of the &quot;meat done of rice cooks crushed in grease of sheep (and finished with a false bone of wood); made tobacco with roots dry and dried skin of potato; soles of shoes some drinks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> It asserts that &quot;837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the sausage production. One finds equally 511 coffees of substitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Certain histories approach the honor and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own drive towards the savagery and declares about the war: &quot;You feel that after all, it is this to what the men were destined, rather than to sit in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whisky to the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to claim that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is not any barbarian behind your starchy and studded shirt. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Inversely, a British soldier realizes that it risks strong to die, and that no one will notice it or will not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a public&quot; it writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> This is unfortunately rather comparable to &quot;a condemned man choked in secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Of other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and again types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict becomes more and more a history of economical competition&quot; written Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It seizes the arrival of what it calls &quot;a new type within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated and convinced mass ideologically, in well cut clothing, that executes his butcher shop while being sat behind a counter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> The people be a question of unexpected manner; one finds as much basic behaviors that of heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund talks about the soldiers that attempted to any price to catch a venereal disease with prostitutes in order to avoid the service to the forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;One finds the expression more grotesque in the commerce of due pus to the gonorrhée, that the soldiers buy and s&quot; spread out over the genital organs in the hope to finish to the hospital&quot;, it writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The done more despair themselves apply it on the eyes, which translates itself by a blindness to life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of the Swedish one by Peter Engrave, the prose of Peter Englund is supple but non-ostentatoire, perfectly adapted to his try humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In tens of short scenes, it seizes the manner in which the war has &quot;released of the exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The people begin wondering why their leaders do them a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The better works treating First World War are often indirect, as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (The big war and the modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or &quot;A the west nothing new&quot;, of Married Erich Notices, rather than complete. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The work of Peter Englund is a panthéon not very conventional. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most overwhelming one than I read in a work non-fictionnelle. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I will not reveal it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But this is as if it had arisen of his book, seized of your hands this page where figures the list of people and burnt with a match. </seg>

<seg id="1312"> The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen for the park Zuccotti would be do more empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation remained secret of all except of some high placed officers as well as of informed others as early as the beginning that they were going to proceed to an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The commissioner of Police Raymond W. Kelly was located to the heart of the operation, his presence underlining the risks and the challenges for the department of Police. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> There could be not repetitions d&quot; episodes the latter weeks, as the usage of gas pepper against of the showing, that went against the regulation of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the showing. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The aiming operation to clean the park Zuccotti of its showing ones was deployed after two weeks of planning and formation. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The policemen s&quot; were prepared while observing the sequence of the occupations in of other cities. </seg>

<seg id="1322"> &quot;The some policemen that I know and that were called did not know that they would go to the park Zuccotti&quot;, declared the person under anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones to knowledge that they themselves there would return are at the summit of the hierarchy of the department of Police.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The city knew to keep a lesson, from which the secret of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> October 14 last, policemen wanted to clean the park but did themselves to push back by hundreds of informed show of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation of Tuesday implied officers of various unities of Police, of which of the operational forces of the whole neighborhood - tens of officers got used to the particularly criminal neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly declared that a lot of people went and came in the park during the day, to the manner of migrant ones. An hour in the morning was therefore a schedule favorable. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It suited to proceed when the park counted the less than people&quot; it asserted. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Vehicles of the equipped services of urgency of spots and of high speakers mustered themselves on Pipe Underpants and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drives, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and recorded messages resounding high speakers seemed to intimidate the showing. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While the officers to the community matters penetrated in the equipped parks of their cutting wind clear blue, many showing ones simply mustered their matters and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No stretched one was touched before 1h45 declared the Police, which left the time to the taking care of to muster their matters. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Of other teams of policemen were noticed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests proved themselves necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Present journalists inside the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the Spokesperson of the boss of the department of Police, asserted that this measure had been taken only by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But of after numerous journalists, the Police would have prevented them from observe the intervention inside the park, roughly kept by the officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne declared that the trucks of present movie cameras of television on Church Street, alongside the side west of the park, were in a position to capture pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the Police moved itself towards the west crossing the thick fouillis of matters of the showing, including the luggage, the lawn in plastic and the leaf bags fill with clothing, teams of the department of purification followed, cleaning all that the occupying left behind them. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The some showing ones that refused to leave were led. The pictures were broadcasted on Internet little time after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The principal group of show took places close to the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some formed a barrier that the Police moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About ten people being located to the epicenter of the camp hung on together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> At last, two people linked to trees, declared Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The urgency services were called to cut the padlocks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrest took place in the park before 3h30 asserted Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to the Police, the cleaning operation finished about an hour and quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, close to 142 people were stopped in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The most for &quot;disrupts to the public order and rebellion&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, boss of the department of Police, is the officer the more noncom to s&quot; to be found on the places. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the boss of the department of the detectives, was equally present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although present, &quot;did not direct the operations&quot; declared Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of policemen waited alongside the side is park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were borne on Cortlandt Street, a house pâté to the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> One there saw the Police to widen the perimeter well beyond the park Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, the equipped most of shields, even would have been seen in the process of pushing of the people to move away them. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Close to 28 people were located of the side north. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> The one of the actions more lively of the night took place at the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Towards 5h00, to the south of Pine Street, a showing one jumped on collapses it of a car of Police. Of others were noticed in the process of bursting the tires of a truck of Police. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> To a moment, a plywood end arose in flying of the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At last, a policeman and a showing one were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of the school assistance sues the city for dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents hundreds of school assistance having lost their job the last months foresees to file Wednesday a process to the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. Impact is disproportionate on the schools welcoming disadvantaged pupils. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The pursuits probably are the ultimate weapon of the union, Counsel of the 37E District, to attempt to let the dismissals cancel. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred seventy-two school assistance, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the less paid goods of the city, lost their October 7 last job. The union leaders compared these dismissals to a political vengeance in order not to have left the city to attain a bottom for health care directed by the groups of workers, and that would have allowed closing the gap of in the spring last budget. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities adamantly denied this accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At the time of an audience of the town Council the last months, the chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott declared that the dismissals constituted a part of the closed budget in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Counsel retorted, mentioning that the dismissals of the school assistance n&quot; not in the least were specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The officers of the Counsel of the 37E District declared that they would fill a complaint opinion, warning the department of the education that it would be followed; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to announce officially the judicial pursuits to the supreme Court of State of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis Mr. Walcott and the department of l&quot; education of the city will constitute the party défenderesse. The pitying will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black color or of origin latino-américaines, as most of the school assistance that lost their job. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the lawful department of the city, declared that the municipality again was not able to see the reasons of the process and do not can therefore to do commentaries on allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a preliminary sketch of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the neighborhoods the done more discriminate against city to support his complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the more of assistance because of an under uniform financing. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While one does not count any dismissal on Staten Island, and some a scarcely in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistance lost their job in the 23E District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8E and 9E Districts of the neighborhoods south of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the school loss of five assistance on eight employees to the public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the pupils live in poverty, the pursuits assert that &quot;This is not a neighborhood of easy parents that can bring funds to fill the budget lack.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of l&quot; public school 36 was reduced of 3.26% this year. Funds were equally lost when the city changed his calculation of the additional financing for every inscription d&quot; disadvantaged student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union asserts equally that the high school directors could be induced in error by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo employed the term &quot;passing&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;passing&quot; describes more generally the action to move a teaching one of a school towards a group of available workers of which the salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the complaint project, &quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed&quot;, and &quot;not only for passing cause&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Finished mission: the Congress finds an agreement on the question of the Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats found an agreement to the Capitole on the question of the uprising in Lybie. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It will have been necessary a successful uprising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long date Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American implication. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The committee of foreign relations of the Senate will have to take a decision Tuesday next, supported by the President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution consist in to honor the courage of the Libyan while they begin rebuilding their country&quot; declared John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;This is a support bipartisan to their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language is maybe inoffensive but the debate on the Libya was never simple so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators of the two parties entered in conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions aiming to approve or not the military role of the United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain presented an aiming resolution to authorize the limited job of force American military in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law project was overcome by a wide margin bipartisane and was never the object of a vote to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day of the failure of the project of law, the Room of the representatives equally rejected an aiming measure to reduce the financing of the American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The American mission is therefore remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the sufficiently annoyed Congress to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough for him to cut the grass under the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell under the rebel ones in August and Kadhafi was killed October 20 last one. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission of NATO officially finished October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can at present to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee of foreign relations &quot;congratulates the Libyan people for his courage and his extraordinary determinations regarding liberty&quot; and &quot;congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the engaged coalitions in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and fantastic professionalisms.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution asserts equally &quot;the national interest of the United States to succeed in an irreversible and successful transition towards the democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Will the new measure win the whole support of the Commission of the foreign affairs of the Senate or will she divide the legislators as in last June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The senator and president of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed itself to the last version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar again had not read the very last version again project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Within the Capitole, the Room must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a stable budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bobsled Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote to the Room or to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Of other legislators do not have so far successful to let their amendments approve but this is not without having tried. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to the Congress, on a wide fan of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurrent - the same project of proposed law at once to the Room and to the Senate - and of others are light variations of a preceding one. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> One counts at least 15 versions to the Room only of the amendment for a stable budget, and another handful that &quot;would check the federal expenditures&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Certain of these projects of law are identical, but give to their supports - notably the new Republicans that wish to gild their CV - the luck to praise itself to be &quot;the author&quot; of a such measures. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The law on the check of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in last August asked the vote of the Room and Senate on the stable amendment of a budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a non constraining resolution supporting the such a amendment idea. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which these the members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to get up the limit of two mandates for the presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed an amendment multitude guaranteeing the right to an education of quality and to the health care, among others subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment forbidding the marriage between individuals of same sex constantly is proposed, just as the amendment forbidding the desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Certain legislators wish equally to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States there are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As eager as were the members to offer amendments, they are not as quick as by the passed. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> At the time of the 111E Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduces 66 at the time of the 110E. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The rhythm slows down in comparison with the beginning of the years 1990, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every other year, according to the figures furnish by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments had not a lot more success than they have some today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added - the 27E - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Slaughtered but done not beat&quot; asserts Gabrielle Giffords at the time of his first televised interview since the shooting </seg>

<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilot and Navies around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in suit tie put itself standing to its feet to acclaim it. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The military officers, men and women, are considered as heroes&quot;, declared David Saltzman, organizing of the collection of funds of the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A high present military noncom to the gala, to which one participated equally the admiral Mike Mullen, boss d&quot; staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of the troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They were presented as an orphan sort&quot;, wrote the high military noncom in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intention. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But this n&quot; was not respect. Just of pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate difficult relations that installed themselves between the military officers and an American fascinated public but often distant. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Praises are lavished to the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, declare some military officers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public be a question of what&apos;s more more as if it was grieved for the men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We not at all are victims&quot; declared the general corporal Sean B. MacFarland, that directed the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for the Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it would seem that the only manner to support us is to confine us in the role of unlucky spirits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> It is a matter of a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, that do not wish to appear not recognizing or in disagreement with the public that they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They realize equally that the anger of the returning troops of the war of the Vietnam was well worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most of the conversations on pity take place in any confidentiality among the veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of its two sons of the fight with the Navies, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Certain would look at them with respect for they were confronted to rebel and traveled towards distant regions. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Of others would wonder if &quot;a veteran in anger and violent hides itself under the surface&quot; declared Cancian, that fought in Iraq and returned to work to the Government to Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When it looked for a job, it declared, it felt that some people that did him to pass discussions asked in a subtle way if it would be able to hold the blow under the exacting anxiety of a job to Washington immediately after his return of the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you approach the subject of the service, you confronted to negative impressions&quot;, recalls the colonel Cancian when it speaks with its sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The difficulties of the military officers arise, in left, from the American indifference towards the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The victories rarely are congratulated by a country also not very familiar with the army and that sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As nation, we no longer promote the heroism of the same manner than for the Second World War&quot; declares the retired general lieutenant David Barno, that directed the troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead of that, the congratulations of the politicians and people widely concentrate on the depth of the sufferings of a military officer. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized for the number of periods of endured services, the number of lost friends or the range of the injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army facing the growing pressure to hold sway against the rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, an audience capital will decide if 28 men and women will go in process against the army for a concerning supposed inaction of rapes. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If need be, hundreds of prepared complaints the next one. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier of 1ERE classifies Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant of 11 weeks the night where she asserts to have been violated by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> C &quot;was in October 2008. She returned to his barracks to Miramar Air Station, to the north of San Diego, after dining with a friend, when she met a colleague transporting a beer pack. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> It asked him if it could rejoin it in his room to drink a glass. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;C&quot; was an alarm signal&quot; declares Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texan one put aside his worry. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, it is 19 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is Texas&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I will have had to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Some minutes after entering into the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught it the back way, thrown on the ground and violated, she claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 military, certain others again in service and of others no, will await with anxiety the decision of justice at the time of a historic process that will unfold itself to Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a carried process against the former secretary to the defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The latter are accused of not to have stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, going thus in opposition to the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Classified in February by Susan Burke, an avocate of Washington, the process implied at the start 17 pitying. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming one to have been violated or abused sexually by colleagues soldiers. They claim equally that the army did not investigate, followed or furnished adapted justice after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke declares taking it out on the trimmed ones with braid military officers, for the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;That are the individuals in position d&quot; to eradicate the reprisals culture? The leaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> The avocate declares equally that since the months of February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, of which the most could be part of future judicial pursuits. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of mustering all the pitying in this matter - putting thus all its eggs in the same basket - she will file several processes, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of the defense, for the Department of the Defense, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a proposal to reject the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defense, and essentially the Fact that the army cannot be followed by soldiers in service or not for caused injuries in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a decision of 1950 of the supreme Court, person known as the Doctrine Feres, the federal Government is not responsible injuries suffered by the personnel in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged evil is inherent to the military service of the pitying&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The department of the Defense refused to do any commentary. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The things changed since the years 50. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While the women do not have not yet, officially, the right to go in battle, this distinction is registered only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only masculine. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a more and more important role, notably to come into contact with the local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two third in fight position. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernize itself declares Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone to take this fight: three other processes are in runs what&apos;s more of his. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> To l&quot; school of right of Yale, the center of lawful services of the prepared veterans a matter against the four principal military academies to supposedly have to encourage a misogynous mood. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the foundation to non lucrative goal Vietnam Veterans of America prepared a process against the army, while concentrating on the diagnosis of &quot;disrupt personality&quot; attributed to the victims of rapes in order to give them vacation - a comparatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women&apos;s Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a process in December to the Administration of the Veterans, while accusing them discriminatory practices in the manner to treat the ask advantages for the people declaring having been victims of a sexual aggression in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine independent projects of law of one another were presented to the Congress by a mixture bipartisan of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3.158 sexual aggressions were recorded according to the center of intervention and of prevention of the sexual aggressions (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) department of the defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions is under esteem. In fact, according to the own estimation of the Pentagon, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 arisen incidents that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The appeared report in March studies equally the percentage of judicial pursuits: in 2010, 20% of the recorded cases in the army were the object of a process - the half of the percentage of the civil judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The complaining about the matter of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first ones of a series of traumatisms. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the matter of Lyman, she informs the military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she says, one asked him to relate 11 times in details his rape to different policemen, doctors and ordering. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She underwent a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of his aggressor - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sat in front of a judge, to a process to the course of which one questions it on its sexual relations with his boyfriend earlier the day of his aggression. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people testified as morality witnesses for the author of the crime, that ended up to be acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember day where the verdict was returned&quot; declares Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I believed that I was going to begin having contractions. I began screaming after the course.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I was placed in psychiatric unity, and when I took out, I remember to have said to my order&quot; This was not his process but mine&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was constrained to consult a military psychiatrist, that ended up to diagnose a disturbance of the personality, the rendering unfit to the service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receive any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The matter Lyman and pitying others will advance or no, this is a long history, declares John Turley, right professor to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, it points out, &quot;A my opinion, they should be able to advance&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this criticized doctrine since his introduction is located between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I always criticized the doctrine Feres. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is located of the decades behind for she does not have the same advantages and average of dissuasion put by the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;Luck heavily are against them... but it is important that they try&quot;, it adds. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things change only when the vouchers have the will to beat itself. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the process does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the avocate of the pitying, will muster its hundreds of pitying others for other processes. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to beat ourselves against the army on this question as long as there will be not reformation&quot; she asserts. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where jusqu&quot; to what we would die, the one or the other of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy being part of its online anti-immigration opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, that recognized to have been taken of a deadly madness in Norway in the month of leaving July 77 victims, was confronted to his first process. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik has acts alone, it was far being on the cyberspace: it had passed a big party of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some one of the nationalist millions of that support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish in to know more on these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy... You connect to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that it n&quot; was not so difficult that that to rediscover them&quot;, declares Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a published report recently by the group of reflection of DEMOS on the numerical populisme in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is crammed of personal so many information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers simply could use the advertising tool of the site to find the people that they look for with a scientific precision - the manner in which the mercaticiens do it since years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> L &quot;team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a millions of half members are fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She targeted them with announcements, but instead of to link up them to a new group one or produce, the announcements invited the users to reply to an investigation. The put questions concerned their education level, their attitudes facing the violence and their optimism as for their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> While coming into contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and its colleagues were able to question 10.000 supporters of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;This is a new manner to do the research&quot;, declares Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Certain results not at all are surprises: the online supporters of the right groups are rather men, young and against the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &quot;those that associate online and outstanding activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that remain behind their computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> L &quot;study of DEMOS is only an example on the manner in which Facebook became the new essential tool between the hands of the scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> The reflection groups, the researchers in medicine and the political scientists use the site to study all the subjects that touch the health questions as the social tendencies, thanks to the &quot;I LIKE&quot;, publications on the walls and updated statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users that add in average three contents a day, the &quot;supernova of the data&quot; generates an explosion regarding research, increasing the number of works of research of which the name of the site appears in the almost title 800% in comparison with the five last years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For certain researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the Fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you attempted to carry out investigations on the people on the part British national, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to return to the party, but they would never have authorized you to enter&quot;, declares Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoids all that - you have directly access to their information. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Of said others that the site could offer a means to identify and to treat the sanitary and problems social. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of the wisconsin-madison, and of its colleagues, the studying young ones that spoke on Facebook of their exploits in condition to inebriation had enormously more luck to be alcoholics than the discreet students to this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the counselors, could oversee the site and intervene to help eventually a student of which the statute would speak too often of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You cannot treat a problem if you do not diagnose it&quot;, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, the behavior and the development of the children to the research Institute for the situated children to Seattle, asserts the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify the children to risks, and that would not be in another recognized case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also attains constantly to the news of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> L &quot;team of the site that takes care of the data studied statistics concerning the position in love and the day of the holy Valentin, the participation rate to the elections of mi-mandat of 2010 and an index of national happiness (thanks to only available the news - the champions of numerical liberty have during a long time sustained that the site could render available his data treasure to other people to ends of Research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But the users of Facebook know that the site observes them, that that their plaisent or not - in exchange for to be able to play Scrabble with a friend that is located to thousands of kilometers, the site is authorized to attain your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But that does it pass itself when the users of Facebook are part of an investigation of which they did not even hear to speak? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While the researchers have of the record well defined as for the manner to collect the news otherwise that while going through the Internet, it is any online something else. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a big number of users already thought about the Fact that a researcher can study their profile&quot; declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist to the Laboratory of the Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it took while observing the walls Facebook of its students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As much as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the methodology question. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without going through Internet, it did not guarantee anything that the subject of a study is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and which you done in the reality are two totally different things&quot;, asserts Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> This is the reason why, despite his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notepad and a pen remain the better tools than one can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with the people,&quot; it declares. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, is in front of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot; : first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attempts that did 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described itself as a fighter &quot;resistance&quot; at the time of his first apparition to the process that unfolds itself to Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military order of the movement of Norwegian resistance and Templiers of Norway&quot;, it explains in front of a room of full audience of 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;In the matter of the competence of the court, I challenge it, for you hold your organization mandate supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue for it &quot;did not want to leave him the timeliness to use this process to express its opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, it refused to leave Breivik, that brought with him a speech on paper, speak with the parents of the victims at the end of the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The judge Nesheim equally asked the Police on duty Breivik in detention twelve weeks of more, forbade him to speak with the media for four weeks and warned it that authorities would oversee of very near all the visits and correspondences for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About thirty parents of survivors and of victims were present to the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope to look at Breivik in the eyes, of others to be sure that it would be placed behind the bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All participated in the audience with the intention of to see the end of the process. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I found it cold and inhuman&quot; declared a survivor of Utoya to the chain of Norwegian television NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;I n&quot; was not comfortable, but I personally a little advanced after seeing and heard the suspicious one.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Clothed of a dark suit and of a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during the whole process. It looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes while entering and going out of the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of &quot;resistance&quot;, the judge determined that it was not crazy. It equally declared that there is not any proof that it has acts with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The July 22 attempts seem therefore to be the work of an extremist one rather than of an entire group of radical ones, which some will console maybe certain. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that not reduced sorrow or the confusion feel by the very nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I will have preferred that it resembles a monster, but this is not the case&quot;, declared a parent of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;That would have been a lot easier one.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lesson of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, to the movies this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs October 5 last, certain ones compared to it Henry Ford - distinguishing itself by the technical genius and inventor of modern data processing. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But which the fans of Apple can find of more revealing one in a discussion of Steve Jobs rediscovered recently and that will be broadcasted this week in first party of a film on the principal markets, is at which not at all this creative spirit had understood the processes and flow of work of the products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was without any doubts a creator and a dreamer. It identified himself to a hippie one but was equally very meticulous and organized, as well as an ameliorative one of flowcharts - a man that believed that many business leaders suffered from a &quot;disease leaving them to think that an inspired idea does 90% of the work... [but] A considerable quantity of handicraft separates an inspired idea of a product of exception.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bobsled Cringely developed the televised series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;. This series redraws the birth of the computer, and it sits during more of an hour with Steve Jobs for a long one and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> To that era, that did about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It already worked hard on his new computer business NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small party of the discussion with Cringely is used in Nerds, it declares that the principal copies disappeared in the transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a video completes is rediscovered in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, lightly climbed back up, is the basis of the film of 68 minutes entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, that will be broadcasted to the movies Wednesday and next Thursdays. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone of known to hate discussions deepen, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiast to expose technological philosophies and its commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And unbelievably attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On four different points during the interview, the responses come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which ones Steve Jobs clearly weighs its thoughts, with the intention of to bring a precise response. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> One discovers equally moments where the perfectionnisme of Steve Jobs reappears, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to do it to accelerate and pass to questions or subjects of bigger importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before l&quot; era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, one finds an aspect strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what it considers voucher or of bad one with the other businesses and is part of his own vision on the future of data processing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is a thing to read the evaluations posthumes of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something crude and of inspire on the man who we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of the magnitude. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It has a vision on the manner in which the things can be and must be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> It explains them then the continuation placement in work. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here a summary quick one of seven sequences remarkable of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the manner in which it learned to direct a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During all these years, I always asked: &apos;Why done you the things? &quot;and the responses are constantly the same: &apos;Oh, simply because it is necessary to do them.&apos;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why, no one reflects in depth to the things in a business. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs follows while giving details on its efforts aiming to simplify the accounting with Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Perplexed as for the manner in which the costs were recorded - one begins often by a &quot;standard cost&quot; value at nose view, then tailored with a &quot;variation&quot; - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the timeliness to play a turn to the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs relates the anecdote of the &quot;Blue Can&quot; that it created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to pirate the telephone networks and to telephone free in long distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device was the object of numerous written to the previous one, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Can as an appropriation act is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> It describes the manner in which him and Wozniak have tested the can while using a public telephone, while passing a call then while being connected of a network AT&amp;T to another while bypassing as much as possible satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We envelopped the ball of different things a half a dozen of time and you yelled in the public telephone and that you arrived a minute later to the public telephone of side issue,&quot; explains Jobs while laughing. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and thanks to this Blue Can, we learned that we could to create ourselves something able to check billion dollars of infrastructures in the entire world. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We did not know big thing both of them, but we knew to invent a small thing able to check big things. It was an unbelievable lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have an existed day without that. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs follows while relating a wonderful turn that him and Wozniak perfected: it telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Can to the beautiful environment of the night while being done to pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak with the Pope. </seg>

<seg id="1661"> The one of the matters in question concerned a process filed by 26 States protesting the reformation of the ambitious health care voted by the Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for the campaigning conservative to the national ladder. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges suited to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is awaited in next March, and the result probably will be nature to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, that will be in full expansion the moment the decision of the court will be returned. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer that will be held in front of the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, will be probably Paul Clement, that served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The lawful office of Lenient, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozens of offices that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Corporation (Federalist Society), a group of long dedicated date to defend the conservative lawful principles. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Harsh warnings of the Pentagon on the reductions potentielles of the defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary to the Defense, Leon Panetta, did climb the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the budget imminent automatic compressions would undermine the national security. It released a reaction in financial chain of the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of the Afghanistan, while going through the gatherings of civil ones. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already digests 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but feared now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more of compressions is imminent if the Congress does not reach to an agreement on the expenditures. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry&quot;, declared Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, r-arizona, and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It declared that the failure of the Congress to succeed in a resultant budget agreement in that one calls confinement, would induce 23% of reductions as well as the freeze many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A reduction so important, applied thus without discernment, would return most of our vessels and of our projects of construction inexécutables - you cannot buy three quarters of a vessel or of a building - and carry gravely attained to the other efforts of modernization&quot;, writes Panetta to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would equally have constrained to separate ourselves of a number of our civil personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we almost certainly should send civil on vacation without salary regarding to attain the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would shake the faith of those that support our military officers and would damage seriously our preparation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The reductions eventually would touch the fighting troops, continues Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad directly is not touched by confinement, the war efforts negatively would be affected by the engrave disruptions in the basic budgets&quot;, warned Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The contracting personnel would be reduced, inducing delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contracts that support the war&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The personnel managing the salaries would be reduced, inducing delays of payment to the war suppliers, and the lawful and political support&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking details on potential impact of the automatic compressions on the Ministry of the Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a confinement on the department of the Defense would have would release a quick decline of the United States as undisputed world-wide boss of the military power&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We fiercely opposed to this drastic action&quot;, declared the senators in a common communiqué Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter of Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a consequence with which can live us, and this is not certainly the one that we should impose&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;Confinement is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and she should not have to produce itself&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> What the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the reduction Pentagon, remains to see. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta was more and more virulent on the subject of the possible compressions, even if it reached itself to the more top posts combining Pentagon of the years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White and knowing House than it was confronted to difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> To a press conference the past week, the secretary to the Defense painted a dark picture of what could arise - a military officer with a shell, but no kernel. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;This is a vessel without sailors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;This is a brigade without bullets&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;This is a hunt airplane, without enough pilot formed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a tiger in paper, a barracks army, of buildings and of bombs that have not enough formed soldiers able to accomplish the mission&quot;, declared Panetta at the time of its preliminary remarks to the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;This is a depressing force, poorly prepared and incapable to do facing potential opponents&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, she invites to l&apos;agression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciated specifically how new reductions could &quot;to generate important operational risks: response delay to the crises, conflicts and catastrophes; harsh limits to our capacity to deploy us and we to engage in the world; and risks unacceptable assumed in operations of future fight&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta declared that certain of the biggest projects of defense could pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and certain just to the first stadiums of the planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list included the Fighter F35 Joined Strike, a new foreseen bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new vessel of coastal fight and the new vehicle of land, that would replace the Humvee of the army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Put an end to the development and to the essays of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars of economies on 10 years, but its said supporters that this is an essential step of improvement and of response to the threats potentielles of China and of rival others. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to spot a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look on the recent headlines indicates to which not at all the deception and the lie are omnipresent in daily life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The republican candidate to the presidency Herman Cain is occupied to exchange allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing the other to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of Penn State were accused perjury to have prétendument cover with the reports according to which these a soccer trainer to the retirement sexually attacked boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a microphone open asserting to the American president Barack Obama that the Junior Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie destroyed careers and contorted countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The member of the Congress of New York and fame of the Internet Anthony Weiner, is passed for an idiot while emitting quickly denials indisputably by proofs irréfutables. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former candidate to the presidential John Edwards was accused violations of the financing of the countries linked to the extramarital cover of a liaison. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, none of the one that lived the history will never forget the media circus that the president Bill Clinton released while lying at the time of his second mandate on sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The cardsharping narratives to the tests of the school and university are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were cases where the teaching gave the responses of the tests to the students in order to be done well to see on their performance evaluations. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The mentors that should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cardsharping are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception do we meet? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On a given day, the studies show that you can hear of 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Indeed, a lot of these are pious lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that the foreigners lie themselves to three returns in the 10 first minutes of their encounter. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect or spot lies is an essential competence that each must obtain, at once for personal and reasons professional. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game of similar corporation to, let&apos;s say, riddles, where the objective is to shout: &quot;I had you&quot;, the detection of the deception is a serious branch of knowledge base on scientific data collected during the six last decades in of prestigious universities having taken a research in depth of such projects, notably in psychology and in physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the myths more old on the lie were demystified. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars look in you the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They stammer, redden or shake themselves not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Not in to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A detector of qualified lie can discover the truth while examining the structure of the declaration, the microphones expressions facial, the formation of the question and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I passed several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emerging of the knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of the deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include notably the hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or the management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars are skillful to well to read the others, while putting them comfortable, while managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others the perceive. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know of after the research that the extroverts lie more than the introverted ones, that the men to say more lies &quot;centered on them&quot; while the said women more of lies &quot;centered on the others&quot; - habitually to protect the feelings of someone - than the married people lie less often to their partners than the people non-brides (but that the lies that they relate tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We know as as if you perceived as a heathen one, the others will feel less guilty to lie you. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you say if someone lies? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This one calls &quot;to establish the data indicators&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> That helps to furnish a reference point to measure the later changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the posture of your subject, the laugh, the vocal quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You must know if someone stirs normally its feet in permanence in order not to launch unfair accusations when you see it to stir the feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then look for indices of verbal misleading behaviors and not verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices as red flags, not proofs of the deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The misleading people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember of their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean itself towards an exit, change in a manner significant posture or present a relief of &quot;post-interview&quot; - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a posture change when all the difficult questions are passed. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The questioning ones indicate often falsely that discussion is finished just try release the post-interview reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also, paid attention to the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson slipped while using the passed while claiming that his murdered woman was living, releasing a national research to rediscover it. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The misleading individuals can equally use a left behind language: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat completely a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The verbal informers the most common ones are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;wood language&quot; at the time of his response to a difficult question: &quot;Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> That returns the perceptive rather than factual response is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is not magic formula for the lie detection, but the development of the competences to recognize the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These competences will improve the luck of whoever to avoid the victimization by arnaqueurs in their professional and life personal. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The plan of controversial oil pipeline will be disconcerted after the threat of late approval of the United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Some days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a project of oil pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - giving rise to the anger of the unions while appeasing the environnementalistes - the corporation trying construct the said oil pipeline that she is ready to rediriger the project to put back it on the rails. </seg>

<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a true way towards the before&quot;, indicates The Terry, a republican of the Nebraska to Fox New. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new examination of the environment ordered by the Department of State probably would have pushed back any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials deny the implication of the political one in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written declaration last week, described the decision as being the decision of the Department of State, and expressed him his support. </seg>

<seg id="1837"> But the opposed legislators of the Nebraska to this plan do pressure that a law for force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinkable water and of irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The study of environmental impact in course of the Department of State found that the project would put only environmental negative limited impacts, but the industry of the energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered a distinct investigation of the process of examination, centered on two questions. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The one is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, that was a counselor of country of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent an interest conflict for the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is knowledge if a business that was hired to take the initial study was an inappropriate choice of by his relation to TransCanada. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> The Course validates &quot;the analogical cut&quot; in Mexico in 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The substitution of the signal analogical by the digital ones is one of the change more important than the world suffered the last years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has nonsuit constitutional controversies that the Senat and the Room of the Representatives formulated against the presidential decree that advances the said &quot;analogical cut&quot; of 2021 to 2015, for the eight necessary votes to invalidate it were not met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, herein the president of the Course, Juan Silva Meza, considered that the president Felipe Calderón did not surpass its granting when it emitted the decree that details the actions to follow to make real the transition to the earthly digital television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited in order not to to have attained the qualified majority of eight votes for that the Course pronounces itself on the constitutionalité or non-constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as not constitutional, because of the Fact that the regulation regarding radio and television is a granting reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in parking ticket of the principles of hierarchic subordination and of reserve of law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> To favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero same. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, so the Senate as the Room of the Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to protest the decree and while admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions foreseen by this one for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary meeting of the ministers has resolved to nonsuit also the complaint formulated by the Room of the Representatives, without discussing the project of which the minister Sánchez Cordero is so responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his intervention, the minister president said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the direction that the federal Executive cannot structure through general norms the measures for that the public administration itself there gets ready. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I do not consider not more than if it did it one would affect the autonomy of the regulating organ&quot;, and it recalled that the planning of the political public one in strategic domains as the sector of the telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, that has for constitutional mandate the direction of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitution of the signal analogical by signal digital is the one of the changes more important than the world suffered the last years and that translates itself in a better exploitation of the ghost radioélectrique, a better quality of the signal and more of chains. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postpone the change, has it supported, would be to postpone the profits of the digitalization that implies a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, &quot;for that understands also economical, social, political questions and of national security&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These questions, has it underlined, &quot;demand the operation of all a system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economical direction of the State, includes a granting group that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> It recalled that a big number of country of everyone already finished the digital transition and they did it through of the Executive, in vexation on account of the fact that they had the technical strong specialized organs. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> One cannot conclude that the Executive, while emitting the protested decree, invaded of a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, for it assures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws emitted by the Legislature, it assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> One analyzes the possibility of a discount &quot;votes by vote&quot; to Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the data made obvious by PREP, the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbal processes. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of discount &quot;votes by vote&quot; is a reality in the matter of the electoral process this year to Michoacán, where according to the data made obvious by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbal processes. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this direction, the president of the General Counsel of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María of the Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that some days ago, the passed November 9, the electoral organ approved a series of guiding lines to harmonize the local norms to reforms it federal in electoral matter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> One will remember that Michoacán did not confirm or his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved reform them little before of that finishes the legal delay for that this electoral process can enter in force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication in the delays foreseen by the Law of the Newspaper Official of the State, with the argument of that it had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The same November 9, the Supreme Course of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Strength and qualified as &quot;invalidates and illegal&quot; the vote of the mandatory one state for reform them constitutional, for it does not have the right of the &quot;to punish or protest&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed on the possibility of the &quot;votes by vote&quot;, María of the Ángeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the guiding lines corresponding by the General Counsel of IEM it will be possible to realize partial and total discounts the votes by the local electoral organ. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Thus, partial discount of vote, of one or more electoral packages, it can himself that: the results of the verbal processes do not coincide; there is not verbal process of ballot and discount in the file of the ballot box is located with the president of this one; or there are errors or evident deteriorations of the verbal processes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Of more, total discount of the received votes in all the ballot boxes of the election will be able to be realized when there is an index on account of the fact that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of the respective election and the one that obtained the second place in the ballot is equals or underneath of a point of percentage; to condition of that at first of session exists a petition expresse of the representative of the Left and/or coalition that presented the second one signaled candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> Total discount of the ballot can realize itself also if at the end of common discount it results as the difference between the winning supposed candidate and the one of the second place is equals or inferior to a percentage point, to condition of that it exists the petition expresse of the representative of the political party of which the candidate took out second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packages that were Object of partial discount. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It is necessary to mention that that is the position of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first one and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbal processes. </seg>

<seg id="2012"> To all that it is necessary to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated éliminatoires of the European Cutting and the World-wide one of soccer. </seg>

<seg id="2040"> I passed to Costa Rica only once the vacation; this is a so beautiful country and I think that we there will be able to pass some days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> That we emotion therefore to carry our music over there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask you, for there is a devotion sort towards the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> Which is your message for your more fervent followers? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for to remain next to us during all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It were necessary 21 years for that we arrived to Costa Rica; thank you for to have awaited so and we grieved on account of the fact that so many time had to pass until this concert. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some said people already that his concert is the BIGGER show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> That adds a little pressure to your visit. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Certain of the BIGGER shows than we offered during the last 21 years took place in the two last weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We offered a two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that that put ourselves in form for this concert to Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> We are really very impatient of ourselves there to produce. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We like this country, we like to go surfing and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the better countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to go surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend that lives to Tamarindo and the waves are unbelievable over there. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends always went to go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to quotation of Mexico, are big places to go surfing; it is as well as we learned it, through the gents that like surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In visionary turned it, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What did you plan for your presentation to Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As us are ourselves never products over there, we have no restriction in the matter of what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to do the BEST POSSIBLE show, with a big variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to offer to our fans a good and catalog various. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the catalog. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Does to what have itself that? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each magnet of the different songs, this is for that that it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the catalog that we did not interpret anymore since very a long time, that helps us to remain concentrated and we surprises for that recalls us the reasons for which ones liked us these songs and that we can have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That does that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think than it becomes also more interesting for the people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this turn, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> While looking at behind, is it difficult to believe all that you succeeded? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> In first place, I believe that none of us had imagined itself only we were going to form a big rock group, and the Fact that we did it for more than 20 years done than that seems a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to relate our blessings and the fact to be able to continue to do the music together we emotion a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We like ourselves and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to go to places of the world to which ones always wanted ourselves to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could not go better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What means for you does it to have been a basic element in the creation of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> That always was an honor for us to form left this group of big groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is not very common. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Of time in time, a group arises of a city, but this is a lot stranger when five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We trusted and this is an honor for us to form left the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We play again with certain of them of time in time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> The past year participated us in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were at the Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in their turn, therefore we are lucky to be again friends with all them and it is an honor for us to form left this sound of Seattle that has arises. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> This is as very strange as a group as the your maintains itself united and with the same members for so many time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) rejoined us 13 years ago, and only that is a lot more time that a lot of groups last normally. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In first place, I believe that we are all lucky one to be again in life and, in second place, we preoccupy all for the others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all intimate friends and grace has that there are musical boulevards that give liberty to each to test. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We have confidence in one another with the music of each and that could not go better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relation with the word fame was not easy; nevertheless, thanks to your success, you were able to do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew, that was easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We assure ourselves on account of the fact that we pass not too many times in turned for it is easy to fall in this game of the big multitudes and people that like your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If one does not forget that the people are there for the music, that help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect the music and what brought it, without putting itself in head the Fact that one is famous and a rock star which interests not really to none of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember of your other project, Mother Coils Good? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we wrote good songs and at first that was grandiose. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a group during almost three years and we did not publish a disc before death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were a lot of frustrations for the Fact that she lasted if little and the most important one is the Fact that we are again very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen a song or I see a photo I think about the unbelievable person that Andy was and how it did me to laugh, that always was a Pleasure to work, to laugh, to talk about the music, soccer and by far something else with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was a surprising human being and it lacks us. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The Tired national group Robertas will open the show to Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose it for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos with of different suggestions and that one was the group that we liked the more, therefore we are impatient to see what Tired Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Do for what change you always the words of Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This one is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It is he who the sings and I believe that it does it with the first words that it imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bass player, which are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are some so... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first ones of which I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Sweeps, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There is so many influences, that I could speak all the afternoon on the bass players that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How did Pearl succeed Jam has to maintain raising the grunge in vexation on account of the fact that this one no longer is fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I in thought, that reminds me the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the one that have arises at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that that is wonderful, for it is a music that is worth the penalty to listen and the groups as Mudhoney do now the better music than never. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, his music had a more obscure content and now this one became more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Does to what have itself this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting, for I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, as The End now Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if these can ring a not very positive ones. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened them and these are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that if you grow and there is a traumatism in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things begin influencing your art and your music and these songs, doubtless, represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I think as as one also can be happy and even as that one can do the obscure music. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide on the timeliness of the summoning beyond the debate on the honorary ones </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again debates it on the role of Collserola to Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Towards the environment of the years &apos;80, in the middle of the apogee of the already extinct Metropolitan corporate Body of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed notices of promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The pamphlet defined the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Of more, she contained also a comparison, some amount, with the Central Park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of a lot of people, superior limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the axis north south, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola as natural park is at the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference no longer was Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> That was the position until, in September, the city hall summoned a méga-compétition composed by 16 competitions for all the doors of access to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door puts back to the park idea, without any doubts. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> This is that, or well someone wants to put doors to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question apparait all alone: Collserola: park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, so in the matter of his organization as in the matter of the reflection on the city is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is almost a recurrent theme of which two members of this former class of elected officials speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And that is exactly one of the rare opinions on which ones coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, that itself there presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after approaching the coastal forehead &quot;it is necessary of&quot; to debate on &quot;the mountain forehead&quot; for the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the one of the pâtés of green houses was not taken to end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It is necessary to leave the basis that the extensiver park of Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among others things for his big accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex&quot;, gave the verdict the architect for which entitles it of &quot;carry Collserola&quot; contains a &quot;traps glossary&quot; : it is not necessary to think about these &quot;as the accesses to a park, but the demarcation of certain zones in which ones it is necessary to act&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the town-planning world, qualifies the suggestion as &quot;challenge intellectual&quot; with &quot;some perils&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Perils that divert themselves from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of the public space&quot; after the lived experience in the years &apos;80 and that had in the zone of the Forum &quot;his swan song&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the own demarcation of the borders on which ones one can construct. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;To limit something means to already establish the following step&quot;, that is to say, his passing. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;It is necessary to think about again town-planning instruments, of planning, for the current ones [in reference to the General Plan Subway (PGM)] can provoke authentic disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> While being held more to the question, Modol agrees that, while simplifying, the pouring region El Valles of Collserola &quot;can be heard as a park, the one of Barcelona, not&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that it already exists a work done by the Employers of Collserola that &quot;must not be lost&quot;, while thanking for the timeliness that the city hall offers to his corporate body to intervene in this project &quot;as early as the first moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Of more, it hears that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe one drives that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; if this profiles technical must direct the teams multidisciplinaires (&quot;all a success&quot;, he says) that one has of the to create: &quot;We, the architects, should be only an instrument&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona insinuates that the response to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, for bases of the competition it lacks a global vision of Collserola: &quot;One summoned 16 transverse competitions - he says - in the direction mountain sea, but there is not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the zone in his body&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This does, at least in this case, that it chose to participate in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of another manner, a project for that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with the one of the architect of the door neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, yes, the city hall should guarantee that the immediately superior band to the one of Ronda of Dalt should foresee, in any sound extension, an equipment zone that carries out a soft transition between the city and the green. </seg>

<seg id="2238"> For a press conference, Dionisio Perisies Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transportations, mentioned that before take-off of the aircraft, the pilot noted that the climate conditions were adequate to fly. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The elements that seem to indicate that unity had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees to 25 meters where unity lost the fuselage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> It informed also on account of the fact that unity was conceived for 19 people, therefore this one satisfied the necessary requirements to transport the personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Of more, it said that the investigations done in the zone of impacte do not retrieve the appearance of pieces to the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a research one retrieved that there is not pieces or components of the aircraft in another place, impact presented itself in a structural way. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter had been conceived for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements to transport them. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground presented a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last some months, she even can last a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> To his turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State worked in speed of cruiser and that happened on a rising soft ground. </seg>

<seg id="2248"> During the press conference, the tenured one of the SCT, Perisies Jácome, enumerated six important elements in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the normative aeronautics, the flight was realized according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and to the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Meteorological conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions to the take-off, and to the rate and has measures that the aircraft advanced towards the bordering zone between DF and the State of Mexico there was of the put to bed nebulosity to weak height. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected roads: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is probable qu&quot; because of the nebulosity conditions the crew looked for a zone of weaker height and more of visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impacte. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinated impacte and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impacte it did not there have or loss of the check or deterioration of the trajectory of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft in a reduced zone: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Available information so far allows supposing that the impacte took place on an upright and lateral trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The model of dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft allows supposing that the helicopter collided with itself the ground in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> One did not detect tracks of fire or of explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the place of the sinister one it does not always have any track in the remainders of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiples contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the land works one found pieces of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presented a slope that goes since seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which it possibly dislocated himself to alongside his trip. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information furnishes elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had multiple impactes with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After the meticulous research in an ampler zone than the encircled place, around the accident, one did not find pieces disperse aircraft, which bears the presumption of that impact took place in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>

<seg id="2268"> Social assurance directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of the children and young; this is borne by specialists of the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of children and young, called protocol &apos;Genetic of the obesity of the children and adolescent&apos; that will allow having the associated markers to the surpoids. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a communiqué, the boss of the Unity of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20E Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one had formed a team multidisciplinaire of doctors, nurses, nutritionnistes and attend social. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of third cycle of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and Center of Investigation and of Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) Institute Polytechnique National (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> To the investigation one invites to participate the population having or non-right, to present itself to participating athletic unities of the IMSS to Valle of México, where carry out themselves the proofs to the minors all the Saturdays from 8:00 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> It underlined that the protocol began in Athletic Unity Cuauhtémoc (Estado of México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity unfolds itself in Athletic Unity of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of México Orients). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After attaining the objective combining 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Athletic Unity Independencia (to the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Athletic Unity Morelos (to the north of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> It explained that the objective of this investigation and the one e connaitre the components and the importance of the genetic one in the matter of the development of obesity and to identify with the children and Mexican young factors of risk to warn the appearance of the chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As one will celebrate November 14 the World-wide Day of the Diabeteses, it mentioned that the objective is the one to combine three thousand children and young between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to the nutrition. </seg>

<seg id="2278"> It detailed that the Saturdays one will apply to all the participants of the anthropometric mesurages (weight, cuts, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycérides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one tries identify the associated people to infantile obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López signaled that this investigation is the fruit of the preoccupation of the professionals of the health for the alarming one taken of weight in the case of the minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;The investigations of health of 1999 and 2006 signaled that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of the boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of the girls of the 47 percent; in the matter of the surpoids one observed also a dramatic increase&apos;, underlined the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> It indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the Fact that the population of the country is different of the others by his genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It informed that in average, the Mexican ones have a 65 percent of heredity indo-américaine, a 30 European percent and a five African percent and this condition reflects itself in the associated people to the diabeteses and surpoids. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> It explained that usually, the genetic one of obesity translates itself in the inability of bruler the excess of energy that one consumes (calories), that deposits itself under the grease form. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct profit for the participants this is the complete evaluation of the children, which allows detecting if they present a degree of surpoids or of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Ila said same that the presence of the pleats of dark color (acanthosis) on the neck and the forearm indicate the probability to suffer from metabolic deteriorations and even pré-diabètes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors put back it in writing to the parents, to which ones one explains each of the measures and changes in the life style that they must realize to warn the diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three principal components that cause surpoids, obesity and of other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, that is the daily physical activity lack, remain most of the day sit in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead of going on foot on short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another causes is the high calorie provision, that is to say the biggest consumption of sweetened drinks, moisturize carbon (tamales - meat pâté to the flour of enveloped corn in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a contained top of grease and proteins and the genetic analyzed one in this protocol. </seg>

<seg id="2291"> If the signal that the paved were resolved, it would be no longer necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrant every season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) UNAM, that assured that if the process of construction and discussion of the paved bitumineux is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During his lecture A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it announced that the laboratory of which it is responsible develops of the blacktop modified with polymères to produce a mixture having similar characteristics to the one of blacktops it, but with a mechanical resistance bigger, so to high as low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera considered that this type of blacktop modified could be used in places in which these the climate is extremely hot, as certain cities of the north of the country, to improve the yield, and consequently, the formation of the blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> It explained that blacktops it, the heavier party of the oil, is a body of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, that together give to the paved his characteristic behavior viscoélastique. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The behavior viscoélastique of blacktops it consists in the Fact that to high temperatures, closely of 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, to 120 degrees C his viscosity is very big and to 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while to very low temperatures, blacktops it becomes breaking, it added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> That means that in the streets the resistance of blacktops it is not uniform and modifies itself during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad of México in their majority were covered by a paved flexible one, composed from six put to bed materials, of which the three last ones imply blacktops it. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the put to bed more superficial is located the layer of blacktops, formed by of small bathed rocks in blacktops and compactées later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the small rocks that forms the layer, it signaled, is bathed year blacktops. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When the there past vehicles while generating efforts, this one allows that the forces propagate themselves very well in the paved. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If one had of blacktops it modified, these would propagate themselves better, agreed the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the layer of blacktops, he says, one puts a last layer called puts to bed rumble, done in fine rock, that is to say, sand that also is bathed in blacktops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, she must have more mechanical force than the layer of blacktops and furnish adherence in the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Having left it the paved that receives and distributes the efforts, the rumble layer demands as as this one has an adequate thickness and the material of which she is done must be cared for. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, specially humidity and the temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, specially water, he says, for these considerably affect the yield of the layer of blacktops. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground wets itself, water sheds itself inside the layer is it is difficult that this one sort, which soft all the put to bed of the paved and consequently cause of the blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that ruins itself is the film of rumble and only later is affected the layer of blacktops, but the damage does not have place immediately, but it is a process that must be cared for to the first signals with adequate programs of discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and consequently the thickness of every layer of the always paved must be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee his satisfaction, to avoid the formation frequents blackcurrant. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is again a lot to investiguer and work on blacktops it, for example, the emulsions bitumineuses, that in of other countries already exist on the market and allow repairing the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What lacked to the candidate of Valle to be the new miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analyze factors that did that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain the crown of miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives his title number 14 of princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to satisfy itself with the fact to find itself on the podium of the winning ones, carry the crown of money and the band that accredits it as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the obtained result last night to Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico brought up with the crown and the scepter, the department sum already 14 titles of Princess and Melina itself one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca that were located close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which ones Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Pink Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), White Leila (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today the big question that a lot of people puts itself is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What did it lack? Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite one that in every presentation showed that she had it all to be the new Miss Colombia, for she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Better Face Pretty of Fashion, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro that took themselves the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first considered factor key in the decision taken by the juror to designate it First Princess is the Fact that she did not convince with his response to the question &quot;? Which was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Here the response of the candidate of Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of itself culturaliser, definitively I believe that the book that marked my childhood is&quot; The small prince&quot;, this is a book rather deep. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At present I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, it is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called &quot;THE fervor of the blood&quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response did not please first of all because of the term &quot;itself culturaliser&quot; and deuxièmement concretely in order not to explain which manner every quoted book had marked it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she felt quiet and happy with the result &quot;the universe and wise, it happens what must happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for everyone, read please a little, &quot;The small prince&quot; is a big book&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Between the launched hypotheses there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being preferred it, applauded it and the candidate that received all the preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the better hand-crafted suit, and Queen Mother), &quot;that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and it is for that that she did not shine on the scene&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And one noted that in his first presentation in bath shirt to the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the day before coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even if to the two parades she had appeared sure of herself, one noted that she did not have the force and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como put some&quot; (As to the house), Canal RCN declared that the Fact that Melina had been designated princess &quot;confirms the Fact that the candidate that obtains most of the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Of more, Valle avoided the press to the end, and that was an error. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis it is that Valle did not succeed convincing the jury on his interest for the social initiatives, that is in fact the gasoline of the National Competition of Beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It is for that that two days before the election sworn it international Lucy Doughty declared that they looked for an engaged woman in the matter of the social necessities of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only beauty is not sufficient with a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look at beyond the physics and to center itself on his social sensitiveness, that before beginning the Competition already are implied in projects&quot;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> One speculates as as Valle sinned by its defects of his behind and the fibrosis that observed itself in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, for precisely the jury elected it as the candidate &apos;natural Beauty&apos; with the healthier body, good nutrition and physical work person in charge. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The assistant of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco reconnait that Melina did not have the better body, that it in there had better, &quot;but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, that in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points the last day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions that she had undergone. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;Surgeries are good, but Valle did not know to do them. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body was never his trump and she lost because of this aspect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this price, that the National Competition of Beauty puts back for the first time, after the parade in bath shirt has arises a cruel prediction that accomplished itself last night, one said that that was a small gift that Raymundo did to Melina for not to give him the taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, a position that gives him the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the competition international by designation of the National Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Nevertheless, she will pass in the history as one of the queens that in spite of his dazzling passage by Cartagena, did not obtain the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Was thus the work of the person of Cali that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste of Cali is passed to the history as the man that confirmed the death of&quot; Alfonso Cano&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The passed November 4 a dactyloscopiste of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the person that confirmed the identity of the supreme boss of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, while confronting its fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven dactyloscopistes that work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability &apos;of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada that works for 21 years in the domain of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At first of his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where a lot of times it had to pass more than five days in the forest to arrive to the place in which were located the corpses qu had to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 it did himself transferred to the capital of Valle and after having follows by the adequate courses, it specialized himself in dactyloscopie, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say the palms and the feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against aka Alfonso Cano one had warned to Eliazar to take with him of the clothes at least for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something of very big one awaited it. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday the night it left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> It knew that it had to identify two corpses and that one suspected that one of them was the one of the man that directed the OLDER guérrilla of the world, consequently one asked him to take itself the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when it arrived with the investigation team to the place of the corpse, it did not recognize it by his physical aspect, for this one was very different of the one that it had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It did not have any beard, it was dressed as a peasant of the zone, without glasses and a lot leaner one. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But the impressions do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the one of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye did not cheat it: it was a matter of&quot; Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> This same night, the native man of Puerto Tejada was the person in charge that confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was a matter of the supreme boss of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> To the research of the impression </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manual Santos did to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> A lot of people of connait not our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactyloscopie is an exact science, without error margin, that can be crucial in the crime resolution. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> From to identify the corpses, the supported dactyloscopistes the investigations for the offences as the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When are captured, a lot of delinquent present false cards of identity or do not have any documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take their fingerprints and the look for in the data basis. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told that in a flight case it had to remove a part of wall of a house, for in this place the thief had supported his hand to let a safe go out a lot of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult for they are not any adequate areas to draw from it a fingerprint, but in this case were able to obtain us the impression of the very hand and identify to the delinquent one that had participated in different flights&quot;, it remembers. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The impressions also can separate or confirm suspicious in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently one found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> By intermède of the investigation one determined that a parent can be suspicious of the crime and in fact an impression on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if that no guarantees not that it is the assassin, that places it on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste of the CTI explained that one extracts &quot;the fingerprints of the objects with of the reactive chemical one or physical&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, one uses a préleveur or a band to remove them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Posterior, the impressions are sent to Asif, the basis of data of the déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there is again a lot of Colombian without papers&quot;, indicated the expert of the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> It explained that all is not how one shows in the program of television CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As all that shines is not any now, all that one touches does not become forcement an impression. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> She nevertheless can be used, if one realizes the necessary confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; challenge the authorities to New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of show jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti for there to camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A big party of the people attained the order of discharge and moved itself to a park neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The integrating movement Occupies Wall Street challenged this Tuesday the authorities of New York while trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from which they were evacuated to the dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of show jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to attain thanks to a judicial order that allows the &apos;indignant&apos; to camp again in this place, while the somewhere else movement replied to the discharge while occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there were again stops. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will install ourselves in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through of sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations&quot;, says one of the spokespersons of the movement &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray detailed that the response of the &apos;indignant&apos; to the dictated discharge of their camp personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived until the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that forbade the forced discharge of the place and allowed the showing to remain in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Of more, the &apos;indignant&apos; occupied a new situated park to the confluence of the central Canals Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close of the entry to the tunnel Holland, that unites New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they succeeded occupying the place, but after the Police itself there moved and stopped some showing ones, even if Bray was not able to confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe on account of the fact that it saw some journalists to which ones one also had passed handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization assures that there is centennial of people that had installed themselves in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved himself in support sign to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them in front of the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - that is a pregnant one of private property - remains closed while awaiting the judicial celebration of an audience foreseen by this Tuesday during which one must analyze the legality of the discharge of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some showing moved ones even there carried and distributed to that hour of the copies of this judicial order and they delivered it even to the agents that oversaw the place, which caused &apos;certain small clashes&apos;, indicated Bray, that denounced certain official the Fact that hit showing them. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order forbids to the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply of the &apos;published laws after the beginning of the occupation or to forbid to the showing to attain again to the park with of the stretched or of other property that they used beforehand&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The mayor Bloomberg indicated in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the showing, to which ones it nevertheless warned on account of the fact that the local laws do not allow them to install itself with of the stretched and bags to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The municipal counselor defended personally the realized discharge to the dawn to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which one stopped 200 people and that was decided because of the Fact that the showing &apos;violated the law&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that it had given the order to evacuate the place because this one became &quot;a place in which them no one came to protest, but to violate the laws and in certain cases, to do harm to other people&quot;, for &quot;certain stores had received threats&quot; and the residents were afraid &quot;for their life quality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The discharge of this morning to the dawn was repugnant and shows that to the bottom Bloomberg is more been very interested in to defend the financial interests than those of the American workers&quot;, added the Spokesperson of the movement, that accused the mayor of &quot;not to respect expression liberty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The people in charge of &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot; indicated as as they do not think to organize of &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with the community organizations and the unions to commemorate the two months of protest, that began September 17. </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan renait after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The PIB raises a 1.5% thanks to the consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of decrease of the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the months of March the Japanese economy found itself paralyzed, convalescent again after the devastating earthquake that became nuclear crisis, the worse catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, in spite of the difficult world-wide context, seems to have lessened. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Crude Internal Product between July and September served to turn definitively the page: the PIB raised a 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% in made annual rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The one recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - supposes, what&apos;s more, the biggest rhythm of increase since the period of January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recuperation explains, partially, by the return of the acquisitions of equipment to restore the zones devastated by the earthquake and the posterior tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Of fact, the businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, by report downwards of the 0.9% of the expenditures of observed capital of January to March, the first decline after six months of not increase interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Nevertheless, the true one stimulate Japanese economy does not base itself exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or to rebuild - infrastructures, to use the lacks for croitre of zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan awakened especially thanks to the evolution of the consumption domesticates, that currently represents the 60% of the Japanese PIB. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable raised a 1%, pushed by the increase of the expenditures on vehicles, travel and recreation activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The scar of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo put back itself to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese change - became one of the &quot;values refuge&quot; elected by the investors that flee the crisis of the debt in Eurozone and the disturbances anticipations of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With one divides stronger, the products are dearer abroad, a serious back for a country of which the line of economical flottement is determined by the health of the big technological groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, did responsible of their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of E.U., the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;It is necessary to follow the risks that persist, as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the quick assessment of the yen&quot;, signaled yesterday the secretary of state for Economical Political, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And effectively, the perspectives not at all are encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The organization for Cooperation and Economical Development (OCDE) mentioned that the majority of the member nations presented in September of the clearer signals of economical slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The informer that anticipates the points of modulation of the world-wide economy put in relief that the principal ones be able are braked. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> For this one lowered four decimals until 100.4 points, in comparison with 100.8 in aout. </seg>

<seg id="2427"> Athens supplies again the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Said Papadimos that adjustments will be approved, but the conservative ones will not sign any written engagement </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the peripheral released risk premiums and the resettled uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues get tangled up in the labyrinth that drives to the go out of the big crisis of the European debt. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The sensation of that the &quot;consensus&quot; new Government of transition hellène rather is imposed by the requirements of Brussels that by a real conviction of the political forces begins being confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos signaled yesterday that there is not of alternate one for reform them structural and that the period of hundred days establishes in his designation will be can be runs to apply them, the leader on the part New conservative Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it was not going to support the new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated his requirement of new elections for foreseen date, the one Of February 19. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The principal task of this Government is the one to apply the decisions of the summit of October 26&quot;, declared Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will finish tomorrow with a confidence vote for the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to stimulate the job, reforms it disciplinary code of the officials and new measures against the fiscal escape will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Nevertheless, the message of Samaras no releases the doubts on his position: &quot;We were involved ourselves to help the transition Government, but we were not involved ourselves to anything of more&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The leader conservatif went a step further in his pulse that E.U. and IMF, the organisms that must unblock the 8,000 million that Athens necessitates with urgency, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of engagement of realization of adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, irritated again by the impacte provoked by the avenue all of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not unblock the assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the principal ones leave hellènes sign &quot;an engagement writes without ambigüités as early as possible&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2445"> We have &quot;attains a lot of objectives&quot; and &quot;we are done facing a lot of challenges&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Summit of the Microcrédit is envisioned not only as a debate for, but also as the plateforme has to leave of which ones it is necessary impulser &quot;two basic goals&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2454"> In this direction, she exposed that this would be an error of vinculer the cooperation with countries in the process of development to eras of economical prosperity, for this one is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that the microcrédits suppose &quot;a serious political and severe dedicated one to the eradication of poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of the developed nations must work under criteria of solidarity and not to leave that this one is the victim of the compressions. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the microcrédit is &quot;one of the principal lines of cooperation for the development&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The secretary of state for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; to give &quot;confidence&quot; to the people &quot;excluded to which ones all farms the door&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of Fastened it, wished the welcome to the people present in a city that &quot;opens its contaminated doors of the united spirit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the European president to the universal vote </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Union democrat (CDU), Monday November 14, to Leipzig, unfolded itself without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president on the part Christian democrat. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe initially was not foreseen to the program but imposed on the fall, notably to satisfy the campaigning that judge politics of the too lax government with respect to the Greeks today and maybe Italians tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposal on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted to the almost unanimity. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes to which had right, to the coming from their interventions, Angela Merkel then, some hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile minister of the finances, did not leave places to the doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The principal idea of the chancellor - and proposal - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less than Europe but of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe, this is peace but because &quot;nine millions of jobs depend directly of the Euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the chancellor, &quot;the time came from a breakthrough in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> That could translate itself by modifications to the treaty of allowing Lisbon to reinforce the check of the European Union on the political budget one countries of the Euro zone, but that could equally lead to the election of the president of the European Commission to the universal vote &quot;in order to give a face to Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Such is in any case the one of the suggestions of the proposal adopted by the congress of which the instigator clearly is Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Of course, it is not very probable that the Twenty-seven agree quickly on this revolution: the Great Britain there is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy it east equally. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the stake is put. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> All the same, the delegates rejected to one crushing majority the suggestion to balance the each country weight to the board of directors of the European central Bank according to the weight of every economy, which evidently came back to to reinforce the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Concerned to appease the climate inside his party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl But she not not did more try win his congress on the back of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in prompt difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the proposal on Europe consecrates a paragraph to the importance of &quot;German French friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel did not evoke France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Safe in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> While recalling that there are two centuries, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Of fact, this was the one of the more humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What does represent the fraud to the stops disease? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stops disease. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday November 15 to Bordeaux to visit a cash register of family benefits, and to pronounce a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - fight against the social frauds and the assistanat. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, that leaves a will to save money in a harshness context, but is not less warning of an axis of the presidential campaign to right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stops disease. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First in a goal of budget economies: the government envisions to impose on the employees of the deprived a fourth day of lack before the taken in charge of a work stop. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In clear, without agreement of specific business, an employee that falls sick would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that risks giving rise to anger, but that would allow retrieving 280 million Euros, according to The Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that would be accompanied of another measures, of more symbolic reach: to impose on the officials a day of non compensated lack in case of work stop (they do not have so far any delay of lack, against three days in the deprived). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these questions are in discussion, the majority restarts equally the thematic one of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses linked to the work stops. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The checks will be a lot more important ones and, what&apos;s more, if you took, you will reimburse&quot;, warned Xavier Bertrand to the microphone of RTL, Sunday November 13. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As for other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the frauds to the work stops. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This one does in fact the object since 2002 of a followed constant one and of political offensives, that most often bore fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Let&apos;s delay first on the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the national cash Register of disease insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were delivered in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute of research and of documentation in economy of health, the daily compensation represented in 2008 5% of the expenditures of health, with 11.3 billion Euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> On this sum, 46% concerned the vacations maternity and accidents of the work, and 54% concerned the stops disease, is 6.2 billion Euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And therefore 2.5% of the expenditures of health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French knew in average 14.5 days of stop of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that hides certain gaps: another investigates, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees questioned said not to have taken any day of stop disease. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time disease insurance, precise that in 2010, 37% of the stops disease were of an inferior length to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a months, 15% of a to three months and 11% beyond. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere to the work stops. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long conducted study in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence (for reasons of health or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% to Denmark, 15% to the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% to the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud to the stops disease represents very little facing the moonlighting. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As for the fraud, she attains only a weak extent. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 does that the checks are systematic on the stops disease of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, on 1.5 millions of checks, the CNAM noted that 13% of the 285 000 realized ones for short-lived stops were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, is 37 050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the stops of more than 45 days, systematically checked, one counted 11% of case &quot;misfit or unjustified&quot; on 1.2 million, is 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Altogether, therefore 169 000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot;, on several millions of employees having had a stop disease. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents well little face, for example, to the one of the moonlighting. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the representative UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the question in June, this one would represent 9 to 15 billion Euros of lack to win fiscal per year, is more than the total cost of the daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new program of adjustment to rectify his economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> It is what declared Monday November 14 the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, in front of the Parliament, adding that the cents days given to his union government would not suffice to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To follow the efforts of turnaround of the economy, we need the European support of our partners and of a new program of budget adjustment&quot;, declared the government leader, that pronounced his first public speech to the opening of the debate on the confidence vote to the Parliament Wednesday. </seg>

<seg id="2513"> Consequently, Mr. Papadémos foresaw that the public deficit of the country will be reduced &quot;to the surroundings of 9%&quot; PIB of here the end of the year, after being of 10.6% in 2010 and of 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right refuses new measures of austerity </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, brought Monday its support for the already approved measures to attempt go out of the crisis of the debt but warned that his party would not be involved itself on an additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures&quot;, it said at the time of a meeting with the representatives on his part, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> It was said agreed with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and debt, and of fight against the wastes but hostile to all political one that would prevent the economical return. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> To Olli Rehn, the European commissioner loaded economical and monetary matters that warned that the IMF and THE E.U. would not unblock the ready one of 8 necessary billion Euros without written guarantee of all the parties that they would support the foreseen measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word sufficed and that it would sign nothing under exterior pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and the attended suicide, says a committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in the denial of the death, according to the report of the Royal Corporation of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Regarding cares palliative, the committee claims that the governments, the health care institutions, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative cares, and that, beyond the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian corporation lives in the denial of the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of the Canadians accept in fact to speak with their doctor of the conditions in which ones they want to die and take disposals to this effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is the one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Corporation of Canada, to which one participated six experts linked to various domains, of which ethics, the right and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal Code in a manner to allow the attended suicide and euthanasia, when this choice imposes, with a competent judged patient to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Of entry of game, the experts quote a recent investigation of the Economist Intelligence Unites, that compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada itself there classified 10E, the study notes that &quot;the médicalisation of the death to Canada generated a culture in which the people are afraid of to approach the subject of the death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Médicalisation or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative cares, we retrieve the experts authorized by the Royal Corporation of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish that have most of the Canadians to die to the house, 68.6% of them end up to die to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> As a whole, country, it is at the Quebec that this rate is the highest one, with 86% of the deaths arising to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the delicate question of euthanasia and attended suicide, the authors of the report arrive to conclusions that go in opposition to the position of the federal government, that already said to want nothing to change to the criminal Code concerning euthanasia and the attended suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Now, according to the experts, that equally reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or décriminalisées, there is not any proof that this induced decriminalization of the abuses in the application, that is to say the practice of euthanasia or attended suicide on of the non competent people or not consenting. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, asserted yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, one would rediscover more numerous case of these floods precisely in the countries where euthanasia and the attended suicide are not legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practiced to Canada, where she is clearly illegal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;The attended suicide is practiced to Canada, where it is clearly illegal&quot;, explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians in favor of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let&apos;s recall that 85% of the Canadians already pronounced themselves in favor of euthanasia because they believe that she would allow the people in end of life to reduce their sufferings, according to a poll Angus Reid carried out in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% swellings that the fact to legalize euthanasia will not have for effect to send the message that the life of the elderly or handicapped people has less than value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people having practiced the attended suicide, the probes estimate to 41% that they should not be followed. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> Regarding maintenance or of suspension of the cares with a patient, the position is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the criminal Code that the collection of the cares for which there was a refusal legally validates is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The committee of required experts as as the professionals of health are formed to the duty to respect a refusal of the cares in life end, without being afraid of the criminal pursuits. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Regarding cares palliative, the committee claims that the governments, the health care institutions, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative cares, and that, beyond the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> At last, regarding sedation palliative or final, already widely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the required committee that she is considered, when she does not serve to reduce the physical pain, as euthanasia, and that she is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reserves of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Certain experts in the domain of the right of health already emitted reserves concerning the conclusions of the report of the experts of the royal Corporation of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Me Rock Deschamps, specialist in right of health, qualified of&quot; extreme&quot; the position of the signatory experts of the report, among others things because she not limit the practice of the euthanasia to the patients in final phase. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;That opens the door to a position where all an each that would be tired from life and that would have more than 18 years could ask this than one helps it to commit suicide&quot;, says Me Deschamps, that had consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Me Deschamps underlines as as the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in social fabric of the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Now, &quot;in corporation, he says, there are beacons and constraints&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist of the right of health Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;a strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, that she qualified of &quot;shows pro euthanasia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, that is itself member of the Royal Corporation of Canada, protests in particular the data of the report as for the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and the attended suicide are legalized, is at the Netherlands and in Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2625"> It is the social chancellor democrat Werner Faymann that even announced him this decision to the coming from a counsel of the ministers, while the Austrian public debt is of 74.6%, widely above the criterion of 60% maximum fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht, but clearly underneath the country debts as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the creditworthiness of Austria was lowered only of a single notch, of AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion Euros of interests what&apos;s more each year&quot;, argued the vice chancellor and christian democrat minister of the foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria gives thus after a request of the summit to Brussels of the member nations of the Euro zone of October 26 last one: the bosses of State and of government then had claimed the here inscription at the end of 2012 reduction of the public deficits and of a return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or in a law of same value. </seg>

<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene as we did it the last time if we note an excessive volatility&quot; in the rate of change of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Tuesday, the yen climbed back up not far from the historic levels that pushed Japanese authorities to intervene October 31. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo massively sold yens against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese motto that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 facing the green ticket. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen uniformly is climbed back up since, doped by purchases of investors that consider it as a &quot;value refuge&quot; in these uncertain times of world-wide economical slowdown and of crisis of debt in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar is ironed Tuesday under the 77 yens and the Euro brought down under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, nearby levels having released the last intervention. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energetic political: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts must take it on dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If it is a subject that one not can treat from considerations of current term or under the blow of l&quot; emotion, this is well the energetic political. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and the cost of l&quot; influential electricity directly on the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of the businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that an electoral appointment is the occasion to reflect to such issues and to the place that there holds nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be fructueux only if it explores the body of the economical, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must be founded their opinion on facts objectives, rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billions d&quot; human beings on the planet, l&quot; demographic evolution will induce a doubly request d&quot; here electricity to 2050, without depriving a huge party of the world-wide population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the rarefaction of the fossil resources to continue to produce l&quot; electricity in permanence, without forgetting the pressing necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas transmissions to fight against the climatic dérèglement, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima does not modify anything of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> This is the reason why Germany remains isolated in his decision to renounce nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case or of Belgium, that submits hers to the necessity to be able to find a replacement source able to substitute itself, or Switzerland, that hears just more to construct only central of last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, the Great Britain, Finland, the Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for quote only them, follow their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, them, decided after Fukushima to add a unity to their park while resuming the construction of a central one interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, centered on the renewable energies, sometimes is presented as an example, the reality annoys the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will translate itself by the renchérissement of the price of l&quot; electricity, an energetic dependance worsened by increased recourse to the imported gas, in particular of Russia, a leap of the transmissions of CARBON DIOXIDE induced by the construction of central ones to the gas and to coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In some months, the body of these unfortunate effects do themselves already to feel. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to be meditated. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe of l&quot; wind, of which it pulls 30% of his electricity, it is also the one of the biggest users of coal and of gas owing to the intermittence of the wind; by virtue of what, its transmissions of CARBON DIOXIDE and the price of his electricity respectively are 65% and 50% more students than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our political energetic one, our neighbors acquit a bill d&quot; superior electricity of 40% to the one of the French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy the cost of l&quot; energy constitutes a factor key of competitiveness and a pledge of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, the French businesses benefit from l&quot; least dear electricity of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Therefore, any significant reduction from nuclear power would generate a strong increase of the price of l&quot; electricity, that would render illusory the beautiful declarations on the réindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a wide majority of French refuse themselves to pay, of as much as they do not show any opposition of principle to this energy, the polls show it. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let&apos;s recall that the energetic political one of our country allowed building an industrial system of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs induce. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strongly exporting, she induces a galaxy of specialized SMES on the international markets and the return very creators of non able to be relocated jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France came to decide go out of nuclear power, this would be to sacrifice good number of these SMES while reducing as sorrow skin the 6 annual billion Euros of French exportations d&quot; equipments and nuclear services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which electrician would order a conceived EPR to work sixty years while the decline of his manufacturer would be programed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To resolve l&quot; energetic equation, it is necessary to admit that it does not exist any source of production d&quot; electricity miracle, not more than it not some exists of devilish one. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by solution Areva not very transmitting of CARBON DIOXIDE, nuclear and renewable, indicates the complementarity of the sources d&quot; energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For nuclear power, maintain the highest level of safety is an imperative absolute one. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> We have in France an Authority of safety that exercises an intransigent and transparent check on the central existing one as on the work-site of Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, of which professionalism is recognized, are lived same obsession of safety. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In a half century, the nuclear industry knew three accidents engrave. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> A single one, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal exploitation; there remained without human or environmental consequence. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> To Tchernobyl, the conception of the reactor and human faults impardonnables provoked the drama. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> To Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented extent that caused the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will pull the teachings of this accident, as her had done it for the two preceding ones. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Fruit of this gait and of a cooperation between safety authorities, the exploiting and the French and German builders the EPR presents a conception returning it able to withstand of such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While it is considered by all the desirous electricians to construct a central one, the stop of his construction to Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offer to the competitors of Areva and EDF while their leash the free way to seize itself leadership in the essential development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate to look for the better energetic bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave l&quot; emotion, dogmas and the maneuvers partisanes to dominate a debate so determining for the financial situation, social and financial of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is the immigration a load or a luck for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The political regarding immigration conducted one under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under various angles -glut of the services policemen, judicial and administrative subject to politics of the figure, compatibility of this political one with the self-proclaimed statute of &quot;country of the human rights&quot; France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is administrative harassment of which are the subject them foreign students that did the current event, the minister of the Interior (to read May 23 Liberation) proclaiming to the passage that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, of masons and of waiters of restaurant&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But she is only rarely analyzed under the economical angle. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is that there is on this subject a rather wide consensus between left and upright. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> To right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac that declared in 1976 that &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in an understanding country close to 2 millions of immigrated workers&quot;, and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot welcome the very misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided to the left as to right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived as a load for the economy and the French corporation. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference be anxious the degree of generosity that one will deign to grant with respect to the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In his program, François Holland restricts itself to triteness, indicating that the codéveloppement will allow resolving our &quot;migratory problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, is maybe paying electorally; but she is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the recall the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthesizing the knowledge more recent on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages.), it exists a wide consensus among the specialists on positive impact of the migratory flows on the economical growth, the salaries and the job in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restrict the immigration weakens the growth and night to the job. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears with respect to the impact of the migrant ones are based on the idea that these risk substituting itself to the national workers, all particularly the not very qualified ones, exercising a pressure downwards on their salaries. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are a lot more supplementary than substitute to the national employees, exercising for the bulk of the trades in sectors in job scarcity. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The immigrants not very qualified work in sectors that do not attract the national employees, and the done more qualify in dynamic sectors in which these the formation does not follow the offer of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on the salaries </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Same manner that a surgeon will have trouble to work in a country that knows a scarcity of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between national and migrant do that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the job of the national ones. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows induces an understood increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real salaries in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the Fact that the variety brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economical growth (strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the prices Nobel American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were been founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrant ones are also net contributors of the social systems, in average to height of 1% of the total budget in the European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The world-wide organization of the work estimates for example that, in Germany, an arriving immigrant at the age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (recipes less spend) of 150000 Euros to the public budgets in average on the body of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, to be going to look for the lacking points of growth &quot;with the teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth in question, using it to dissuade the immigrants, had the exact inverse effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented the democracy, remains to think the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The democracy is a precious good; this is also a fragile good. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able itself in to remember him that, to have invented it to Athens more than two thousand years ago, knew to alongside the XXe century the tragedies of the Big War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but so French in Spain, Salazar to the Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some were able to believe that it would suffice, for that the democracy prevailed definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it manner more direct that is. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> One knows, since Napoléon &quot;the Small one&quot;, that it was a matter there of an ease of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal vote, to be the necessary condition of the democracy, not some is the sufficient condition and even can be done &quot;oppression instrument&quot; as said formerly the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, the democracy requires well more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a check of the strengths, an education, Lights, economical and social solidarities, a justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis of Europe that we live is an economical crisis, but she is all as much and first a crisis of the political one and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The palinodie of the false true Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: the one of the powerful necessity of a return of the political one, but also the one of the disrupting feeling of his impossibility, of his incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be surpassed. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today moved itself, and that, for a lot of them, the republican soldiers no longer pull in the good direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to win to demand a succession of national referenda, organized to the taste necessities and in dispersed order. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free hand to the European absolute monarch or an on foot joined jumps in the emptiness of the nationalist fold: which choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want any cleavers but an exercise, common, of full right, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is not crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, to the Portugal - one would not know besides where to stop l&quot; enumeration - for there is only a crisis, and she is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is Europe completely that folds itself to the diktats of the markets and credit agencies, that suffers as a result of his powerlessness and of his defect of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is Europe completely that is humiliated on the international scene. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> One worries about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - but it is Europe completely that loses gently his sovereignty, and with her each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency, this is to give again to the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project. </seg>

<seg id="2761"> The go out of crisis will suppose decisions at the European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, safe of course to drive us to the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After a long time to have fought this suggestion of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone claims today the European economical government. </seg>

<seg id="2773"> The world-wide parlor of the card to flea opens Tuesday to Villepinte, close to Paris, in a climate optimist. </seg>

<seg id="2779"> Some 26 millions of bank cards already Aimed are equipped of this functionality and 75,000 final ones of payment accept it. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Aimed were deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But the hypermarkets put the mouthfuls double. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Intersection thus emitted this year 2.5 millions of cards Step MasterCard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To pass to superior speed, it is necessary henceforth that the banks equip their customers. </seg>

<seg id="2787"> Few devices today are equipped technology NFC (Near Field Communication) essential to carry out transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They took delay&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they at last should know a true leap the next year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We bank on the sale of 80 to 120 millions of unities in 2012 in the world&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>

<seg id="2796"> Sahara to the Nigeria, the terrorist forehead spreads itself </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris worries about the links between Al qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Suspected of long date, the links between the terrorist group Al qaida to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram confirm themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Sunday, the vice minister Algerian of the foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even asserted that Algiers has some henceforth &quot;obtain the certainty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The manner of which the two organizations operate and the reports of the services of piece of information show that there is well cooperation&quot;, it explained without more of precision. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to do a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation on the rapt of two French to the Niger in last January would have disclosed links. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close of Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the next day at the same time that several of their abductors at the time of an operation launched by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigators and nigériens had to rediscover several telephone fleas belonging to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the past calls orients about several based speakers to the Mali, to Niger and to the Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France International (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigators: the one takes to a Nigérien that stayed at length to Maiduguri, a city of the north of the Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man that says itself close Aqmi and sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is an advance but it is necessary doubtless to await more definite proofs before to talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;One knows since years that the sect benefits from financial supports and exterior intellectuals and that she shows herself more and more active&quot;, tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> The latter months these &quot;supports&quot; had been more and more evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its methods opératoires, that imply henceforth the recourse to kamikazes or to explosive vehicles more and more complexes and of even bills than those used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, start with Washington, from that time did pressure on Abuja for that it takes into account the problems put by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Nigerian authorities in fact a long time considered the group as a community of enlightened people not very worthy of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A quick success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and iman fondamentaliste Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - that means in haoussa &quot;the western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the Islamic instauration of an emirate in the Moslem north of the Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the known association a quick success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> She becomes politicized and demands a strict respect of the charia while its militant ones engage the fight against the irreligious central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The latter aim first the churches, the bars, the administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the campaigning Boko Haram show themselves particularly active, multiplying the attacks against the commissionerships. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuja is, as to his habit, without nuances. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army invests the city, one counts 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, stopped living, is killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> From that time the sect will toughen itself and leave its fiefs of the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> To last Christmas, she claims an attempt that does 80 deaths to Jos, then another to Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is again to Abuja that Boko Haram takes it out on the reassured QG of the police at the time of an attack commits suicide, his first one. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local seat of the united Nations will be his first international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The terrorist creation of an axis in Africa that would sail Mauritanie to the Somalie while going through the worried Nigeria henceforth all the specialists of the security. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While Aqmi invested the Mali and Niger, that the Somalians of Al chebab operate to the Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, at the time of a discussion to the Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said itself ready &quot;to divide all the pieces of information&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to the republican candidates to the presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> On China, on the Iran, on the assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete simplisme and of ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis can she manage a complex world with simple, indeed simplistic ideas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> To listen the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply the thundering declarations and the short cuts in the matter of foreign political, traditionally a republican strong point. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, on the Iran, on the assistance to Israel, the slogans - often not supported - burst out. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the more better placed in the race to the nomination of the &quot;Big Old Party&quot;, threatened to lead the Chinese in front of the WTO and to question them &quot;for manipulation of their change&quot;, a theme carrier in an America exasperated by the migration of entire sections of his industry towards Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> So worse if that must imply the commercial triggering of a war, it said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of political artificial foreign one, failed to strangle itself facing an attitude that &quot;flatters&quot; the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It called for a muscular but constructive dialog Peking (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, that stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> To the picture of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney equally promised military strikes on the Iran if penalties fail to stop his nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, I will stop the Iran, it boasted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is reelected, they will have the bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> It also promised to increase the military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama to fail to its obligations with respect to this partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The contractor Herman Cain, second candidate the more better placed, posts for his part an embarrassing ignorance of the files. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, it called to oppose the Chinese military threat because Peking &quot;tries to develop a nuclear capacity&quot; - apparently ignorant on account of the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964! </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texan governor Rick Perry, that supports Israel and wants strikes against the Iran, says itself ready, for his part, to engage the American army to the Mexico against the coalitions of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The recourse to the torture against the presumed terrorists, forbids by Obama in 2009, is equally recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> One is far republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a truck in foreign political. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> The opponents of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and as it won the cold war. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama was itself an amateur and that it had to put water in his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist with reason on the naïve failure of his dialog with the Iran, on the too precipitated departure of the &quot;houseboys&quot; of Iraq, on its prevarications in Libya, sticking him thus a label of weak one. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attack is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population judges rather positive the report of national security of Obama, that eliminated Bin LADEN. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> Since the Iraq, she distrusts the military interventions that drive to the enlisement. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, while deducing that it is necessary to rebuild economically the America to revive his leadership, Obama hits more just. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The North Stream, new door of ntrée of the Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas pipeline North Stream, linking up directly western Europe to Russia while passing at the far end of the sea Baltic, entered in service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must furnish gas for the equivalent one of 30 millions of homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the gas giant Russian, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests of which four heads of state and of government participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, to the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that links up directly, under the sea, the Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the flying one of the valve ordering the entry of the Russian gas in the network west European. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new gas pipeline one, 27.5 billion cubic meters additional of Russian gas will arrive each year in Europe western by a first tube of 1 224 km linking up the region of Holy pétersbourg to the mecklembourg-poméranie Land. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube must be finished at the end of 2012, allowing delivering altogether 55 billion cubic meters of gas, is the equivalent one of French the very consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And one already evokes the possibility of some to construct a third one on the same traverses. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the achievement in time and in hour of this huge work-site has airs of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project strongly had been protested by the Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The North Stream in fact will allow delivering gas directly in Germany, while avoiding any passage earthly by a world third nation (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries lose a little their Power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia while threatening of him to close the access to the markets wests European. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> To the more fort of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a &quot;new Soviet German pact&quot;, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy the Poland, in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This is to say if the subject is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Europe of the West, while bringing its support for this Russian project, there won a bigger security of its supplying. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But this is at the price of a weakening of Europe of the energy, since the project created a gap between European of the East and West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia knew, in five years scarcely, let his vision of a direct alliance prevail between Russia and the rich western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and of which the deposits are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas pipeline is one composing from our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that secures us in a manner organic&quot;, confirmed François Fillon while inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing to which not at all the big gas contracts are as political as economical. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All that explains the wide ones smile posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline is equally a technical exploit. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine tube is in sheathed steel of concrete in order to protect it against the anchors of the vessels. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m in average. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;A hundred must have been removed or destroyed, as a precaution&quot;, indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the corporation North Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It was necessary also to multiply the measures to protect the wildlife and the flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, that nothing interrupts on all his length: or valve, or station of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A check platform was foreseen to the wide one Sweden, but the people in charge of the project there renounced while the Swedish one were not very desirous to see a corporation of Russian State to establish itself in a manner permanent to the wide one of their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damages, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute&quot;, precise Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of escape, the contained gas in the gas pipeline escapes therefore in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is judged not very probable by the builders that foresaw the solders to know an escape all the 100 000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The supervision of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by a submarine robot, led by a vessel, for the exterior observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> To the arrival, after three complete days of travels to the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers precise the news on the eventual deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas pipeline was conceived to work fifty years without having to undergo the least repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The circulation of the gas simply is assured by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> She is of 200 bars at the start, and of 100 to the arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five corporations united their forces to realize this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader remains Gazprom, that keeps 51% of the parts. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Itself there joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five corporations created a common business, named North Stream, in charge of constructing and to operate the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> She has his seat to Zoug, in Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom next rented to this corporation, for twenty renewable years, the entirety of the capacities of transportation of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the quantity of actually transported gas&quot;, precise Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was assured to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank ready. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the works should attain the 7.4 billion Euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, the investment brought up itself to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But the minority shareholders are sure to return in their expense, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a coastal planted sablonneux of pines. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valves, high of 4.5 meters, form the door of go out of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and the specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this final one receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas to every hour that passes. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> To full capacity, this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a brand notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created around fifteen years ago by an Italian business, the Moleskine wants to give again the taste of the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an adventure perfume, of past hours to write to the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook Moleskine is easily recognizable, with his black rectangular cover, his rubber band, its leaves of a white color broken, as aged by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Nevertheless, the notebook Moleskine such as one knows it today was born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian business Way Way, based to Milan, decides to the era to launch a notebook of grades design but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Got married Sebregondi, then consultant for the business, loads itself with the launch of the new produce one. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook inspires itself of a former technique of production, the mole skin (mole skin) that designates a cotton varnish used to cover with the feast for example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This notebook type was very prized writers and travelers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine put back to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, that was an icon of the artists before gardistes, to THE XX e century&quot;, relates Got married Sebregondi, become since the person in charge of the brand with Way Way. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is there. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased of 26% to establish itself to 12.7 millions of flowed pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> One is far confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 notebooks were conceived. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine surpasses the Italian borders and exports itself in 70 countries, France until the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to establish a portrait robot of the buyer, for the grade notebook seduces just as well the businessman as the student and the professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> To the picture of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, opened spirit and cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian business, that counted 12 employees to its beginnings, in account almost 100 today and disposes since 2008 of two offices; the one to Milan and the other to New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> She distributes its notebooks in the bookstores, Fnac to the small shops of center city and knew to impose his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the air of the time and this new need of writing, despite the leap of the e-mail&quot;, explains Got married Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exposition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists expose their own notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, she also launched a cover in leopard, to the occasion of the Festival of the film of Locarno. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of his success and of this will have cultural, Moleskine knew to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, slip-covers d&apos;ordinateur.. The brand declines itself on all a range of supports. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that did the envious one: to the fall 2006, Way Way was repurchased by the funds of investment SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why is the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remaining if student? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of the handicapped people are at the research of a work. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15E week for the job of the handicapped opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a public political voluntarist set up in 2005, the unemployment rate of the handicapped people is again two higher time than the average: 19%, against 9% for the body of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, underlines Éric Blanchet, general director of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the job of the handicapped. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress accomplish for fifteen years are considerable. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;To the era, the unemployment rate was not two but three higher time. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;There remains nevertheless again enormously to do. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It is necessary to say that for the handicapped unemployed, the obstacles remain numerous before attaining the job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are rather elderly: 37% have more than 50 years (17% in average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have access to a qualification level not very high: 80% do not have the ferry and on the 2.3 millions of students of the higher education, 10 000 only are handicapped. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> At last, the long-term unemployment is very shed: 53% for the handicapped, against 38% in average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> Brief, as much of criteria that uniquely complicate the return to the job, and that &quot;constitute the knot of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, general director of Springboard, a created association in 1992 to help the businesses to recruit handicapped workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Here for the brakes objectives. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remain the not one says, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A realized study in April by the association ims-entreprendre for the City indicated that manage them questioned have &quot;a level of weak knowledge of the handicap&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of the people in rolling chair, of the deficient psychological one or intellectuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result, the private businesses of more than 20 employees are again far to attain the objective of job of 6% of handicapped workers, set up in a law of... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The last known figures, that date back to 2008, mention a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3%&quot;, indicates White Rock, general director of the Agefiph, the organism in charge of collecting the contributions of the businesses that do not respect this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof: the number of establishments &quot;taxed&quot;, just as the versed amounts, diminished between 2007 and 2011, passing 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and of 606 to 480 million Euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, that increased the contributions, created a strong pressure on the businesses, explains White Rock. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement translates also a true taken one of conscience, in particular in the big groups. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the ministry of the job, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, against 82% of the businesses of 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;That of the happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before confronting the Blue Tuesdays evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that their obtains this friendly game. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> One will not go until to write that there was connivance between them, but the picture is symbolic. </seg>
