<seg id="111"> Stylista must also be good psychologist, says profíci </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the opening paragraph of how he teaches stylisté, so I am a little postěžovala, that it is in its opening hours was a lot. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This I netušila, what will follow. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Three profíků lectures from the field, dress troubled characters and a workshop on how it goes on the place. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse off. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer to the final test, the more information, as well as practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even though the rate held every Saturday and Sunday, is really “ našlapaný. ” </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time, with the head of the Alenkou on (the rate is not the only boy), replaced as a woman who does not have a perfectly souměrnou figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And such is the overwhelming majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone has a short neck, someone checking chlapeckou figure without proper curves and, in turn, someone overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Stylista must know how optically refined broad shoulders, neck or extend to add the curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> U. S. go we so Tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopezové, so more prsa also boky and narrow passport, figure much stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout vyzývavě too. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, is the difference between the passport and boky that skirts or trousers actually sitting down it will then pay to tailor - make at least one such piece on peace. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly you will regret it, because the perfectly - fitting clothes to nezaplacení. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt in peace you feel much better than the one that you constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, odstává in passport, and the like. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Chlapecká character, can afford to wear clothes with řasením, applications, výšivkami or nabíráním. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Such information and types of characters is, of course, a lot, so I am delighted that I have a whole week for it to have all of the information in the heads of utřídila. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And the same fear is that, given the zadanému domestic task is this up. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We have to take into account the current appearance, fashionable style of the figures, and the type of characters. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will be “ dress ” Mirandu Kerrovou, perhaps it you know from the campaigns of Victoria &apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the spirit of jásám, for me personally, I certainly better than that Britney Spearsová, because Christina Aguilera, which recently přibrala perhaps a kilo (please, take into account nadsázku), or mladinká Selena Gomezová. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Oblečky must avoid in magazines or seek online and print out and then graphically process. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, as the result of says, then express our personal style and relationship to grafickému creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Think about graphic website stylingu is important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Stylista, neobléká not only physically, but it also creates a, for example, the so - called product pages in the journals (on specific subjects such as trends handbags, kabáty, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Tell us about it and stylista návrhář Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But it only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Stylista must have a general overview </seg>
<seg id="140"> Saturday &apos;s lecture nabitou information about the kinds of characters zpestřili three guests from the field. </seg>
<seg id="141"> John stylista Pokorný, fashionable návrhář Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and it should be able to use stylista. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a deft move stylista can work with one a piece of clothing in a variety of ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variability in this case is the key. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So to such trenčkot (or if you originally trenchcoat) can wear a classically despite džíny and triko as cover, but it can be replaced, and on the bare body, road and lodičky nafotit as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just roll up their sleeves or límce and now the whole look is different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> “ Play a cope with it, ” emphasized. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But the most I appreciated the following advice: “ you need to work perfectly to know the rules. ” </seg>
<seg id="149"> “ Then it is you can begin to break, ” said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, it is so clear to me why drtíme all those propositions, what with the combine, what, why, when even in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> On the parades, not to mention. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to fotografovi Benovi, in turn, I know that stylista must be prepared to much more options clothes, than it is to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties (that is, ten outfitů), I have to be ready to “ nastajlovat ” at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the fotce clothing looks and operates in combination with other pieces of the sometimes very differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With this, so we have to create a outfitu count. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style is sometimes up to half of the success, we confirmed John Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You only have to look at, which is just a miraculous zpěvačkou, but the image and marketing, have made it the world &apos;s Star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic is not yet access to use the services of stylistů rather cold. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even the familiar faces of him sometimes seen as superfluous (just, you know, something that, as in this vypadám, is a second - tier). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if they are from us people leave a styling, then we count on us with likely imposed completely different (smaller) size, than it really is. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then we can googlovat, find out whether the tabloid, that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and so on. </seg>
<seg id="162"> John and Mario on Sunday asked us to the heart, that is not enough stylistovi focusing in vogue and able to poskládat outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In the course of their work primarily communicates with the people, by putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem. </seg>
<seg id="164"> To be able to predict people nepodbízet, the state for its opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> “ When you want a manager, to her protřídili šatník and put it on a nice pieces, so it cannot vyházet the diaries and say, for God &apos;s sake, it&apos; s a nightmare. ” </seg>
<seg id="166"> “ Find a there at least a few things that pochválíte and will recommend what they wear, ” says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It has also, in particular, has shown that everything has to include the so - called “ placovka ”, or taška on plac. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is the one zapnete around passport and you are at all the paraphernalia. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to clear things, such as the gap, váleček on chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread (with the stylista helped in focení products, such as handbags or hats), special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, as is more (špendlík or other svorka are not permissible, destroyed would dress), or šitíčko. </seg>
<seg id="170"> To just listen more closely to, but we also have a practical test, how we have, as you rightly podlepit shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even with focení from studio, where it is equivalent to the surface, would be podrážka could hurt, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we lepily and lepily. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Nůžkami with shoes nor should we mention that just happens to be damaging. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is therefore need to really zručnost. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario please me, when my creation of an unqualified praise. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The aforementioned zručnost, in fact, is not really my kámoška. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is the only malinký a fraction of what we are about the continuation of a second - rate to listen. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Beginning to me to be more and more clear that address stylingu at professional level is not really a walk in the park, they say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: the run with závodí across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Initially easy ride is because of a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy errors is turning into a routine morning &apos;s path to šichtu. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The ambition is largely managed to meet, but it is no use when no one is clearly did not want to do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new deal with: the run has attracted before issuing a high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised that the age - old race series of Need for Speed once again takes a bit of a new direction and from hratelných of seemed like a game, which would compete in žánru action might not be just a number. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Also, we were wondering what comes out of flowing passages in which the hero of graduating from cars and will take place after its. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as for a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It is potentially a decent arkádové race, but a whole runs down a few unnecessary mistakes, which is in a series of appearing more or less for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible speech laziness of the developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You can see in the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems and personal nature as a solution to a participating in illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Behind the wheel usednete on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to arrive as the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Route is divided into 10 stages, and then, to more than 50 plants. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that each race will go on the other line and the stage are situated in various, sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> One case does not have any sense that the game is still offering the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the environment, moreover, are a lot of fine on the surface, although the technical level grafiky corresponds to the previous series of works. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So this is nothing to write home about. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the mountains zasněžených looks visually very pleasantly. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The race, moreover, are from time to time zpestřeny an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, so, for example, přimotáte in sandy storm, which greatly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> By contrast, in the mountains, you have to be careful that you nezasypala flurry of. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual plants. </seg>
<seg id="203"> It &apos;s not just a few types of, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> The moment was so dedicated to předjet the required number of rivals (essentially a classic race), then again, you are the time (a classic duel with stopkami) and then are waiting for you to duel with the only rival. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In fact, even from time to time připlete and the police, which for your efforts even further inconveniences. </seg>
<seg id="206"> New passages are outside the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Rather, it is not just about such interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone prchá and you him in that you have to help, so that in the right moments tisknete right buttons. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complex. </seg>
<seg id="209"> But the surprise, that these passages in the game is much less than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> As a result, but it is a good thing, because this one does not have the chance to otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that game zpestřují. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Driving the model it follows in the footsteps of previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that in today &apos;s time, it is certainly not kdovíco, but it cannot be said that he was záporem. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you &apos;re looking for a realistic simulation of future, you will have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But akčněji pojatému compete here driving model suits are still quite well, although, in a competition to find a better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Thus far, so all in all right. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems are beginning to emerge for some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike model schedules are already much in order is not a model of the rules of conflict. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Since the game of this type, we do not expect that spočítá complex distortions and collisions, but when virtually no before the crash into any object you do not have the slightest idea, how is your car does, then perhaps it is absolutely everything in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typically in the narrow předjíždění or míjení cars in day - to - day operation of the sometimes only slightly mutually olíznete, but sometimes in almost identical situation ends up your car in wild piruetách. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even flat napadrť. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to a system of restartů that while not particularly perturbed, but rozladí you can reliably. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Restarty are resolved so that if rozmlátíte or out far off course, suits you game back to last a clue to the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But restartů is in every race available only five. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When it is vyčerpáte race, you have to start again from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is rather a gadget in case something goes wrong, than that you can rely on them downright. </seg>

<seg id="313"> Inovátor IBM begins the second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone searched for a word, which accurately express strategy of IBM, the closest would be “ long - term aspect. ” </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public to IBM, a symbol of the technology revolution, is that the firm was seen as a very contemporary, and yet from its inception has passed a hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long - term laid the first head of the company &apos;s visionary, Thomas J. Watson sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He no longer forging a slogan that many of the world &apos;s problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan “ Think! ” happen otiskem, around which will take on a life of future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which in IBM has already started to come back in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> “ For us the IBM means long - term thinking continuous movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered a hundred years, due to the fact that has remained true to its fundamental values and at the same time was not afraid of everything else around change. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us during our first centuries to transform technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second hundred that manage to achieve even more, ” remarked on the anniversary of the current head of the firm &apos;s Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson in the 1930s, made to care for their employees like businessman Baťa finely - people from IBM should as some of the first american employees paid leave, insurance from their employer plus elegant employee his uniform and the sophisticated system to reward the best inventors, and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As a sophisticated has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company has been since the beginning of the brilliance in the exploitation of the talent - as one of the first global companies canceled any discrimination, so I could pick. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In accordance with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan, that Palmisana headed IBM in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> At IBM has been operating for more than 30 years, still holds the position of borrowed from the head of sales, marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is doing so - called jamy, online brainstormingy, of which there is a lot of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is no surprise that the ideas are enough - in a company working almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Institutions with good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> The firm &apos;s position in the business of providing the company&apos; s strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> “ From the beginning, IBM was the concept of institutions, rather than just technology companies, ” said Economistu professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on the IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> “ IBM is not a technology company, but firm, which helps solve byznysové problems for the use of technology, ” said George Colony of the consultancy firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself says, is the difference between the market and enter the market straight to create. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - aka “ the Great Blue ”, as it is for its logo in the United States familiérně dubbed - for a hundred years, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is probably nejvšestrannější technology company, is developing the hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consultancy services in the range of products from websites for nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holds most of patents from all US technology companies and five of its staff received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its inventions belongs to the ATM, payment card, financial swap, a bar code or disketa. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year has become the second - largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations have trefily to taste customers and time - IBM, for example, nepovedla bet on its own operating system axes / 2, online services prodigy or computer IBM PCjr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> “ If your business is built to move forward, you cannot be emotionally focus on the past, ” poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM does not have a problem to build its foundations on many platforms - and when not working, so it is to leave. </seg>
<seg id="346"> The difference to be from rival Microsoft, which essentially stands or falls on the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> In sales, IBM is most engaged the services, after roughly a fifth of is a software and hardware. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Meanwhile, back in 1990, with more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In investment continues even since 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is according to the legacy of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the amount of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The stock price of IBM since the beginning of 2008 has risen by rocket 120 per cent, net profit companies continually rising. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Corporate slogan, IBM is changing everything, not just its values. </seg>

<seg id="481"> How have evolved prices tour since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> In 1989, was in the then - Czechoslovakia allowed only five state tourism offices: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The tour operator at the time, sold in the vast majority of cases, only selling holidays in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West has been very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists and travelling on holiday to the sea in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), to the Soviet Union (Crimea in Sochi on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, and the way the czech tourists in Yugoslavia have subsequently been very limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of socialism, then it was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e., also Čechoslovákům) individually allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In that case, like a citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed from this country zvací letter, not otherwise be individual way possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The tour operator at the time, offering and trips to the West, but it would need to stand in front of overnight with spacákem or be in the office “ well - known ”. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so, however, was not out of the woods. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so - called FX promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, has been granted a “ politically unreliable people ” who could travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovakia &apos;s currency is not freely convertible currency, without the promise of foreign currency and it was not possible to obtain funding currency (western) on the way to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> By far the most often, however, the Czechs to take holidays at home, which was the result of a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travel the Czechs and has experienced since 1989, the real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While in 1989 was leave in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A great irony that are already aware of what it is, in fact, that for us at the moment most popular Croatia was possible in 1989 to travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Early in the 1990 &apos;s, there has been a visa waiver to neighboring west european countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short - term visits, above all, the austrian Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs and Slovaks has long could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone there would at least for a moment look. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris sleeping trips the Czechs in parks in tents, because our then - income nedovolovaly, so that we can pay for a hotel or penzion. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of travel Czechs was in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible, the czech koruna, thus our tourists could, finally, after many years destítkách freely buy western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living, and with that, however, the average pay rise, which ended around 1997 in another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel to travel agents regularly since 1997 to prepare for trips charterovými air spoji, making air travel because of the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales compared with the past incredibly less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 1990s, we should have the Czechs visa - free travel in virtually all of the world &apos;s advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continues to facilitate our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic &apos;s first ever direct charter to exotiky, it was in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From this year, so every year vylétávají with czech tourists direct chartery into warm distant countries, this year &apos;s winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100,000 Czechs per year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this period, which stands for our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> 17 November 2008 abolished the US visa for czech tourists and this is our country definitively as one of the most advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, also for the first time in the history of the Czechs have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holidays, including the cost of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly of has to find the President again but threatens stalemate </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months is the czech football without the president and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Haška at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburce. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral law will proceed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without it, or begins to vote on which of the three candidates will be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Interest to lead the Czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned from office in June and in his retirement urged colleagues to get together and find a strong personality, which would result in football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But in an era of after Haškovi football slipped lately back to tit between the two chambers of the former, which was unable to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Most of it is shown on 16 September, when a new president should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates at the shareholders meeting in the national house in Prague on Smíchově sjeli unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked and this was not just a way of elections. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There is not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials mandated full power. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In the only point since then a partial agreement, which will also help the recommendations of the constitution for the state and the right to representation on the basis of a full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes but still exists about the electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Too much clarity on the situation and introduce an executive committee, who is no longer on their negotiations, whether proper or emergency, does not in fact nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="523"> A glance at the choice has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to ruled out the possibility of stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> “ The dispute is whether to be in line with the statutes, or to find a different model, ” said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Liberty, which in leadership Association represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round of the wins the most of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which is running. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is said to be ready to go at the concession that won the candidate who gets higher sum per cent of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the party is pushing for a condition that the winner must in the percentage of the census to gain at least a two - thirds advantage. </seg>
<seg id="529"> “ But this would then pozbývala sense of two previous rounds, it would be completely negate a bicameral concept, ” sees the objections moravské Party freedom, under which it would be the best law neohýbat and to vote under the existing statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomas Paclík, although it is estimated that &apos;s designed to allow the election law suits from all the candidates most Peltovi. </seg>
<seg id="531"> “ I wish to decide upon a maximum according to the constitution. ” </seg>
<seg id="532"> “ To some espousing nonsense nevymýšlely as the last general meeting, ” said owner of Victoria plzeň, who is running for the first time and in your comments are defined by, in particular, against Peltovi. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In Nymburce according to him, will be the new chairman of I know and believe that the candidates will in future work constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> “ All the passion to reassure potential of today &apos;s action as a national team at the European Championships. ” </seg>
<seg id="536"> “ Football, in turn, will be a lucky streak, will have a greater willingness to cooperate, ” means jablonecký leader myself, which has three of the largest of the whole experience of managing a football as a professional, and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is restrained. </seg>
<seg id="538"> “ I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is a lot of torn apart. ” </seg>
<seg id="539"> “ This is not among the people of the Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts by the ring to adapt to the legislation. ” </seg>
<seg id="540"> “ It can cause that to deadlock on shareholders meeting will happen again. ” </seg>
<seg id="541"> “ However, I hope that common sense will prevail, ” said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> The agreement of all parties have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some of the negotiations, were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether in the struggle will be football generalita not complete. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The aviation speciál, in which should go to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice - presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, from Prague due to a technical disorder morning neodletěl and to look for is spare option, as part of the Executive Committee in the scenes of barážové retribution again. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Perhaps in the end will be decisive meeting at ministerial level, which can be reported on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The education minister, youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to make divided parties within the strongest sports associations in the country to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> At stake is a lot of things: the state subsidies, the credibility of the football and also planned a pile of the vast ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the sport after financial problems sazky. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes to fight on the president, because they cannot see a suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the players&apos; plzně Tomas Paclík before a large pile of extraordinary saw a strong candidate who would comply with all his ideas for a new chairman of the football associations of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor in the battle for the top post sign up. </seg>
<seg id="550"> “ If there is a high - quality adept, bojuju for him and the election of nejdu. ” </seg>
<seg id="551"> “ But in the current situation is not such a failed to find, ” said ČTK Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="552"> In the runoff with Miroslav Peltou and Jindřichem Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Peltovi, alleged favoritovi elections, tried to avoid in the road to lead FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the General Assembly of the good. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In this post, I would like to see in the future, as an experienced and top executive, who is not connected with the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> “ With some of the people who would come in the account, I talked to you. ” </seg>
<seg id="556"> “ For me it was crazy, though some said that at this point, with the czech football don &apos;t want to identify. ” </seg>
<seg id="557"> “ That I would like to change, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Paclíkovi supposedly now most of all it bothers Peltovo connections with the President of plzeňského Regional football association Berbrem Romano, a man with a reputation as a controversial, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclíka is so unacceptable to Pelta appeared in the position. </seg>
<seg id="560"> “ If he won, so the zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would have in football moved forward. ” </seg>
<seg id="561"> “ In combination with the support of Berbra, which is zdatným trader, would that football was not even more, ” said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Alluding to the fact that Peltovo name years ago said in tapping in the investigation of corruption affair, from which Pelta, however, came without punishment. </seg>
<seg id="563"> “ I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. ” </seg>
<seg id="564"> “ And as we also looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, ” said Paclík, which already but also takes with grace its earlier statement that would “ plzeňský sold the club to Pelta became prime. ” </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the event that the Paclík in Thursday &apos;s election triumph, could do but with Peltou envision the future cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="566"> The same thinking and another candidate Rajchl, which supported zářijovou Paclík before a large pile of, which ended in failure. </seg>
<seg id="567"> “ He (Pelta) would be the first, for whom I would go. ” </seg>
<seg id="568"> “ It has a great ability. ” </seg>
<seg id="569"> “ Could I would imagine it to be as the head of representation. ” </seg>
<seg id="570"> “ But manažersky would follow Association has failed. ” </seg>
<seg id="571"> “ I also nestrkám nose where it I can &apos;t, ” said Paclík, which in September, has received a great deal of attention to the fact that he was behind the cancellation of the Commission&apos; s rozhodčích in the head with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced Dagmar Damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík argue that would lead to the association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It refers to the ability of management of private companies, since last summer also heads the educational, which with its support in May celebrated premiérový ligový triumph. </seg>
<seg id="574"> “ I have the strength to take in the football environment something changed, so that contributed to his some cultivation. ” </seg>
<seg id="575"> “ To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which must have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which goes to the unsavoury situations, ” said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to sparťanskému boss Daniel křetínskému. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of the priorities would also found the tightening of relations with the czech FAČR Olympic Committee, through which it for political leaders lobbied for it, to get into the sport has received more money from loterijní taxes. </seg>
<seg id="577"> “ This is one of the key things that should be the new chairman of pay. ” </seg>
<seg id="578"> “ If it comes to the taxation of hazard to declare their political parties, so I understand their argument, but frankly to say where the money will go, ” said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> As a burden now Paclík takes nor its link with plzeňským club, though he claims that the President FAČR should be “ bipartisan ”. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with Jabloncem, Rajchl with the Prague Duklou. </seg>
<seg id="581"> “ It &apos;s not ideal. ” </seg>
<seg id="582"> “ But I do not see any sense in to someone get transferred their shares in plzeňském club and a year - and - a - half there is back, ” said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the election standoff </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before a large pile of Football Association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that, if elected, to work, to be FAČR new statutes, which would in future be definitively eliminate disputes over the electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Jablonecký official is ahead of Thursday &apos;s negotiations in Nymburce optimistic and believes that the election fight significantly dampen the success of today&apos; s national soccer team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before zářijovou neuskutečněnou choice has promised that the entertainment and obtaining financing, if elected, intends to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Before the last elections in a large pile of decided to go at the last minute, and so he can throw a two - month delay to its view of the management of football defended and presented in a wider context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> “ People at all levels of football has been doing a lot of time and expect that, on Thursday will be chairman of the unknown. ” </seg>
<seg id="589"> “ We do feel that it is high time for the Association of someone has led, ” is a man who is associated with particular jabloneckým club, but that for many years served in spartě and the executive committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> And therefore believes that it has enough experience to the czech football managers. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that the current problems with the choice of the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Haška. </seg>
<seg id="592"> “ Unfortunately, in the June general meeting were enacted statutes that are not as perfect as we all thought. ” </seg>
<seg id="593"> “ If nepřipouštěly different interpretations, President, we have had since September, ” Pelta pointed out. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is an overhaul of the most important document civic associations with the book as delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> “ If the president of the tent, I take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to deliver a personal responsibility, if this does not happen. ” </seg>
<seg id="596"> “ It is a matter of principle, without which we can be, ” Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="597"> And, he argues, is trying to nevymezovat against its rivals. </seg>
<seg id="598"> We have already announced that they will be able to see cooperation with Jindřichem Rajchlem, which recognises právnickému because of his education, and he knows that his opponent was his first vice - president. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Long neútočil or Tomé Paclíka, that, on the contrary, to Peltovi thread to dry. </seg>
<seg id="600"> “ Football is a little over a year, has had some successes. ” </seg>
<seg id="601"> “ His attacks, however, were unworthy and a lot of people in a way the election campaign caught off guard by. ” </seg>
<seg id="602"> “ And this is why a number of them are now doubts about his true nature, ” he said in the address protivníkovu Pelta, which supposedly remains committed to proclamations, which announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His most powerful weapon is on his knowledge of football from the lowest competing to attract. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a showpiece of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> “ And also I would have tried to put an end to all the affair from kauzou Bohemians or echoes of last year &apos;s corruption scandal. ” </seg>
<seg id="606"> “ Then I would be going to negotiate with the state and the private sector, to ensure enough money for the whole of football, ” said ČTK šestačtyřicetiletý candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then also promised that his arrival at the head of football would mean no personal cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="608"> “ I would have to be first to identify the individual employees, ” the message on Strahov, where from the long anarchy is understandable anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="609"> In spite of the current disaster scenarios, which is accompanied by the general meeting of the intended, believes that Thursday will delegates to Nymburka unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="610"> “ If it is the only point of contention is how I will vote in the third round, and despite that we can move on. ” </seg>
<seg id="611"> “ Football needs credibility, and there will be the only way that will finally have, in turn, their leader, ” Pelta remains two days ago maybe a decisive day their funkcionářské career optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that it would FAČR began to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> If it were to be the new chairman of the Football Association, the Czech Republic on Thursday &apos;s general meeting as the Vice - President of Henry Rajchl, many people in the association said it would please. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl, promises that, in the case of his election will be hard work. </seg>

<seg id="841"> Why does it not occur to the german authorities have much earlier, after the suspects pátraly in the right - wing extremist circles, it is surprising the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> As with many showing at least rhetorically ready for use of the drastic funding: “ if there continues to be carried out activities so superficial, immigrants have nothing other than their own defence and armed. ” </seg>

<seg id="845"> What it means, if the inner peace in Germany in danger, illuminate the bombings in Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Photographs of spáleniště in Solingen is engraved on the memory of the Germans and Turks. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown here the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans, distrust and distance can result in the right - wing violence </seg>
<seg id="848"> But assassinations have made on the side of the Turks evident feeling of reciprocity. </seg>

<seg id="852"> Quite like that, as the value of the man to measure, according to a height of his taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current turkish news media shows once again how deep is distrust many german Turks in the polities. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the large - scale clarification and new evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal in curyšského Lake </seg>
<seg id="856"> Nejdobrodružnější Bank has headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS has suffered in the financial crisis, almost bankruptcy and since then sliding down from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it has a german compare. </seg>
<seg id="859"> The Axel Weber certainly thought. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his noisy departure for the leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July, a well - known that arrives in 2013 almost as spektakulárního new job: President of the Board of the swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in their careers. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber has enjoyed publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said friendly comments to future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> “ Die UBS has reached a turning point ”. </seg>
<seg id="863"> “ I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswaldem Grübelem. ” </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September, it was clear that everything will not be otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="865"> One dealer from UBS in London has circumvented all safety systems of banks and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the board of directors, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a respected banker, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The president of the board of UBS is since then, as well as opařený - and we all ask: when finally comes, Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already has become a well - known that Weber Bank since February 2012 may advise. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the board will take over the presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday to tell. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber this will be hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, a professor of economics and emission banker and certainly would not have time to translate the needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Then suddenly, will assume responsibility for the banks, which, in turn, could have just one that deserves the title of “ the bank &apos;s biggest scandals in Europe ” </seg>
<seg id="873"> As UBS is both a huge - until recently was the biggest wealth manager in the world - and sliding down, on the other hand, has for years from one to another scandal. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is proud of the Swiss Bank spared. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> In 2007 to enjoy excellent UBS &apos;s reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého manager property is combined with the ambitious goals: would also mean anything in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So it managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money wealthy clients than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And, on the other hand, a move as an investment bank in the league of the world &apos;s biggest banks </seg>
<seg id="880"> That was the impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> A former banker and later a long - term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: “ my students at the time I always UBS cited as a model of good banks. ” </seg>
<seg id="882"> “ From today &apos;s perspective, one asks: how I could so wrong? ” </seg>
<seg id="883"> It was wrong considerably. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something in the UBS properly gone wrong. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, resigned, surprisingly, the head of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, which so far has been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant bankers. </seg>
<seg id="886"> For a few months later I knew why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment bank division has wasted Subprime - Securities and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> For it to defend, UBS is recommending the capital increase of really 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> It found a really investors, however, such that the recently even ohrnovala nose: opaque asian sovereign fund from Singapore and arab state fund, which was so discreet, that one man or nedověděl his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But this was just the first crash. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it was worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to admit a new billion - dollar losses, president of the board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 a second best - paid Board of Switzerland, to step down. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was due to his bad investments in the financial crisis, before they collapsed and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of questionable securities, the Swiss Confederation, has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, which could become a spolumajitelkou banks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole of Switzerland was shaken - as we noted, as is dramatic for a small country, though he has on its territory and big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland (see picture). </seg>
<seg id="897"> “ Once again we could save the UBS ”, says the banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> On the first disaster follows the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> For several months to have capitulated UBS in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to extradite data wealthy customers, who as possible with the help of banks krátili taxes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, agreed with the payment of $780 million - as the return of unjustified profits from these stores including pokutové surcharges. </seg>
<seg id="901"> The UBS has more or less openly that aided by cutting taxes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time, it has lost something, what has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: svatozář discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After this scandal has already been the swiss banking secrecy what earlier. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the resignation of the head of the board of directors and president of the board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of the money customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the bank has lost in the space of a few months, their credibility in both core business areas: in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to make cuts in taxes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it is a bit reassured, just when we thought that UBS will pick up again, here comes the ill - fated trade anabáze: a single dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euros before the Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still must be wrong. </seg>
<seg id="909"> “ The case is about Adoboli discovered that control of the risks of too little has changed, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at Finanz banking Institute University Zürich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> As well as financial director of the big german banks is certain: “ UBS problem lies in the fact that dealing with the control of risk. ” </seg>
<seg id="911"> He was, after all, is the idea of a caution that start off on the swiss bankers a long time ago to become the guardians of large holdings of the world: no too much risk, but security for money - also from this side of the Alpine republic, collapsed in the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Trezory swiss banks have become the symbol of an unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> UBS headquarters in Zurich is more suited to the clichés of good swiss private banks - is just a little bit more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> No location is a classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its main headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to curyšskému jezeru, which is framed zasněženými peak in the swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Klenotnictví as Tiffany &apos;s to find between the swiss traditional stores such as ice Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries, here is the home of swiss banks: from Nationalbank despite Palast der Credit Suisse after an elite private banks such as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The receptionist halls UBS to enter the heavy otáčivými doors. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are obložené mramorem, in front of them a massive kožená seats, in addition to the logo big banks směrovka to “ safety deposit box. ” </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of swiss banks both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - out or they let down, as the head of finding one small swiss private banks. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name would rather he did not want to read in the newspapers, finally closes, as all swiss bankers, also with two velkobankami shops. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS is perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where the extra spread anglosasové. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss may have to have something to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> “ And if, after all, adapt to the long Anglo - Saxon ways. ” </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS changed, leave it initially high profits and then disaster: no european financial Institute have not lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> 15 October 2008 disaster was obvious. </seg>
<seg id="929"> “ In the heart of the next coalition government, the country &apos;s largest small sedmimilionové to rescue action in the history of our nation, ” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der UBS - crash ”. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro approved politicians to rescue from bankruptcy - velkobanku. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How can this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If talks with the swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, have come together two of the three swiss velkobank into massive group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank, which is already in a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and still continue to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Meanwhile, benefited from that, with two different bank UBS predecessors complement: one rich, but ospalá Bank in Zurich with the focus in wealth management and poorer, but internationally heavily involved. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly lost internacionalizovaní investment bankers conveniently to many money with which we can make a lot of roulette. </seg>
<seg id="937"> With the rise of UBS are linked the two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> “ I have always thought that Wuffli Ospel and are the team of the future, ” says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> “ Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, that knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, one driven by sentiment around the stomach, which from banking science has produced entirely up. ” </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel, he argues, to the end of relied on Wuffliho. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli was probably made at the end of a crucial mistakes: “ perhaps the thought that his models are a reality, ” Geiger said. </seg>
<seg id="942"> “ This is a tragic case. ” </seg>
<seg id="943"> The tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> What is clear: the hubris of prior to the crash. </seg>
<seg id="945"> UBS employees are clearly recall the meetings of the directors on which koncernový chief Wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of mines. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She was saying “ League Tables ”, the waiting list, which documents the success of the banks of that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It has sought to UBS on the location of the very top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> A few steps it has succeeded in. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In trading in the currency and stock was part of the game is up. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Corporate advisers, who have been charged with stress, however, one weakness: úrokovém in international trade, in the language of the bankers “ Fixed income ”, perhaps there is a big gap for the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has some gaps in US hypotéčních products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close the gap, determined to UBS to adventure, which it almost cost existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, investing as the bank itself and it - based fund to ensure the risk to US investment Subprime. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Has unfolded in a massive machine, which securities přebaloval on America &apos;s mortgage loans and to further - but I also himself left it risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also, even when other banks have long sought a way out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> “ Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, where UBS buy ”, says the banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> How much is eufórie, so deep a fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager for the second had to go, when attempts to ease a were more difficult than had been thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The position at UBS have become katapultovacím seats and to now be houpou. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads velkobanku now has almost to reduce work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for the bank, which all near business models have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end with the investment banking, the concentration of wealth management, a return to the swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Not so much the Bank is (still) wants to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But investment - banking has severely cut, so it is now clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, wants the new head of the bank &apos;s Sergio Ermotti to present the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 - year old swiss italian has been seen, in fact, not only as an interim solution, though, the bank surprisingly rozešla with the predecessor Grübelem. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, pushed through a: has long - term deals to lead UBS, told curyšská Bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants the investment bank to put back on the situation in the mid - 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3 500 places a dent. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What it wants to make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber has now asked. </seg>

<seg id="1280"> “ The vacuum created from a lack of facts, ” he observed Mr Englund, “ has been filled by estimates, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudice, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fámami. ” </seg>
<seg id="1281"> “ The beauty and sorrow ” follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Nightingale Farmboroughová, english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the flotilla. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are all přebírány of biographies, letters and other already published materials. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Descriptions of their lives can be scary and poutavě, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely living and believable. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them about suffering and dealing with him. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the story of a german author says: “ substitutes, all the substitutes. ” </seg>
<seg id="1286"> “ Substitute for a coffee, imitation, going aluminium, imitation gumy, paper obvazy, wooden knoflíky. ” </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Goes even further, describing a substitute for eating in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> It refers to the “ meat vyrobeném from pressed rice vařené in mutton fat (and supplemented by a false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried bramborových slupek, shoes with wood podrážkami. ” </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Mentions that there were “ 837 registered artificial meat in the production of párků and 511 registered a coffee. ” </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories are about honor and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> One American in itself is internal incentives to divokosti and brutality, and then on the war says: “ at the end of the day, you will understand that it is human nature. not sit in a comfortable seats with a cigarette and whisky, večerními newspapers or a good book and pretend that this your Mask is a civilisation and that behind this škrobeným I in the heart of the secret of the fact no barbar. ” </seg>
<seg id="1292"> On the contrary, a british soldier is aware of that, with the greatest probability soon die and no one has even won &apos;t notice, let alone to mourning. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “ When you finally reconciled that is sacrificed, waited at least, that will happen in front of vděčného audience, ” she writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, however, find it as “ convict who secretly oběsí. ” </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the advent of new horrors. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> “ The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition, ” writes Mr Englund, “ the war between the factories. ” </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Received what is called “ a new sort of beast &apos;s: výřečný and ideologically a staunch serial killer in Chanel střižených for peace, which carries out its bloodshed without rising from the table. ” </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave quite unexpectedly, vileness, alternating with hrdinstvím. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr Englund describes, soldiers, who is from prostitutes deliberately tried to catch some sexual disease, to avoid service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> “ Nejgrotesknějším example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým hnisem that soldiers were buying and curb the genitálie it in the hope that they will end up in the hospital, ” she writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> “ Those are the most desperate vtírali even in the eye, which is often oslepilo until the end of life. ” </seg>

<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small output captures the way in which the war unleashed a “ totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, religious hatred. ” </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are starting to ask, why is their leaders to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books of the First World War, for the most part, rather than with the complex of a work with signs such as “ the First World War and the modern memories ” from Paul Fussella or a novel like “ all quiet on the western front ” from, Erich Maria Remarquea. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Mr Englund prefers nekonvenčnímu concept. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book is the most devastating conclusion, as in populárně naučné literature is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> You will, however, I will not be revealing. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> You will, however, find, as would suddenly jumped from the book &apos;s author, vytrhl you side from the list of heroes of the eye and set it. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After the previous error this time of one minute exactly planned raid </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Part of it has hundreds of police officers, some in přilbách used in the street riots. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> Overnight from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it would by then be Zuccotti Park was nearly empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The action he knew no one except a few high - ranking officers. the other was first said that this is an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> At the forefront of the action was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence stressed how many problems to the police department in operation face. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Allowed to repeat cases in recent weeks, with, for example, to use pepřových sprays against protesters, which have been violated the rules of the department, and a wave of public sympathy spilled on the side of squatterů. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> That is why the police operation, which was intended to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park, launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The leaders were inspired by proběhnuvšími operations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> The massive exercise for the case of behaviour in crisis situations took place in parts of Randalls Iceland, which has been preparing for action in Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Leaders stepped up the so - called training of riot - anti - terrorism measures including the rapid shift in large numbers of police officers, with a focus on the municipality of Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last part of the training was held on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to move into the park was literally “ at the last minute, ” said someone who has been action originally represented only as “ exercise ”. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> “ I know a couple of police officers, who were in this action also called, and certainly no one has said that goes to Zuccotti Park, ” said the person, who spoke only on condition that will remain in anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> “ That goes to Zuccotti Park, knowing only the highest - ranking members of the department. ” </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One of the reasons the secrecy was the lesson for the city once was. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> 14 October should the leaders of the city &apos;s plan to clean up the park, but then backtracked from the plan, because as soon as I heard it on the demonstrators,. them before the start of operations in the park for hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> When the action involved police officers from various units, including the battle groups from around the area - dozens of police officers, who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly explained that during the day in the park are coming up and, in turn, leaving a large number of people, so one hour in the night was an ideal time for the action to start. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> “ It was appropriate to do this at a time when it is in the park as few people as possible, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Than troops knocking, seřadily is on the border of the streets Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt drive, bridge near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of the emergency units with obloukovými lampami and amplióny. </seg>

<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police officers were seen, as are collecting on the edge of the park, so that it could vniknout, if any was needed to carry out the arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters were forced to leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The main spokesman for the Police Department, Paul J. Browne, said that would be the case for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> Many journalists, however, maintains that the police wanted to stop it, to see its troops in action, and in addition to them some police officers were grossly. </seg>

<seg id="1343"> And two people are přivázali to a tree, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Members of the emergency services were called to přeřízli locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Until 3: 30 in the morning, the park has there been any arrests, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The whole operation was completed around 75 minutes later, the sound of the police. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Brown said that in the park were detained around 142 people. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests took place because of “ the riots and the resistance in the arrests, ” explained. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most senior police officer at the scene of the action was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the most senior uniformovaný officer in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The operation was personally involved in also T. Phil Pulaski, the commander of the detektivů on separation. </seg>

<seg id="1352"> The second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadwaye, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for the case, that would be needed to bring the need for it. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park and on the street pine Street, block south of the park, have been vztyčeny roadblocks. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From these places, then police develop protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park. </seg>

<seg id="1361"> The union of relief workers will be to sue the city because of the release </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Unions representing hundreds of school aid workers, who last month have lost their jobs, on Wednesday plan to prosecute the city, saying that the layoffs were necessary, and it was about discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, which are visiting the poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Court cases is probably the last option, which trade unions in the area of District Council 37 remains, in their efforts to overturn the decision of dismissal. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> The 7th of October lost work six hundred and seventy - two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest - paid employees city. their release, the head of union members described as revenge of the city for him last spring allowed access to fund health care spravovanému working četami, through which the city wants to filled a hole in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Officials in the city of this accusation flatly refused. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> On the City Council, which took place last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that layoffs were part of a budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> One of the members of the Council immediately countered by saying that, in the budget is not mentioned anywhere in particular about the release of the aid workers. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Leaders of the urban part of District Council 37, has already announced that fills the necessary documents and warned the Education Ministry, that it will be to sue. on Wednesday svolají press conference, where formally announce its lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Obžalovanými in the process, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while prosecuting party will be eight redundancies, all of whom are afroameričany or hispánci, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomasová, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the city still have not seen before, and therefore to the accusations will not comment. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, with trade unions to focus on the number of redundancies in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims of unfair negotiation. hold the view that the poor schools have lost more assistants, because they are already in the long term are deprived of adequate funding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Iceland nepropouštělo at all and in parts of the Upper East Side minimally, in Brooklynu, in part of the District 23 in Brownsville, have lost their jobs 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, there were even 46 assistants. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> A reminder that in the School of Public School 36 in Harlem work lost five of eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. indictment says: “ this is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents, who may come from the financial resources to compensate for the shortfall in the budget. ” </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the school, Public School 36 was reduced this year on 3,26 per cent and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonusových finance for each přihlášeného poor student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> Unions argue, among other things, that the directors of the secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> In the document was coined to describe the actions used the word “ excess ”, that is, to lift the position, even though that word is more often used to describe the shift of teachers from a charter school in a database available workers, whose salary is paid for by a central authority. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> “ Sixty - six parental coordinators have been released, ” the motion states complaints, “ and not only moved into the database for the position of the available workers. ” </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The mission is at an end, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed on something, in terms of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Before that, however, has had to revolution to succeed, for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the troops the United States closed. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Commission for international relations to the Senate to decide on the comments, which supports Chairman John Kerry (Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful uprisings and american troops to thank for their “ bravery ”. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> “ This statement we want to pay tribute to the courage of the people of Libya, who started with rearranging his country, ” said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> “ Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for democratic aspirations. ” </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The sentence may look innocent, but no debate, which was about Libya, until now, has not been easy. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> Over the years, lawmakers from both parties are constantly arguing among themselves and with the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval, or the military &apos;s refusal to the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, presented to Kerry and McCain resolution authorized the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A proposal in the House was rejected because of the differing views of both political parties, so it is in the Senate never vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day, when he was in the House rejected this proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would put an end to the financing of US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> This is America &apos;s mission in Libya was literally in the legislative očistci - Congress criticised the way in which President Obama directs the mission, but its members of this apparently nedráždilo so much to him in his actions to support. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The hesitancy of Congress eventually overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Rebels captured Tripoli in August and 20 October was killed Gaddafi. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Later, the mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> It is now the Senate may be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Commission for international relations in a statement “ congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and the remarkable resilience, which have invested in an attempt to free his people ” and “ commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its allies, who have been involved in the operation to protect the libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism. ” </seg>
<seg id="1395"> In a statement, also “ confirms the national interest of the United States for a successful and nezvratném transition to democracy in Libya. ” </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new proposal will have the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators again divided into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June draft? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Against the latest version of standing up to Senator Richard G. Lugar (IND), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugarův spokesperson on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has not yet seen. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the House, will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be a top legislative priority almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or else the topic on which will vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers have so far, despite considerable efforts have failed in their proposals through all the way up to the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattův proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were introduced in Congress and apply to a wide range of different topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some of them were the same - same proposal put forward by the House and Senate, and others are only small variations of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of an amendment to a balanced budget and a handful of others, which would like to “ regulate federal spending. ” </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the proposals are not the same thing, but their supporters - especially the onset of Republicans, who want to improve its image - can brag about their “ ownership ”. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, demanded that the addition of a balanced budget vote in the House and the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favor of non - binding declaration of support for the creation of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> In addition to the budget wants to several members also discuss the limit on the number of times, in which members of Congress could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of amendments that would, among other things, guaranteeing the right to a quality education and medical care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> A proposal remains amendment banning same - sex marriage and the addition of banning the burning national flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancelling of federal laws in the case against them will stand up to two - thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Although it seems that are members of Congress in the design of the various amendments very active, compared with previous years, however, it does not significantly nevybočují of average. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In 111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in 100. Congress was 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate members of libraries offer every two years, more than 150 amendments. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> Not, however, a much more successful than the current politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment, which has been added - 27. rider - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was designed by Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> “ Zmlácená, but not defeated, ” says Giffordová in his first television interview since the shootings </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after it from the immediate vicinity of poranil shooter at a public meeting with constituents in Tucsonu, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) on Monday evening, appeared on national television, sing, together with the jingle from broadwayské show “ The Sun Will Come out Tomorrow ” and said that more than a return to Congress is on it to health. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> Giffordsová appeared in order of the “ 20 / 20 ” on ABC News station with Diane Sawyerovou. it can be seen that the creation of sentences will still have difficulty walking in and needed help. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The entire board documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injuries caused by the bullet, which it at the front to get through lebku, has left half of the brain and behind her came off the top of my head out. </seg>

<seg id="1426"> At videích, which natočil Kelly during the first week, it is possible to see Giffordsová in hospital beds with vyholenou head and a long scar across the front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> While her husband is encouraging, fails to at that time, more than just pick up one or two fingers. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, it is Giffordsová captures how sitting in a chair and therapists kolečkovém it teaches us how to implement the simple activity. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> Pokývání head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Vyšpulení lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, its first floor: “ what. ” </seg>
<seg id="1432"> Within a couple of days Giffordsová made another word - “ toast ”, when dožadovala changes in their breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos odvysílaná broadcaster ABC show that a central role for recovery Giffordsové played music: Kongresmanka on them singing along with terapeutem to tune to písním “ Girls just Wanna Have fun ” from Cyndi Lauperové and “ Free Fallin ” ” from Tom Pettyho. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview Giffordová, which pays for two hours daily therapy, Sawyerové revealed that the day of the shootings, nothing can remember. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that Giffordové read newspaper articles about the shootings until March 12, when he first asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> From the shootings is suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where forcibly lodged under the influence of drugs awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> “ A lot of people have died, ” said Giffordsová Sawyerové. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> “ Terrible, terrible, terrible. ” </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly Sawyerové revealed that at one point his wife during the recovery has said: “ I have lost. ” </seg>
<seg id="1440"> “ So I just said to her: Gabby, neprohrálas, ” describing the Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> “ Not only are you got nakládačku. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> But those that zvládneš, you have together and vrátíš is even stronger than ever before. ” </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Military units have encountered sympathetically rather than with respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was galavečerem on Wall Street, that brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang baladu of helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Since around him hundreds of soldiers, sailors, letců and mariňáků. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Solemnly oblečený crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> “ The men and women serving in the armed forces were regarded as heroes, ” said David Saltzman, who held a spring benefici. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> The evening was also present, the then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff. apart from him on the ground, and Admiral Mike Mullen, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> “ All have been presented as a band of orphans, ” the officer wrote in an e - mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers thought well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So completely opposite impressions just illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The army is bezbřeze included praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But this praise worth something, say soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly acts as if an individual in uniform regretted. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> “ We are not at all victims, ” said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> “ It seems that the only way to some of us can support, is to put us in the position of the unfortunate soul. ” </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This issue is very sensitive to the army commanders, who do not want to look like nevděčně or harm relations with the public, which serves. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> We also recognize that anger, which have had to face the troops returning from Vietnam, once was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> The result is that the majority of the words of regret is pronášena quietly and privately between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> When you have two sons retired Colonel Mark Cancian returning from combat operations, where he served as members of the marines, warned of their father on their service will be people outside the military look from two angles. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> From the point of view of some will feel the respect and awe, because we beat the hostile rebels and visited exotická jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> But others will be drilling head, whether it is “ under the surface hiding evil violent veteran, ” said Cancian, who was involved in the fighting in Iraq and to return to take his place in Washington in the government. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> He argued that when looking for work, and some of the people who were with him doing interviews, quietly indicated whether so soon after returning to the fight will be able to withstand stress, which is linked to work in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> “ When you talk about their service, you have to count on the negative reactions, ” lectured Cancian their sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Concern army partly stems from America &apos;s indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The successes on the battlefield rarely get the recognition in the country, which has its own army only small awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just a few of their own benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> “ As a nation we are already nevážíme military heroism as it used to be normal for the Second World War, ” said Lieutenant - General David Barno, who commanded the american troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focused mostly on the suffering of men in arms. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The soldiers are vyznamenáváni for the number of events, which přetrpěli, many friends, who have lost, or for the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week to determine whether it will be launched a judicial process 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in the case of rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, they are prepared to file a lawsuit, hundreds of other applicants. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Vojínovi Class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when it was allegedly raped by a colleague from the army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It happened in October 2008 and she was flowing into the barracks on the air base of Miramar north of San Diego. after dinner with crony hits on her male colleague hand a box with 12 pivy. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her whether it can add, that would make it to the room to a little popít. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> “ In Title I came on warning light, ” described Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the native Texasan its objections completely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> “ It is from Texas, ” she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> “ I wish I listened to his instincts. ” </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Claims that only a few minutes after went into her room, a man to come, threw her on the bed and rape. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military &apos;s wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. this will take place in Arlington in Virginia and go in there about whether the allegations against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeldovi, gets up before the court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Charges have been filed in February, the Washington lawyer Susan Burkeovou and the plaintiffs had at the time, 17 members. over the coming months, however, their numbers have grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of these útků failed in the investigation, and any punishment for the pursuit of justice. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burkeová argues that it is for the neck of the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem begins just for them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> “ The army is direktivním system, ” he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> “ Who are the people who are in a position to avoid an attempt to introduce measures against such things? high command. ” </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burkeová also says that since February in contact with at least 400 other survivors, many of which of them could become part of the other lawsuits lodged in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Its strategy: rather than to seskupila all of the charges in this case - naskládala all eggs in one basket, as she says - will sue in more different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolevil. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team for the Department of Defense is leading the state representative of the United States Neil MacBride, who, along with her colleagues instruct them to reject the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek stated in detail, pick up a strategy of defence, in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot army to sue for injuries, which have suffered as members of the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 - called as the Feres Doctrine is the federal government responsible for injuries, which suffers soldiers in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> “ The alleged injuries related to the military services denouncing, ” writes in the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense has refused to comment on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> However, things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Although women still officially allowed to serve in combat, it was just about quibbles: in modern warfare is difficult to find a clear the battle lines. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with the civilian women about certain acts in the war zone. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between the wars there were 150 soldiers female - two - thirds of them directly in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> Now is the time to have to modernise and in the army, explains Burkeová. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> In their struggle is not alone in this case in hand on top of another three legal representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The Yale law school preparing visitors veteránského seminars on legal services lawsuit against the four main military academy for suspected of developing the atmosphere promoting hatred towards women. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> The non - profit organization vietnamese american veterans is collecting evidence for its claim of moving against the army. this complaint is focused on the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, which was reportedly identified for victims of rape, that the army had an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as it is, for example, AMR Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women &apos;s Action Network, it is a completely normal practice. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Her group has already in December to make a proposal suing the state organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for help from people who said they were in the service of sexually attacked. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> In Congress was presented by nine separate proposals, which presented a group of senators and members of both political parties and put them in a series of redress. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> According to the office for prevention and resolution of sexual violence from the Department of Defense, in 2010 there 3 158 sexual assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> This type of attacks, however, remains in most cases neohlášen and, according to the Pentagon &apos;s own estimates, this figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> In a report issued in March, is dismantled the criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half compared to the civilian justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Prosecutors in the case of a representative of Burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Private First Class Lymanová nahlásila, for example, the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> During the night, he says, has been asked to details about her rape reiterated 11 times the various members of the police, the doctors and the commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Took all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found blood - from wounds he has done on the arm. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> About six months later, in April 2009, is a graduate of Lymanová before a court hearing, during which it has been raised questions about whether, on the day of the attack she loved with my friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It was předvoláno six people, which as witnesses on the reputation of vypovídaly in favour of the alleged perpetrators, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> “ I remember the day when the judgment was handed down, ” says Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> “ I had the feeling, that right there on the ground porodím - with screaming I vyběhla from the courtroom. ” </seg>
<seg id="1519"> “ We have put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am my velícímu officer said: this was not his court. was mine. ” </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lymanové directing to attend military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnostikoval breakdown of the figures, which it described as incompetent to service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, from the army without honour and, therefore, even without the right to výsluhu released. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whatever the case Lymanové and other prosecutors will move on to the next phase, or not, we are there for the long haul, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of George Washington University. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> But, notes, “ from my point of view, should be able to move on to the next stage of the examination. ” </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Between them and the judgment, however, is the doctrine, which has come under fire from the first moment, what can see the light of day. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is a few decades behind, because their obligations neudávají adhere to the same level of a motivating incentives and deterrents to. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: “ the chances are heavily against them … but it is important for them to try it. ” </seg>
<seg id="1528"> Change to occur only when they are good people willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, lawyer denouncing, collected hundreds of other people ready to take legal action and will start work on other cases on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> “ We will not stop with the army in this fight, where there will be reform, ” he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or as long as neumřeme, according to what is to come sooner. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have their eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Than Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, it was just another young man, that its anti - immigration views presented on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Braivik, who has admitted to červencovému vraždícímu killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite Breivik could go it alone, in cyberspace is certainly not alone: during the attack spent a lot of time in front of a computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right - wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer with scientists want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But as it is to find? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easily - just to get out on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> “ We realised that we find them, are actually not that difficult, ” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of the recently published reports british research team, which was about the digital populism. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and, thanks to this, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something marketingoví workers are doing for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlettův team across the whole of Europe find a half a million supporters of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and circulated them them ads. but instead, that is their through zvali into the newly established groups or offer any dietary products, is called to fill in a questionnaire, which occurred questions about their level of education, the relationship to violence and optimism, given their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Through Facebook, Bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to get the results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without ever having to leave office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> “ This is a completely new way of doing research, ” notes Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results not so surprising: online supporters of the right - wing groups are mostly young men, which popuzuje rising levels of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But on the other hand, “ those who its online activism combined with off - line activism ” are more reasonable, more democratic, less violent than those who are constantly ukryti for screen computers. ” </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The team &apos;s work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these sites to learn everything from health problems after social trends hiding aktualizacemi Estates, contributions on walls and stisknutými tlačítky “ I like. ” </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Facebook has reported more than 800 million active users. each of them a day on average will provide three different figures, from which the social network does literally “ information supernovu ”, which stands for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is found the word on Facebook, have risen relative to what it was five years ago to almost 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some scientists is the charm of Facebook in that it gives them the opportunity to study people without being had to bother somewhere in the middle of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> “ Before it was that if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ” </seg>
<seg id="1551"> “ You would have to get into a party, where would you but never lose, ” says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> “ All of this Facebook eliminates - simply go directly to them. ” </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> In a recent study doktorky Megan Moreno from universities in Wisconsinu, the research team found that college students, who analysed its a drunken outcomes on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Morenová proposes that peers students website monitoring and came up with the supply of student aid, which publishes too many opileckých status. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> “ The problem can be solved if it can diagnose, ” he told the Washington Post &apos;s Dimitri Christakis, a co - author of doktorky Moreno and director of the Center for Health, behavior and development of children on the children&apos; s Research Institute in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> “ We found a way to identify at - risk children, which would otherwise not have had the chance to discover. ” </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook itself constantly sonduje data of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Information team sites by the statistics on the personal connection status and on St. Valentýna, voter turnout in 2010 and leverage the satisfaction of the nation (mainly using information that we should approach - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site has had its information made available to the treasure to research, as well as the other). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether they like it or not — in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with crony, which is thousands of miles away, it is necessary to website to provide their personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook will become part of the research, which do not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect the data offline. online data, however, are accessible to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> “ I think the majority of users did not imagine that scientists could look into their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a social scientist at the London Knowledge Lab XO laptops, a study in 2006, which was conducted with the use of public Facebook walls of their students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> “ If it was about them, take it so that the information is not just between them and their friends. ” </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Consequently, it is also consider the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even with research offline, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible not to verify, of how much of the information is on the profile and contributions to the walls of the true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> “ What do you say to Facebook, and what do you do outside of Facebook, these are two completely different things, ” explains Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why I Selwin, who spent long years of research on new technologies, thinks that the pencil and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> “ When you go into the real world and talk with real people, this is something that cannot be replaced, ” he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> “ Social research should be on the companies and social activities, and a lot of the heck social activities are still happening offline. ” </seg>
<seg id="1572"> “ The cold and inhumane ”: Anders Behring Breivik participating in his first public court trial </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, in his first public court hearing in Oslo described himself as a champion of the “ resistance ”. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> “ I am a military commander in the norwegian resistance movement and between norskými templářskými knights, ” he said before the court, where 500 people gathered. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> “ I object to the Court of Justice, because you have given the mandate of the organization promoting ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism. ” </seg>
<seg id="1576"> “ Doznávám towards their actions, but nepřiznávám for them not to blame. ” </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue cut off, because “ he did not want to give Breivikovi opportunity that this hearing, use as a platform from which could make their views. ” </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, refused to Breivikovi, which has brought with it a speech prepared to allow, at the end of the hearing to reach out to the relatives of their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also has ordered the police to hold Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media after a period of 4 týnů and announced that the final authorities will have for a period of eight weeks of full control over all its visitors and all korespondencí. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The hearing, attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and the survivors. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some have lost in the hope that they would be able to Breivikovi look into his eyes, others to make sure that he is being held firmly locked. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> We all took part in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> “ It seemed to me that seemed unemotionally and most inhuman way, ” said komentátorovi NRK one of the survivors of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> “ It was not a pleasant, but for me, I can say that, then what I saw and uslyšel suspect, I mentally, meanwhile, moved on a bit further. ” </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, in tmavém suit and blue tie, remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. when they arrive and retreat into the building without trouble in light of our journalists and the surviving in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breivikově bizarre notion that is part of a larger movement “ resistance ”, the judge naznal, that is crazy, and pointed out that there is no evidence that he had any accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> For someone can be consolation that attacks on 22 June, seem to be the work of a single extremists and not of the radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> However, this does not automatically does not diminish the sadness and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of an entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> “ I would like to see has been eliminated as stvůra, but this is not the case, ” said a relative of one of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> “ If yes, everything would be much easier. ” </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 the lessons to be learned from the Lost interview with Stevem Jobsem in film mířícím into cinemas this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> When Steve jobs 5 October died, have started to appear the views of the people, who he compared with Henry Ford - and elect him as his biggest genialitu modern vynálezcem. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> The recently znovuobjeveném Jobsově interview, which was oprášen special for the film, which is in cinemas this week, it will be for all the fans of Apple &apos;s iTunes, the fact that his creative minds perfectly well understood business processes and work behind the flows of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was a fantastic designérem, dream maker and a member of the self - proclaimed hippie movement, but at the same time also pedantským organizer and man that every little detail fits in detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from “ the notion that really is a great idea of 90 per cent of their work … [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a very long way so many work. ” </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995 he worked Bob Cringely on tv, the agenda of the triumph of the computer &apos;s, which was about the dawn of personal computers during the recording took place a unique, more than hour interview. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> By then it was already had 10 years from now, what jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with their new computer company, Next and eagerly vyhlížel, as the general public will accept the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In tv, the agenda was eventually used a short part of the entire Cringelyho interview and on the original copies interview with tradovalo, that have been lost in transit. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Shortly after the Jobsově penalty, however, were found in režisérově VHS copies of the garage. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového film Steve jobs lost: an interview, which is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who was famous for her distaste for the provision of talks here longer, jobs are amazingly enthusiastically, that may be rozpovídat on its technological philosophy and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And it is also proving to be a very thoughtful man. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four times during the interview, between the question and the answer will come a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking, when it is to see how the jobs answer perfectly considers to have it as the most accurate and accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when on the surface of sails Jobsův perfekcionismus when Cringelyho issues are eagerly and popohání him to quickly came to the more important problems and issues. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The interview was natočen before the era of Pixaru, an ipod or iPhonu and is frighteningly prescient example ideas, when jobs&apos; s assessment of what others are doing well and the company &apos;s badly, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to browse the posmrtná assessment Jobsovy careers, but on Jobsovi, which we see as dychtivého dreamer in the prime of his geniality, is something raw and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Here is their own vision of how the matter could and should look like. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Before long, and then, what their ideas, it is also started putting into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is certainly worth noting: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How I learned to be guided by the company: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> “ During the years of the business, I am always asked: “ why are you doing this? ” and the answer is always the same: well, that is how it simply doing. ” </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why does what he does, never on matters relating to the business thinks in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> What I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs goes on to say that describes its effort to simplify accounting in Apple &apos;s iTunes. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> It was absolutely confused by the way in which they have been recorded costs - often with the slogan “ standard ”, the cost of their $could only think. at the moment I decided to get their own way - developed automatic instrument, which guarantee, that could determine the cost of business in our heads. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How did rošťárnu on Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs remembers the “ blue boxes ” that sestrojil with Stevem Wozniakem - equipment, which people can effectively to hack into the phone companies and free of charge to hold the anywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The equipment that was written in the past for many, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue boxes describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Tells how with Wozniakem facility tested using paid phone and during the conversation has left přepojovat from one network AT &amp;amp;amp; T to another, while the use of what the greatest number of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> “ We have not the least půltucetkrát propletli circles around the world, so when we then something zakřičeli into buying the phone, there are about a minute later a second phone call to the door, ” směje is jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> “ We were young and we found ourselves that we can build thing, which is able to manage infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. ” </seg>
<seg id="1621"> You two have been fabricated malinkou věcičku, which managed to control a much more giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think that without it, never emerged company Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues with a description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost through by the end of the blue box. through the middle of the night to call the Vatican and asked about whether he would be able to speak with the Pope, and what is best for issuing Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Gradually drafted increasingly higher - ranking members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, and only just before the phone to wake up and the Pope, the couple rozchechtala and handset asked. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As zamiloval in technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlettem): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> When he was 12 and sháněl spare parts, so that they could stand kmitoměr, found in the telephone number on the list of Bill Hewletta and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Not long after their 20minutovém interview for jobs assured the summer brigádu in the company of Hewlett - Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> “ Incredibly influenced me. that was the only company that I am in the time I have known, and in my view on this, what kind of society is and how to treat their employees. ” </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs later became one of the employees of HP, who visited the corporate research labs in PALO ALTO, which saw the first “ desktop computer, that has ever been made. ” </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was great as the kufr, had the CRT Monitor and I look to him immediately zamiloval. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In my teens, I am in HP moved higher and higher, poflakoval I around the computer and started for him to write programs. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Both are inventing innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In a few places jobs during the conversation is about how are inventing new products for a hand. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of circuit boards, a customer asked for it has compiled together the entire computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Available should only pay 30 days, during which he had to invent, smontovat and add a ready - made equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> When he was later in Apple &apos;s iTunes, remembers the problems they face in the development of computer mice: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> “ I remember how we have quite a wildly squabbled … shouted at me, it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost $300], to me it has stopped talking, I came out and took the designéra. ” </seg>
<seg id="1637"> About 90 days later we were able to produce perfectly reliable mouse for $15. </seg>

<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer a company can be more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> In that moment, no longer dominates the sales and marketing, so companies šéfují people, who are in charge of this, while people who in charge of their own products are played off against from the decision - making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Technological genius, which brought the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - zručnost and technical expertise are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This is exactly what happened in society xerox … </seg>
<seg id="1645"> The company xerox could own a literally the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be ten times more than it is, could be Microsoft 1990s … </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Instead of victory, however, has created a defeat. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> As it takes innovation as a form of art: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> “ Between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work … and how he is making a great idea, and is also changing and growing. ” </seg>
<seg id="1650"> During that time, about a lot of it teach. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> You have to agree to a series of compromises - certain things simply elektrony, glass, robots or factories do not force. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to bear in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and called them together … </seg>
<seg id="1653"> At the end of the day, depending on taste - trying to think of the best things that ever what created the humanity, and, in a way, is trying to translate into what they are doing. </seg>

<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas večeřeli with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case to be addressed the court </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On a day when the Supreme Court picked behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial, the question of whether to take the objection to President Obama &apos;s health care law, two of the judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attending a gala dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court is part of the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident last Thursday, when all nine justices met to discuss the submitted proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases were brought probíraných lawsuit filed by 26 states, questioning the radical overhaul of health care, Congress approved last year by - law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed that the lawsuit heard in March, however, expects 5,5hodinové negotiations, with the result that is even more — unsettling presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at a time of a decision will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> A lawyer, who will stand up in front of the Court and will try to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush administration. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which is already a long summer deals with the advocacy of a conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company, which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations to question the law, called the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which are in the process of stake in huge financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held in Washington hotel a few hours after the debate on the subject of the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> He attended her, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the republican leader in the Senate, and confirmed the opponents of the law on health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> And the marketing of guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: the two judges the actions of the Federalist Society in for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And certainly it is not for nothing that would be in contravention of the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, these judges are exempt from the requirement to observe the behavior, which are subject to lower the federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If not, however, would certainly their behavior were under the principle of C4, who says that “ the judge can participate in events, which are related and other organisations, in order to raise funds, but the judges must not be speaker, the guest of honor, must not be given on the agenda of the action. ” </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in the case, and also the company with huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> “ This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some judges that the Supreme Court has behaved according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ” said Bob Edgar, the president of the organization Common cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> “ The judges eating meat and večeřeli on social benefici together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss his case before the court. ” </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence, and helping to raise funds through this action undermines the feet of any claims of biased, which is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and tell them that they also have no problem combine their legal obligations with action groups, such as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Thomasova wife, Ginni is highly senior conservative campaigner. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, conservatives have argued that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kaganová not with Thomas and Scalia. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kaganová worked as the prosecutor for the government of President Obama, when he first appeared before a court challenge to the law. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Critics kaganové on it is pushing to have renounced participation in the case, and argue that the time for the law has struggled so much, than that may now be disinterested. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kaganová not signalled that it was preparing to step down. </seg>

<seg id="1698"> Many of the airline in the Middle East are among the nations těžícím oil. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the rise in fuel prices - majority that is harmful to the airlines, because it is about one of its biggest cost - is not as decisive, because the country itself on higher oil prices earns. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important, because for them it is just as likely as other airline that might revoking or postpone the dictates of the aircraft because of an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> “ They have such a natural protection, ” he says. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Contract from airline Emirates strengthens the position of leading companies Boeaing on the market with planes with wide - hull and brings in close company Airbus SAS, which I would like to try to disrupt the dominance of the Boeing with its transport model of the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> A victory for the Boeing comes four months after representatives of the Airbus announced that there will be a delay of the first flight of their largest plane A350, which is a direct competitor aircraft 777 - 300ER. </seg>

<seg id="1752"> “ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire portfolio, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the senátorům John McCain, of Arizona, and &apos;s Lindsey Grahamové, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that Congress&apos; s inability to reach a consensus on the budget and, by extension, the so - called attachment to 23% across - the - board decline and stop many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> “ Because of this enormous reduction, used an unwise this way, it will not be possible to implement most of our construction projects or ship - you cannot buy only three - quarters of a building or boats. in addition, there may be a serious damage to other modernization efforts, ” Panetta wrote senátorům. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> “ We will also be forced to retrieve it, many of our civilian employees, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians to send on furlough, in order to be able to meet the requirements. ” </seg>

<seg id="1765"> “ The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed to happen. ” </seg>
<seg id="1766"> “ It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress authorizing the budget and will amplify voices calling on the Pentagon &apos;s omission from the list of seškrtaných areas. </seg>

<seg id="1773"> “ It will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy. ” </seg>
<seg id="1774"> “ As a result, we will welcome the aggression … ” </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In the annex supplied with McCain &apos;s letter and Grahamové Panetta specifies how will be reducing resulted in “ significant operational risks: late response to the crisis, wars and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of operations and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in the future of combat operations. ” </seg>
<seg id="1776"> In addition, Panetta added that some of the greatest defense projects would have to wait for the end, including those that are already being tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> On the list, for example, a project of the plane F35, the planned new bombardéru, ballistic submarines, a new generation of new littoral combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, which like the Army and Marine infantry replace humvee. </seg>

<seg id="2040"> I went to Costa Rica only once, on leave. this is a wonderful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So we have a great joy, that you can bring our music. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask, because this group of literally zbožňují, fans are in these days of preparation is very hard. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you say their nejskalnějším supporters? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you, that you have stood with us so long for a number of years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took us almost 21 years before we get to Costa Rica. thank you, that you have been waiting for so long, and we regret that it took us for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people talk about koncertu already as the greatest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> This raises in you more pressure? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the biggest show, which we have for the last 21 years, came out in a few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have some excellent Show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to a concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> In truth, the concert power forward. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> Love this country, like serfujeme, like the jungle. for both the activities of Costa Rica is the best country in the world. </seg>

<seg id="2054"> My friends from travel to Costa Rica or in Nicaragua, or to Mexico, and those are the best places to surfing, and so we have to Costa Rica, we were told by people who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> If you look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many písněmi. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have you planned on their presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Given that there are never play, there are no restrictions on what we could do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We are going to try to demonstrate what the best show with a variety of skladbami. will try to play a couple of songs from each of the ALBA and imagine our fans good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never neopakujete repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves other compositions, therefore it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we are in the repertoire, two of the three songs, which we played for a long time, we are concentrating on them and also made a surprise, because we remember that, why are we so liked and that we have on this may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> So it is for us to show more interesting, and therefore I think that is interesting and for the people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> This tour celebrate 20 years the artistic career. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> When you look back, it is hard to believe everything you could? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, it certainly. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think, that none of us could imagine, that we will be in one big rock group and that it will remain in more than 20 years. it sounds like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We are aware of how much we were given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> Do we have to be happy, and they like to make music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> We could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What you mean that you were an important part of the grunge žánru? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Always for us it was an honour that we can be part of this group, in which is represented by the same velikáni. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is hardly surprising, when there is a movement of a group of friends, very often it does not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common, so that from one city suddenly came out five to 10 groups. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of that and we are proud to be part of the group that we can from Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes, with some even playing. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains, and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden on tours. we are fortunate that they are all our friends and is an honour, that we can be a part of this movement that began in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also a very unusual for the group as you keep together, and even after those years are still the same members. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is a much longer than is usual duration of the group. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> I think, first of all, that we have all been fortunate that we are still in this world and, secondly, a role played by the fact that they are constantly concerned about one another. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and, thanks to this, we managed to open the musical journey, which let everyone enough freedom to his own experimentation. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> Each other, we believe, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it could be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy. however, thanks to your success, you can do what you like. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How are the balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> How we rostli, has gradually been increasingly easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We are trying to nejezdit too on the circuit, because it is very easy to fall into this trap crowds and the people who love our music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> When you consider that people have come because of the music, that you have to confront the music and what you give it, you must not get carried away with respect. that you famous, rock stars. that neither of us never really was interested not in. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> As you remember another project Mother love bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we were writing great songs, and at the beginning of this was something grand. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> As a band we were three years and we never get any album until after umřel Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> It was very frustrating because it took so long., the most important thing is that it is now přátelíme with Bruce (Fairweather) and Gregem (Gilmore), who started in kapele with us; when we listen to a song or looking at the pictures, I remember how Andy was incredible, as I have with him nasmál. always a pleasure working with him, laughing, talking with a bang or a football and many others. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an incredible person and power is missing. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> National band Las Robertas will be charged with that, in Costa Rica began the show. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you do it is chosen as předskokany? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production has sent videos with several proposals and this group we liked the most, which is why we are wondering what Las Robertas offering face to face and must be very funny. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why always on changing the words Yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He singing and I think that adds up to the first of what it invades. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Who you like basistu influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A lot of people. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> As the first spring to mind Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski … </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There &apos;s so much that I could throughout the evening talking about basistech, who I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has managed to keep the pits Pearl grunge, although they are not in vogue? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that we all felt always slightly separation from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When we think of grunge, presenting the group, to which I have mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the others that have emerged in the same period, and if it is, even now, this music in place, so it is something of a beautiful, because this is the music, which is worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney today play better muziku than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning of the should your music easily bleak nature and now is more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is behind this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting because I feel that in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter - style, but also there are songs as the leading or Juste Breathe, which are considered very glum, although may be as positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> In either of the two, when me is Ed, so I cried, and these are the songs of the deeply dark. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when vyrůstáš and you have in the life of any trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friends, these things start to influence your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that you can be a happy man, and yet we do pochmurnou muziku. </seg>

<seg id="2181"> The President of the urban People &apos;s Party PP at a town hall, Alberto Díaz Fernández, last week called for “ the building was immediately evicted and put an end to this with the problems of civil coexistence, which suffers from neighbors, and with the destruction of the area. ” </seg>
<seg id="2182"> President of people &apos;s explained that, before the summer was zabráno only one floors, but in recent months, the occupiers got into all the pinnacle of buildings and almost all homes, and in one of them, it has even to rip - off. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this respect, he added, that “ there must be an end to impunity and be consistent, if this is a match against civil liability, which occurred in the building. ” </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or the mountains? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Architects have gathered on the occasion of vypsání management, which involves more than about the controversy </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Urban tender for 16 gates again opens the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid - 1980s, at the time the largest heyday of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Letáček defined the mountain as a great park Metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What is more, was accompanied by the comparison with newyorským by Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Then, in 1987, the CMB, Park to come back into the thinking of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. the Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Qualifications Collseroly as natural park was moving in that direction. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> References already was in Central Park, but with Yellowstone divočáky instead of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> That was the position until September, when the city declared a mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry points into Collseroly. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Of course, the idea of recording taken rather Park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone trying to locate a gateway to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> But there is only one question: Collserola, Park or the mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisation on the basis of reflection on the town, the issue becomes a central theme of all the Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already the subject of just otřelé, as when two members of the old caste selected at the meeting in the lift shake hands. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is this feat has caused one of the rare matches between what they think three barcelonští architects and předstoupivší university professors. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection process makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> According to Roldána after načala question of the Gulf, “ should ” discussed on “ the side of the mountain ”, so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples has run its course. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> “ We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona nejrozlehlejším Park is a beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, its great availability. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, ” said architect, for whom the title of “ the gates into the Collserola ” in the “ lexikologickou trap ”: we must not be a “ as input into the park, but rather as a definition of the zones, where it is possible to act. ” </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience of the world urbanismu qualifies as an “ intellectual challenge ” skýtající “ some danger. ” </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The dangers involved in “ uncertainty, which today is a project of public places ” after the experience of the 1980s, which should be in the area of the forum “ its Swan voice. ” </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is the very definition of the border, where should build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> “ Something to define the means to do another step, ” that is, in principle, to move a step further. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> “ We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current (referring to the general Metropolitan plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster ”. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> If we focus on the issue in more detail, Modol believes that a slope údolní Collserola can be considered a “ park, ” but not part of the Barcelona, for reasons of purely topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol also reminded that there is already a work by the Patronat de Collserola, which “ must not end up in the dustbin ”, although welcomes the fact that the city offers his grémiu, that the project will hit from the “ first time ”. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, and they understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a kind of propustkou, which allows architects to engage in the debate, but “ doubt ” that it should be precisely this technical profile, which will be led by a multidisciplinary teams (“ this is all about the skills, ” adds), which is necessary to create: “ the architects should be the only tools. ” </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which has given the title of this game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is missing a global vision Collserola: “ has been declared a 16 tenders, which deal with all the axis of the mountain - Sea, but there is no podélná study, which would have on the field looked and saw it as a whole. ” </seg>
<seg id="2217"> It gives the impression that he at least, up to all 16 tenders. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the project one gates can turn to the concept and the definition of the architect of the neighbouring gates. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his view, the city should ensure that the band was located immediately above ronda de Dalt should ensure in the length of a zone equipment, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens. </seg>

<seg id="2237"> The secretariat for communications and transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed the Secretary of the government &apos;s Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter did not directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot had the chance to try a forced landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, said that before the start of the aircraft pilot said that climate conditions allow for years. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> “ The parts that are appearing, suggests that the unit came up several times to contact with the ground, wings, zapletla into the branches of trees 25 metres from where the unit has lost hulls. ” </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Also reported that the unit was intended for the 19 people, therefore, meets all the requirements to transport staff. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, he said that, on the basis of investigations carried out in terms of the impact on the country, have not been found no components. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> “ In the search for, it was found that parts of the plane were located in a different place, so the plane crashed on the mainland as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> “ The helicopter was designed for the 19 people, meets all the requirements for the transport of people. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Terrain is showing a slope, prone to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> Secretary assured that, at the moment, is the most important to get the results of the investigation as quickly as possible, but it could take several months or even a year. </seg>

<seg id="2249"> The visual years: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the standards of the airplane was years carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, this means that the crew must during a flight to see the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Reporting in AICM put adequate conditions at the start, in line with the plane is moving in the direction of the border between Mexico and the State of DF we saw sections of the cloud of at low altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> The chosen route: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that, due to the cloud of the crew has sought to lower the area and greater visibility to the valley in Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> The location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Souřadnice crashed and the last record a helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that before the crash happened to a loss of control, or to destroy the trajectory of the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The dispersal of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information, which we are currently available, allows us to predict that the impact has been to equal the trajectory and from the side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Nákres scatter remnants of the aircraft suggests that, at the time of the impact on the mainland of helicopter was intact. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> There is no record of a fire or explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> At the site of the accident were not recorded no evidence, which would testify that there was an explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The final results of the investigation show that there may have been a few contacts with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the off - road work had been found the remnants of the aircraft in altitude - 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is svažuje, the tendency is from seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the pictures, which were likely to break up along the route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information provides elements, which seems to suggest that the helicopter could get into contact with the country in a few places. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful searching in the vicinity of the accident on the territory, which is larger than the establishment, have been found the remains of a helicopter, which reinforces belief that the crashed occurred in the state, where the helicopter was still intact. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> Mexico &apos;s Institute of health insurance began research gene, which causes obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Institute of health insurance leads research in order to discover a gene responsible for obesity children and adolescents. research carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Mexico &apos;s Institute of health insurance (IMSS) announced that leads research in order to identify the gene for obesity among children and young. research entitled “ the genetics of obesity among children and adolescents ” to get the results of the overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In the report, the leading research medical units in the biochemistry of specialist hospitals National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, he explained, that was set up a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, experts on nutrition and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the centre of the research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) National polytechnického Institute (IPN.) </seg>
<seg id="2272"> To participate in the research can also the general public, or nemající authorisation. people can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de Mexico City, where it will be every soboru from 8 hours to conduct stress tests by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> To emphasise that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc (the mexican state) and from 8 October, this activity is also in the sports center Nezahualcóyolt (east of Mexico &apos;s state). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> As soon as they obtained data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports center Independencia (south of the Federal) and eventually in the sports centre Morelos (north of Federal Center). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the ingredients and the importance of genetics, in terms of the development of obesity, and traced in Mexico &apos;s children and young people risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, which is celebrating its 14 November, reminded us that the aim is to collect data from three of thousands of children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent of the and under the supervision of the parents, for the use of specific questionnaire about nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity, and the family &apos;s track record hereditary disease in order to avoid risk factors, which could cause diseases such as diabetes or ledvinová inadequacy. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Sure, that every Saturday with all the participants are antropometrická measurement (weight, height, waist size), measured by the blood pressure, is determined by the level of glucose, cholesterol, inzulínu trigliceridů, and studying the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the creation of the child obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects concern over an alarming increase in health workers, the children &apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> “ Health exit polls carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there has been only for boys to the rise in obesity about 77% and for girls to 47%. a dramatic increase in also occurred in the case of overweight, ” said expert from IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the others of their genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Informed that the average Mexičan has a 65% indiánsko - american genetic predispositions, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is routinely explains as failure to burn excess energy they consume (calories) and which carries in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Researcher explained that the direct benefit participants lies in the fact that they will receive the overall assessment of the state of the children, which will see whether they show any known overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> He said that even the presence of vrásek dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and předloktí indicates the likelihood that a person will suffer metabolickými problems and předcukrovkovými positions. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is confidential, doctors it in writing to parents and to explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must carry out to their children avoid disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main ingredients that are causing the overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary life involving the lack of daily physical activity a day vysedávání in front of the television and the use of vehicles instead of walking on a short distance away. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Overweight also causes great kalorický income, which is the greater consumption of slazených drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgry, etc.) high in fats and proteins, and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In the asphalt from UNAM there will be bumps </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrero, a scientist from the department of chemical UNAM creates a modified asfalty with polymery and creating a mixture of drawing better functionality, independently on climatic conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If it is rightly fostering dláždění, it would need to be repaired almost 200,000 výmolů after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de Mexico City, to draw Rafael Nájera Herrero, a scientist from the chemical School (FQ) from UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt dláždění was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of výmolů, or even may be completely removed. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In its přednášce technological cause výmolů, made in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, thereby should rise to mix with similar characteristics like asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resilience, and both at the low, so at high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrero Nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some towns in the north of the country improve. so the functionality and reduce the creation of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the most difficult part of the oil, is a grouping of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with great molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and others with low molecular weight, which are called malteny. together add asphalt typical viskoelastický character. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that, for high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acting as a discharge, in 120 - degree has high viskozitu and in 50 degrees is almost in solid shape, while at low temperatures of asphalt has tended to lámat, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but it changes during the day, according to weather conditions and temperature, draw expert in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> Scientist from the department of chemical observed that most streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, three of which are the latest mixed with asfaltem. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small add zalitými in the asphalt and then stlačenými. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> To emphasise that every block, which is made up of vložku is zalit asfaltem. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> In transit cars or in the creation of the pressure it is possible to force in the ditch well spread. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it were a modified asphalt, spread would be even better, believes the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Add that to the asphalt vložku are the last class called the mantle, consisting of a fine stones, so the sand also zalitým in the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Given that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction of roadway. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Given the fact that, as a part of dláždění will be exposed to the great burden must have the mantle of sufficient width and must be careful not to material from which is zhotoven. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor, which is important to bear in mind, especially water is having a major impact on functionality asfaltové vložky. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Once the terrain vlhký, water is spreading inside and it is difficult to get it out, it causes a softening of all classes dlažby and the emergence of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> He explained that during the creation of výmolů as the first film will eat away at pláště, and then there is damage to asfaltové vložky. to damage but does not occur in one moment, but this is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of through appropriate programmes maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> As a member of a national system of scientists also explained that the burden of the vehicle is another important factor in creating výmolů, and therefore tloušťka each layer dlažby must comply with the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden on the cross. is the only way we can avoid many of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrero pointed out that when it comes to the asphalt, yet we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning of a. is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze, which are in other countries are already available on the market and allow easily repaired bumps without having to use high temperatures. </seg>

<seg id="2314"> Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with that, that was on the podiu vítězek, won a silver crown and šerpu, on the basis of which has become the new first vícemiss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Based on the results of yesterday &apos;s final in Cartageně, in which she won and torch took Miss Atlántico, the département won the title of the first 14. vícemiss. Melina has joined the throngs of women of Valle del Cauca, which are on the verge of a victorious korunce, but at the end of the day have been called the first vícemiss. between them is Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Mrs Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The question many are asking: what was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The result is a big defeat favoritky, which in all the previous rounds have shown, that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and the best face Joile de Volgue. these titles, for example, have reached Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently odnesly and the title of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury chose to name it only the first vícemiss, is the fact that convinced his answer to the question: “ which book you enjoyed the most and why? ” asked by MURILLO Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> On the issue of the candidate replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> “ I read a lot of very. I believe in the role of literature, I believe that this is one form of zkulturňování. book, which I have the most influence in childhood, was “ the Little Prince ”, very profound book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently reading “ crime and punishment ”. it is a book, which is part of a global literature, that we should all know. and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, russian author. this is a wonderful book entitled “ El ardor de la sangre. ” </seg>
<seg id="2322"> The answer is not happy about the term “ culturize ” and, therefore, that she explained what the latter books marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is in a calm and is pleased with the outcome: “ the world is a wise, what is going to happen, it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. ” </seg>
<seg id="2325"> One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the front - runner position. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Bogotský journalist suggested that this, that she has been since the beginning of the most popular, nejoslavovanější and one that I learnt all previous prices (gastronomická challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dresses and the Queen Mother), raising the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo queen, which then on the stage has failed. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> This was evident in the first presentation plavek on the beach Hiltonu and during two parades before final crown. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although on both zářila, was to know that it lacked the strength and vitality, which showed reprezentantky from Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist programme “ at home ” on Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that List, which during the competition will get the most titles at the end of the day, with neodchází korunkou Queen ”. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle in recent days has held the rather nevlídný attitude to the media and that it will pay for. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince porotu on its interest in social work, which are the basis for national beauty contests. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> As an aside, two days before the choice of the international jury member of Luca Doughty said that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of social needs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> “ In the competition Miss Colombia beauty in itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just physical beauty. we need to focus on social conscience and it is important to list before entering the competition, to be involved in such projects, ” explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also, there is speculation that the candidate Valle has lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which was on the abdomen materialising. but this is completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, which it has chosen Miss “ natural beauty ” for the healthiest body, a healthy diet and responsible physical activity. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing for the Queen, acknowledges that Melina had the best body, that there were better girls, “ but the problems with the fibrosis in the abdomen, which in my opinion is not too noticeable, her ubraly points until the last day. ” </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine Cromos believes that myself from Valle made a mistake when he took a couple of surgical procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> “ Surgical interventions are in order, but in the Valle they go wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Her body has never been a strong side here and chose its toll. ” </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this award, which, for the first time, the National Assembly udělovalo beauty, after the parade in her was a cruel forecasts, which are realized. it was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melině allowed that it might eventually give the highest crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina today &apos;s day started year of their softness, not as the Queen, but as a princess, from a position, which gives it the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the national competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, will go down in history as one of the queens, which despite strhujícímu success in Cartageně is the highest korunce received. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Such has been the work of the Cali, which identified a corpse Alfonse Cana </seg>
<seg id="2343"> An expert on the fingerprints of Cali went down in history as the man, who confirmed the death of the “ of Alfonso Cana. ” </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On November 4 last year, an expert on the fingerprints of honor in Cali entered into history as the man who has confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: “ Alfonse Cana ”, and by comparing fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who are working for the department &apos;s honor, was this week on a number of Eliazar González, the men from the Puerta Tejada, 21 years working in the field of research. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career González worked at a town hall in Chocó, where he has had often even more than five days web jungle, to get to the place where they were walking, that there was a need to identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000, the přemístil into the capital of the Valle and after he graduated from the courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. this science deals with studying friction skin, so their hands the hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In a week when it was carried out operations against the Alfonsi Canovi Eliazarovi, said that with the clothes at a minimum of three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> It was expected to something big. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday night, went on a tour of the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that will have to identify two bodies and that podezřívá, that one of them is the man who has led the world &apos;s oldest guerillu. it therefore asked to have taken the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leóna Sáenze (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when he came to the investigating team to a place where there was a mrtvola, have known it because of the physical appearance seemed quite differently. than in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Did not have a beard, oblečený was as a villager in the area, without glasses, a much leaner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But barely do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Along with galtonovou lupou, ink and transplantátorem and light Eliazar began to compare daktylové records the corpses of the minutes of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> It does not mislead the eye: it was a “ Alfonso Cano. ” </seg>
<seg id="2358"> The same night man originally from Puerto Tejada was given to the Minister of Defense, Juanu Carlos Pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed a supreme commander of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The search for clues </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For daktyloskopa from Sijín de Cali, there is a recognition that Eliazarovi González showed President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference the operational services against “ Canovi very significant. ” </seg>
<seg id="2361"> A lot of people don &apos;t know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Daktyloskopie is not an exact science, without the possibility of mistakes that can play a key role in the decision - making process of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In addition to identifying corpses to help these people in research crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identities of people caught. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> If they are caught, a lot of offenders presenting false papers or have Securities at all. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take away the fingerprints and looking for it in a database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Investigator told that in case of injury, had to be in the house to remove a piece of a wall of the house, because at this point, the thief relied for his trezor full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for fingerprints, but in this case we could get stamp on the eye, and to identify the perpetrators, who was involved in several krádežích ”, said. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Not long ago, found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> On the basis of the investigation has found that could be responsible for the murder of one of the family members and the stamp on láhvi it really has confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although it could not be 100%, to confirm that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> An expert on the fingerprints of the honor, explained that the objects with prints of “ blurred through chemical or physical reactive materials. ” </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When there is, and has been for their collection uses transplantátor or the tape. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Stamps are then shipped to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or on registraturu. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> “ The problem is that, as of today, there are still many Kolumbijců, whose data are not included, ” said expert from the honor. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that not everything is so, as it turns out in television programme, CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Like everything is třpytí, gold, is not at all what we make a reference, remain footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, if it can be used, must be carried out on the relevant comparison. </seg>

<seg id="2413"> However, the real wake - up call in the japanese economy is based solely on momentum, which forces taking advantage of the crisis to emerge from it much strengthening, or to rebuild infrastructure. is about to take advantage of the lack of it, is to start from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan is awoke. in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan &apos;s GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The issue of Europe &apos;s future on the programme was not initially, but it became her up in the autumn, in particular, to be satisfying for party members, who see the policy of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> A proposal for the president of the European Commission, given the leadership has been accepted almost in unison. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Only nine of the number of 1001, delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> A few minutes standing ovation from vstoje at the conclusion of the speech of Angela Merkel and, eventually, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, left no room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: “ the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe means peace, but because “ the nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. ” </seg>
<seg id="2466"> According to the Chancellor in Europe, “ the time has come to change. ” </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could give the changes in the Lisbon Treaty for control of the European Union over budgetary policies of member countries of the euro zone, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission, on the basis of universal suffrage, “ in order to give Europe a face. ” </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspirátorem Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> It is certainly a little unlikely that all 27 countries in this revolutionary move quickly agree: is opposed the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU thinks that the same position will also Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>

<seg id="2474"> Only indirectly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> When reminded that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most pokořujících defeats against Napoleonic military. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What a fraud in sick? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After subsidies, triggering the UMP party and government offensive against labour neschopnostem. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux and visiting the office for the provision of social support, where prosloví speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> As escorts for the offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, with most of the right - wing wants to concentrate on sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, because of budgetary savings the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector &apos;s fourth day sick before they begin to take in support of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> To be clear, without the consent of the enterprise, the employee who is ill, he lost four days of wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> The measures, which risks to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos could bring about 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And also the measures, which would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic impact: to give public employees one day nehrazené sick (so far have no failure over three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the right launches also focused on the theme of fraud this time abuses tied with the labor neschopnostmi. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> “ The controls will be much larger and more: if you get, you will come back, ” pointed out Xavier Bertrand in granting an interview station RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed somewhat disproportionate to the truth about nepravostech in job neschopnostech. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressures, which bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The first stop on a couple of official figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to nationale Caisse d &apos;assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies) was in 2006 paid out more than 237 million euro the daily allowance. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute for Research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008, the per diem with its 11.3 billion euros of 5% of spending on health care. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% concerned parent contributions and work - related accidents and 54% on working in default, i. e. 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> So the only 2.5% of the cost of health care. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> According to a study of the Alma Consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The average, which holds some variation: another anketa R. published in 2007 in the pages of the Jobs behemoths. com showed that 75% of those surveyed 40,000 french employees said they have no nevybralo day of disability. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time by institutions sickness insurance, makes it clear that in R. 2010 37,8% of defaults was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 in three months and 11% took longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with its european neighbours, french workers are more prone than elsewhere to work neschopnostem. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence of (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the relative to work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> When it comes to fraud, these are just a small - scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation from R. 2002 ensured that there are systematic controls aimed at working the inability of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, CNAM noted that when 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out because of the short - term neschopnostem “ unwarranted or too long ”, i. e. 37 050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of systemically - controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with napočítalo 11% of cases “ adapted or unjustified ” at 1.2 million checks, i. e. 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A total of 169 so 000 “ unjustified ” cases on several million workers who have been sick. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> The figure, which is much less than the number of its work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to members of the UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euro missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i. e. more than the total amount of the daily allowance and the infinitely more than fraud related to the aforementioned. </seg>

<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians really accepts the opportunity to talk with the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and accepts the decision in this sense. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of the report &apos;s extensive royal canadian companies, which have helped six experts working in different areas, among whom was ethics, law and medicine. </seg>

<seg id="2532"> According to experts, who also scrutinised all countries, where these approaches are legalised or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this odkriminalizování causes any abuse in the app, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides in person or nepříslušné nesouhlasící. </seg>

<seg id="2633"> Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Noda Yošihiko warned on Tuesday that japanese institutions would have to once again in the foreign exchange markets to intervene, if only to continue to strengthen. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> “ We are striking, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility ” in the exchange rate of the yen, explained the Senate Y. Noda. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday only once again rose to historic levels, which 31 October, forced the japanese authorities to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, the Tokyo sold yen for dollars, to reduce the value of the japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But since then, regularly soar by purchases of investors, who see it as a “ safe haven ” in uncertain times, the global economic slowdown and Europe &apos;s crisis caused by the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar on Tuesday again came under 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar 105 yen close to levels that triggered the latest intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis in 2008 - 2009 had the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The flare - up in the japanese currency is detrimental to the island &apos;s exports more costly, because the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of the proceeds obtained by japanese firms from abroad, when it is translated into domestic currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> “ Japan is recovering from zkáz ” caused by the March earthquake and tsunami, which devastated Tohoku region in the north - east of the country, highlighted the Y. Noda, who fears that this expensive yen nezabilo eggs are still in a fragile recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> A third of the world &apos;s economic power restored in the third quarter growth (1.5% given předešlému quarter) and that for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of export growth and household consumption loaded with disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen nereflektovala “ national economy of Japan ”. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Japan &apos;s Finance Minister Jun Azumi called Japan&apos; s central bank (the fight), which launched Tuesday in a two - day meeting of its monetary policy and the Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But víceguvernér this institution Hirohide Yamaguči pointed out that the fight earlier adopted “ appropriate measures ” to suggest that any additional monetary weakening is expected on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> In their last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for emissions securities increased by 5.000 billion yen ($47 billion euros) of their purchases of Treasury bills and rose to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) ceiling sums, which pays for purchases of various securities to inundate with likviditami. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> The eurozone: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Rates are rising, stock markets fail </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The risk of contagion to the debt crisis still undermine european indicators. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and a better figure growth in France and Germany, the rate of the weaker countries are continuing in its growth. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> European stock exchanges still worried about the stability of the euro area is now on Tuesday 15 November sinking into negative expectations. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris in 10 hours index necessary 40 is losing 1.4% on 3.064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The Dax in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% in London and 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> “ With the new tensions around the proceeds of loans to the euro area states, which are in trouble, will continue with the stock markets around the world are passing only part of the recent gains ”. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> “ Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion, ” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The stock market in Tokyo, closing with a drop of 0.7%, which has suffered because of concerns about market participants about Europe &apos;s ability to deal with the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> “ Japan, as well as the rest of the world has eyes intent on figuring out of Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor variations, as long as investors don &apos;t have evidence that the situation has stabilised, ” estimated Mitsušige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The re - launch of uncertainty about the future of the euro currency itself harms, which on Tuesday continues its decline. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro is at the lowest level since the last month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> At 10 o &apos;clock is the european currency value 1,3570 dollar in decline of 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to brokers currency gave up after Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s CDU party at its Congress adopted in Monday&apos; s proposal that incorporate the opportunity to leave the eurozone for the countries that are in trouble, without therefore had to leave the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Italian and spanish rates far beyond the 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The interest rate on the loans in Italy and Spain are on very worrying. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> This morning on Tuesday the proceeds from the sale of the italian 10 - year bonds reaching 6,85% and a return of the spanish 10 - year bonds is 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> This tension operating on interest rates of southern european countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce concerns by market participants. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the future of the italian government, Mario Monti strongly urged the markets on the time to correct the situation in Italy at risk poisoning caused by the size of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October in the eurozone summit will be “ the main task ” of his government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is once again finds itself in a deliberate přímce markets, when the country held in Sunday &apos;s election in the Chamber of Deputies. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The difference rates (“ spread ”) desetiletými bond between Germany and Spain reached a new historical peak. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of the figures oznamujících eurozone growth </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The latest figures say that France has recorded in the third quarter economic growth of 0.4% primarily due to the consumption of households, i. e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> France &apos;s National Institute for statistics and economic studies INSEE however, revised downwards figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP rather than stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And in truth, it is the fourth quarter, which economists worry about most. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> For its part, during the same period, the Germany registered growth of 0.5%. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The initial estimates for the euro area as a whole are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission is to draw attention to the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts they must win over dogma </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is an issue that can grasp on the basis of a short - term balance sheets or under the emotion, then this is the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Disponibilita and the price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and business competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is natural for a meeting in the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the ground, which takes a power from nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful only if we explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must establish its position on the objective facts and rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> So far, it is on the planet 7 billion human beings, but demographics, causing odteďka by 2050 to duplicate the demand for electricity, if we do not want a large chunk of the world &apos;s population to get rid of an important part of life. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, we will need to face a shortage of fossil sources, in order to be able to continue to produce electricity, and cannot be, forget the necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, which is something, which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> An accident involving in Fukushima have no influence on any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> And that is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> But this is not the case in Belgium, which are subordinate to their decisions need to find some other source of capable of replacing oneself or Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power stations. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote, at least some of the country &apos;s continuing with the determination of their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States after Fukushima decided to expand its fleet of one unit of a resumption of the construction of a power plant suspended after the accident at the plant Three pleasantly Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the german model based on renewable energy sometimes presented as an example, the reality is at odds with this. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin appear zdražením electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas importovaném especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions in the wake of the construction of the plants to natural gas and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All of these unpleasant effects will be felt in a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark deserves to be given to him pause. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion in the wind, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, is also one of the world &apos;s largest consumer of coal and gas because of the disturbances of the wind, which are the CO2 emissions and danish higher electricity prices by 65%, or 50%, than the european average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the stable of our energy policy will pay our neighbours electricity bill by 40% higher than the payment of french households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> It is for this reason that any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would give rise to a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make a beautiful illusory statements about re - industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The price that the vast majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as it does not fundamentally against this energy, as polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that our country &apos;s energy policy to stand up to the sector to 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 follow - up job. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strongly exporting sector for us on the international markets a large number of small and medium - sized specialized businesses that create jobs, which cannot be transferred abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France has decided to abandon the core, the sacrifice of a significant number of these small and medium - sized businesses and would come about 6 billion euros per year, which the country receives for exports of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> That plant, the owner, was ordered by the nuclear reactor designed in such a way that worked 60 years, while it was planned by the decline of its producers? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source for the production of energy, and that there is no diabolical. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development of equipment - producing low co2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by french industrial group AREVA testifies to achieve better complementarity sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new plants in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose vocation is recognised, have the idea of security in the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> For 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accident. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The only in the Three Mile Island occurred in normal traffic conditions and left without human victims and the effects on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and unjustifiable human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forgetting that the accident was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will take the lesson to be learned from this accident as well as it did in the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The fruit of the move and cooperation between the french and german authorities on nuclear safety, operators and designers is that type of EPR reactor is a concept that is able to withstand such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all of the candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, it attached to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be a wonderful gift nabídnutým competitors of the AREVA and company EDF and the release of the way for it to seize the lead in the nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is legitimate and necessary to find the best solutions to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible not to emotions, dogma and machinations have dominated the debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation in our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> It is for the economy of the immigration burden or a chance? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles, an oversupply of the police, courts and subjected to administration policy numbers, the compatibility of this policy to the status of “ the country of human rights ”, which boasts of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently it was the administrative harassment, which have been the subject of foreign students, which has become an up - to - date, when Interior Minister (see newspaper Libération on 23 May) said that France “ does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky. ” </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But so far, the only rarely rozebírána under the angle of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It has to be said, that in this area is fairly broad agreement between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac by saying that “ 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million workers immigrants ” and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France “ cannot take all the misery in the world ”. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of invasion hordes polish plumbers on french territory shared on both the right and the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In both camps are immigrants to be seen as a burden for the economy and a french company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the state of grace, who deign to immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme is François Hollande is limited to banalities, though, given that the joint development will solve our “ migration problem. ” </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem may be valid in the elections, economically but it is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As this is reminiscent of the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional PhD: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 page.): between specialist, there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, employment and wages in countries that immigrants are taking. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restrictions on immigration is paralyzed by the growth and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Concerns about the impact caused by the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace french workers, particularly those less - skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But the experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, adding more than náhradníky for french workers by doing work in sectors with a shortage of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují french employees, and the most skilled in fast - moving sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> The positive impact on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as the surgeon will have trouble with work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this supplement between the French and the migrants are causing that came the immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french employees. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri and reckons that growth of migratory movements of 1% to spark a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And while it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalizovaných immigrants among America &apos;s conduits of Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been based immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also in european countries net contributors to the social systems for an average of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The World Organisation of work, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole lives to public budgets net contribution (revenue minus spending) of 150,000 Hiroshima euro. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of his mandate desire is for the lack of growth in “ with vyceněnými teeth. ” </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth to deter immigrants should have just the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented the democracy, there is some european democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is rare, and it &apos;s very fragile goods. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The european continent would be on this should recall, after all, despite the fact that it in Athens over two thousand years invented, experienced during the 20th century. the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also, Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some people to believe that, in order to democracy finally triumphs over their enemies, will be enough to make the choice and implement it in the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> He has, however, already from Napoleon, that it was on the ease of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, although it is the sine qua non of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may become a “ tool of oppression ” as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, the separation of power and control, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but it is just so, and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Admitting mistakes of the greek referendum yes - type will not be in this regard the value of double exposure: uncovering the need for a return of political power, but also a sense of disturbing revelations of his impossibility, his inadequacy. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be promýšlena, so that it can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the lines of the democratic race now relocated and that many of the fighters already nestřílejí in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Nothing we can win, if we require a national referendums held by necessity, and in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank exposed to the absolute monarchovi or leap to their feet tied into the void of the nationalist deep: what kind of choice for citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want to knife the guillotine, but a common, fully - fledged, peaceful and sustained performance of choice and democracy, this time at the european level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Are the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - or we already know, where a list of stop - because of the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> This is, of course, the whole of Europe sklánějící prior to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which are suffering from its failure and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> In fact, it is the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage ponižována. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Zneklidňujeme is in the transfer of sovereignty to the Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Urgently needs to be returned to the management of the european project democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because only Europeans together will be able to reduce the burden of their debt, get rid of the governments of the markets and investment to prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> East of the crisis will assume the decision at a european level, which will not be able to be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would have brought us into disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Then, what we have long fought against this proposal Socialists and Jacques Delors, all today, we strongly call for the european economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So be it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and a passionate such as citizens, would be a new folly and new impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take on a new phase of the building. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To produce the Republic in France, it would need to “ be ” Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution in the interests of this could be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson applies to continue. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to build a Europe, which will be more economically integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> It will be able to make only building Europe more politically democratic and a true european democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Become the Europeans to build Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister alžírského Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria about from now on “ got the certainty ”. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> “ The way in which both organizations operate, and reports of the intelligence services, show that between them, there is a very good cooperation, ” explained without further clarification. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> It seems that Paris has a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the kidnapping of two frenchmen in Niger in January 2010, could help shed light on a springboard. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> After being kidnapped by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in, Niamey, should we be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, the next day killed at the same time as a couple of their captors during the operation, carried out by french special forces. </seg>

<seg id="2806"> An analysis conducted by the call leads to a few people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI) especially interested in investigating two numbers: one leads to Nigérijci, which long resident in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, that is the cradle of boko Haram, and to the other person, which says that is close to AQMI and sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> “ This is progress, but it is, without a doubt, the need to wait for a more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and boko Haram ”. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> “ But it is possible. ” </seg>
<seg id="2810"> “ We have known for years that the sect is pleased with external financial and intellectual support and that is increasingly more actively, ” is tempered by the statements of Nigeria &apos;s Kunle Amuwo investigator. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months has been the “ support ” more and more obvious in the development and speeches boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which include odteďka human victims or more and more complex explosive devices, the same way of implementation, such as equipment used by AQMI. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community on the head with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria, to take into account the problems, which raised boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Nigerian authorities, in fact, long regarded as a community group of enlightened mystics little of interest. </seg>
