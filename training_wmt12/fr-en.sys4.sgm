<seg id="1"> Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="3"> MEPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement, a priori disadvantage with Russia for the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not final, and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymosenko describes the political judgment of revenge of the regime and has caused suspicions of partiality of the court in the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The project to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister has been condemned, has been signed by 147 Members. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Libyan release or rebellion has already been defeated. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It remains to determine the winners. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As it is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Interim National Council has declared the usual Sharia law, and we know what it is. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya is a country without crime because a flight is cut. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women can forget the emancipation, disrespectful of the faith are punishable by the death penalty... </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is the Koran that will unite the personality of the dictator society composed of opposing tribes. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent and as we would certainly not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyan. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted the recognition of dogs infidels. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led the NATO bombing but Allah that they celebrated the greatness in each attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not </seg>
<seg id="23"> We have participated in the shooting, used Islam and our poilitiques were diverted from the dictator as a political ally without brings no benefit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is therefore no problem for the local to get rid of &quot;crusaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> Is that without soil, oil companies will have easy access to libyien black gold. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Perhaps not as much, and the West can finally boast of a desintéressée protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> To prevent these followers of Sharia. </seg>

<seg id="59"> The Czech representation has won also thanks to the super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European championship. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The monténégrains found themselves under pressure in the second part because of a specific Czech defence. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The vicitmes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic missed two chances to score a goal. </seg>
<seg id="62"> And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and a reward of 200 million kronor in the fund of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="63"> In the first minutes we played a warrior football. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The two teams could hardly get combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The pressure of national footballers has not arrived to break the Czech defence which has responded specifically to long shots even during the first time. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They have created a human shield </seg>
<seg id="68"> A few hundred students from graduate schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and takes the deli for lunch </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years were overweight, 9% of écoliersont weight above average and 5% are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As shown by the current research obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This shows once again how important is the environment in which humans and models that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children is an example of the deli 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of obese had dinner fries, according to the survey conducted with an awareness &quot;obesity is not an accident.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of small big sport is not also a habit, which is now the case of most of today&apos;s schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Investigation of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students of primary schools in Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &quot;the Obesity is no coincidence,&quot; supported by the General Insurance and Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the beginning is more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who have enrolled in the project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the key factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or obese, is the lack of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half the children interviewed said for example eat five times a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition,&quot; said one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and dinner Deli </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts draw attention to the fact that a healthy development requires a few basic details such as a breakfast at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the majority of families each takes his breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey showed that in families of obese children often consume unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drink every day drinks sweet (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> More than 40% of children interviewed sport regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Prepares you your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the investigation has allowed selected children (204 boys and girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food options according to their own taste and their personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years away, a healthy diet, the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favourite dishes, there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The most alarming is a large preference for sweet lemonades,&quot; is indicated in the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch the pasta that took the first place just before the white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Children are not at all wanted starch and preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Focus on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The investigation has shown that children are ready to change their habits when they receive the relevant information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;During a review of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the outreach session&quot; obesity is not an accident ,&quot; it was assité with a definite willingness to move towards a healthy diet,&quot; indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most marked example in relation to sweet lemonades because children have begun to give preference to water consumption. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and cut the sweet dishes and &quot;knedliky&quot; (spécialté Czech dumplings meal of bread or potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer should also be a good psychologist, say professionals. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In an article on how to learn for the designers, I am a little bit angry by the fact that there were many from the start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I do not think what would happen. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Presentations of three professional specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The more we are approaching the final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly &quot;packed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the Director Alenka (there is no boy) treaty on how to dress a woman who has no standard measurements. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has a small neck, a body of boy, without any particular curve, another overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer must know how it ammenuiser wide arm, extend a neck or add necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrived to highlight nicely the character and also not dress too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a fine size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is a difference between the size and hips in such a way that skirts or trousers are not, it is worth. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you do not regret it because the clothing that falls neatly is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt you&apos;ll feel much better than in the shifting wraps over and does not take the belt and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a male appearance can afford a dress style Tucker, with pieces of woven fabrics, or embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There is obviously a lot of examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to collect all the information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also fear that what I should do home there too. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality as well as his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will have to &quot;dress up&quot; Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know the Victoria&apos;s Secret of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At the bottom of me, it gives me pleasure, because it is better than dressed Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has taken almost 100 kilograms lately (don&apos;t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the Internet, print and graphics. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard, as we say in the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Also reflect on the graphical portion of the styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The designer clothes not only physical but creates productive pages in magazines (on product trends for handbags, jackets, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, we had all this. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But this,... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer must have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three of the specialty guests gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Pokorny Honza, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talented designer knows how to work with a single dress differently. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is for this important example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Such as the trench coats that must be worn with jeans and a T-shirt like a light coat, but it can also dress the naked body, with escarpins and photo as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or it is enough to lift the sleeves and the collar and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Playing with it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I particularly appreciated the following advice: &quot;For the work you need to know the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You can then begin to break,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why it is trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, whereas in fashion magazines is sometimes something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on fashion. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have a lot more variants of clothing than those who are photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> In other words, for Fashion story which will have a dozen pages (a dozen models) I must be ready to &quot;retailler&quot; at least a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with it during the creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success has been confirmed by Pokorny Honza. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer, but his image and marketing has been a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains cautious. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the familiar faces sometimes considered useless (it is enough that I know something, but what I look at the second). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone is doing a styling on our part, we must then rely on the fact that it teaches us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than it has in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We still have to navigate google and ensure that the news of Boulevard fame, if she has never smoked or grown etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario asked Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the fashion and assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Guess the people, not to pander, retain his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager would ask you to sort out his cupboard and fill new elements you can&apos;t just throw and say, My God! Horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find a few cases that you find beautiful and that you will be discussing with them,&quot; said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It showed us practically everything must contain the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or designer bag. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is the one you fasten around the size and you yourself for everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Besides things clearly defined as scissors, dépilation rolls or even pins nurturer, includes nylon yarn (the designer used to photograph products such as bags, hats), special clips with which closes a garment in the back, if it is too big (or other kind of bar are not utlisables because they might disturb the clothing) or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So that we can not only people who are listening, but who have tried something practical way they taught us how to properly ressemeller shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the soles could be damaged, particularly in lextérieur. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we stuck and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We did not have the right to touch the scissors to not get hurt inadvertently. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It means real skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario gave me pleasure when I congratulated him for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The competence of which I am is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we have learned during the second weekend </seg>
<seg id="178"> I am increasingly beginning to understand that styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The need for speed The Run competes across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without problem is because of a series of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine early morning shift at work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each, but it is pointless if nobody wants to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new party subtitled The Run has produced great expectations before his exit. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with a series of race Need for Speed and out a kind of game from the jouables parties that would not only with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were therefore curious how will be added to the passages in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> These are potentially racing games arcades, but the whole shoot down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has characters and to resolve to participate in illegal races across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> The result is that each race is on a different route and stages in different environments that differ quite well and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player did not feel one moment that the game is proposing something similar. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are quite nice, even if the technical level graphic is of the same type as the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally, this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm that you diminish significantly visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains you must be careful to ensure that an avalanche you do not fall over. </seg>
<seg id="202"> The different races are structured behind the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There was only a small number, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are moments you surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the clock) and then you yet another duel with an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time you have the police who enters the game and who is trying to make the situation difficult. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty is the crossings outside the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack escaped before someone and you have to help by banging on the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than what you expect (to be practical there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> The result is that because this is not likely to hinder and, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model is in the tradition of previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but we cannot say that this is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> With regard to the realistic simulation you have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But although you can find better in the conccurrence the pattern of conduct goes very well with the type of design of the races. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So everything is OK. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems begin to appear after some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The diffférence model is not yet at the point. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We do not expect this game complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how is your car, this is not completely right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During the tight exceedances sometimes you touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in mad acrobatics. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or crumbs. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system of recovery that is not really a problem, but it really upsets. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The recovery is so that when you have broken or you are left in the stage the game takes you back at the time of the last point on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you have only five redémarrages. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you used the 5 redémarrages you have to start the game from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is a tool, if something is not happening as it is, that old adage on which you can really count. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes the redémarrages do not help, and we need to find a solution in remémorrant memory piece of route. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The big problem of this game is that the same actions are in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example, there are subtle shifts that we need to move from a certain way otherwise it does not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you have on a given place &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles still in the same configuration as you first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Angry situations when you see easily move your opponent between two cars oncoming and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and conturner or halt. </seg>
<seg id="231"> If you go out to him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; in such a way that the situation is still very close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents still have other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same adversary that precedes the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This irritates the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must go before you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When he goes before you hide the sight of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you get a good number of times. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a pity, because through a simple model of the game is interesting and places with so much that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And that is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of being bored or something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change of car racing. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must be careful with gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars, though most of the time you enough. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Sports cars are ideal for cities, gas-guzzlers for straight highways and super sports cars in exotic garb on the highly technical lines on the winding roads in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And the challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime in history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> You get not only medals but also experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure. </seg>
<seg id="246"> When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects are starting to be unlocked: </seg>
<seg id="247"> It goes online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and you have other functions in the community. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the most difficult shots to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure. </seg>
<seg id="249"> You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (sounds like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it is). </seg>
<seg id="250"> Your speedometer is between 150 and 200 kilometers per hour (a priori) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In the preparation we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone has really looked at the creation of this game or whether the authors we really take for fools. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not dead, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What is annoying is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases tragically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is nothing. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The noise is good and the runway is the choice. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to please the greatest number and particularly to the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style &quot;I blend,&quot; but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> General impression of Need for Speed: the Run is really confused. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game didn&apos;t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But this game gives the impression of not being finished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The amusement is really well but prepare you for the mistakes you pat in the eye with the force of an aerodrome reflector. </seg>

<seg id="276"> Vicenova, Ambassador EU: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I do not expect a harsh war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will be 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players get used to their new role,&quot; as Vicenova Miléna began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador near the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="281"> When she was able to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University might envy, she has shown how it takes its motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe&quot; very seriously. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Ms. Vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;From the outset echoed the criticism that it is bland, that it is a rond-de-cuir, that he cannot rempplir any mission and I have to say that he has cut the breath to everyone because he holds his role to perfection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;It is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> She explained the new post of High Representative for foreign affairs and defence policy within the framework of an answer to the question: &quot;Who is the European Union?&quot; to which telephone number should I call? ,&quot; so as an important step towards unity and greater transparency of the policy of the EU states, such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked very strong) </seg>
<seg id="287"> Ms. Vicenova also lived, live and will live in a time near the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="288"> She called the Czech presidency two years of success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czech have resolved the crisis, the gas crisis or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She described the collapse of the government very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of Ambassador, &quot;beat&quot; not only for the presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> We must approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> As it would appear that the budget will be thin and economies, what branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the least, everything has to be resolved within the framework of future negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Ambassador recalled its slogans with which it arrived in Brussels &quot;for a Europe understandable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I definitely don&apos;t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As must understand the citizen that it is true that in Brussels nobody gherkins rings or twisted, differemment large bananas or that nobody has banned syrecky.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="298"> It wants to better use the environment of the EU and see more Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> A multi-speed Europe ahead </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who do not see things in their negative aspect more than positively. </seg>
<seg id="301"> It is sorry to see a small Czech representation in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to a Czech presidency success then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, when they come to me the Poles, the Magyar, Slovak, French told me: &apos; Hey, what do you do there, what is still the Visegrad?&quot; and it is not at all happy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future there are new tough rules on fiscal policy facing the member countries. </seg>
<seg id="306"> This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed, which prevails rather than a &quot;new European Federation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area, we have also the institute for enhanced cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> First it was said that cooperation among the countries who want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a Europe really at two speeds,&quot; expects Mrs. Vicenova. </seg>
<seg id="311"> From this point of view it has also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be debated between all members of the EU and not just the memebres of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Story of a mark: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone had to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be &quot;the long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm considered very current and yet since its inception it has passed 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long-term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its slogan &quot;PENSE&apos;!&quot; has become the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> IBM means a long-term thinking of continuing movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived 100 years thanks to the fact that it still remained true to its core values and has not been afraid to change all the others around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more &quot; délaré for the anniversary of the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A well-prepared system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with its employees as Bata Czech Republic - people from IBM were the only one of the first American to have paid vacations, employer-paid more uniform elegant employee and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> IBM has a system of relationships with the client well developed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was initially inspired by the discovery of talent - as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> IBM has been working for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is the so-called jamy, brain - online discussion from many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500,000 people who work. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is the internal and external image of the company to ensure a secure position in the business areas. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,&quot; said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the School of Economics at Harvard and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technlogique firm, but a firm that helps to solve problems in the world of business by using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Big Blue,&quot; as it is called colloquially in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services at the level of server products to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his discoveries such as the distributor of banknotes, the payment card, the financial swap, the code bar or the disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM rose this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it was Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview in advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> These are not all the innovations and fabrications that have had customer preference and then - IBM for example failed bet on an operational system OS/2, Prodige service online or IBM PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you can&apos;t émotionellement remain hooked on the past,&quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike Microsoft conccurent, which is and remains under the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Yet in 1990 it was with the motié of the highest representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of technology prospects. </seg>
<seg id="351"> It continues investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is negotiating with the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It is now that IBM is the current crisis without being worried? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The price of IBM progessé from 2008 to 120%, the net profit of the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything, but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> We can expect that this giant flexible control of other crises. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM&apos;s history: from slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="358"> IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a century ago; it was originally the complicated name of Tabulating Computing Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis of the future IBM has been the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80 year nineteenth. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They had technologies such as the old &quot;pointeuses,&quot; which recorded the arrival and departure of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Council of Surveillance of society. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The leader then presented the shadows to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are so far the identity and culture of society. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the firm kusqu&apos; in 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - seed cutters of cheese and meat until the cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years in which Watson led, the turnover was multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership is his son who served as the director, Thomas J Watson. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s people and computers of IBM helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classic PC that determined the standard computer with the IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM sells its computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with a high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that succeeds in IBM over the past three years - is the concept Smarter Planet &quot;a smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its goal is the uilisation smart technology in untapped areas such as transportation and management of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In terms of trade IBM has developed a platform &quot;Smarter Trade&quot; that helps business manage the business cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history on our territory. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It set up its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, in addition to IBM, there is also the strategic centre since Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The Central for the Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague, and there is also the team of research and development of the global recognition of the floor. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is over! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up her pink dream and return to the house. </seg>
<seg id="385"> It has not been able to wait and set clear rules for the future life. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepa can go back to the house, but not as my partner,&quot; explained Rychtarova. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Rychtarova Darina gave asylum to Bartosova in her house, she had not realised that the couple would not. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move Ricany, Pepa not dismissed the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> And he admitted in public that he loved. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With the time Darina has resigned, has accepted the link of her husband and has come to say goodbye forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If Rychtar and Bartosova there will be no wife to greet him on the door of the house. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;It is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will be outside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;It will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,&quot; has leaked Rychtarova by showing that she was detached from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I respect the decision of my wife.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I will stay with Iveta and do not change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="399"> &quot;The company continues, I deal with the repairs, the garden, real estate, I buy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="400"> &quot;With Darina are completely normal, but we do not set down together,&quot; said Rychtar Blesk. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If Rychtarova finds a new love will not prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;We do not set down together, and it does not want to know where it goes, with whom and whether it has a link. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I know that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take my responsibility,&quot; said Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to determine typical vices of women, all, like the others, are able to get out of their game.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear lady, you will know in the following lines of female vices arriving to pump blood from the veins of men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Should you buy at least one garment per week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are happy to buy and packages at the time of the balances? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case you can talk about shopping as a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women believe that they should restrict their passion to make purchases. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you say, which could stand at the window shop for clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And although most women buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Remind you just how many times have you told your spouse that he expected... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too big?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make sport?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;I like?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These phrases do not tell you something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Therefore, you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> This is not the question that you should stop dealing with yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints is growing and more women become empoisonnantes. </seg>
<seg id="425"> FEBEA&apos;s and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is like an endless circus. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Wash the windows, vacuuming, cleaning up the soil, dust, strip the bathroom - and twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You make remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, children that they have sullied the sink, encrassé window in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> If you have precisely this obsession, try to have in mind that we should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This harmless desire for cleanliness can spoil your relationship and family peace. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The work of undermining </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;This spent tracksuit to the dustbin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You put these old socks again tomorrow?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;A wet towel has nothing to do with earth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you are on your partner undermines this several times a day, you will really break down. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It is obvious that you do not think bad you want everything to be perfect. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps if the men knew, women would not be undermined... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Defamation, the persiflage </seg>
<seg id="439"> Defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone of some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are particularly relations and thus are happy to address topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps each of us escape a small harmless persiflage here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The heart it is a peculiarity of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise others and for them - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory of Philadelphia during Monday&apos;s NHL game on the ice of Caroline and is once again leading Czech productive players for the competition. </seg>
<seg id="446"> From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has yet made a pass and was named the best player of the game, he has scored in both cases. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr also scored two goals during the match. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr after the match told reporters Mr. Zavadzki that he had warned Giroux&apos;s that it would be a great evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;I told him before the match that he would give his has provided trick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I have felt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes this sense you fall on it,&quot; said Jagr after Giroux was a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the goals at Hurricanes and striker Maxime Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> In Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr had three goals, then Wayne Simmonds made a fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love playing with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I don&apos;t want to say that he is the best player in the league, but it really is one of the three best,&quot; said Jagr about its centre. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I had never thought that I jouerais at the end of his career with a hokeyjiste like him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am really happy with it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play on him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All these years in the NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it&apos;s my turn,&quot; said Jagr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Caroline did a drama of this game with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer on a penalty shot ends with a difference of one goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended two to one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He got at, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage. </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to hit and I was there,&quot; describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender Montreal&apos;s Jaroslav Spacek has not finished the game with Buffalo he walked in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens did not take an experienced defender ahead of two butset lost after a penalty kick shot by 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is the fact that the rear line was ill especially debt the local coach rather than points lost because they played the game only with five defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;It is zero.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We have played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing to do, it is like that,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacing it was not enough and we were not able to resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had just to simplify the game, moving at outside of our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> For this we had limits,&quot; said one of the defenders P. K. Subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the 30th attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Five different shooters have been uax goals for the Jets, who have arrested a series of five matches lost. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have changed the price of travel since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only five travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies at the time of travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the West were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists were travelling for the holiday in Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a penchant for the West and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialist era was that it nétait not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In cases where the Tchécoslovaque citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union had a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West must also be queuing all night with a sleeping bag or have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after that it was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the currency was the condition for travel to the West was denied the &quot;politically incorrect&quot; people who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, shared and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the consent of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czechs were the more frequently their holidays in the country where there were so many campaign houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and usually lasts until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The journeys of the Czechs have since seen since 1989 a major revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although until 1989 holidays in Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox that we did not realise today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to move freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits short mainly in Austria in Vienna and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could not long fly to the West that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris the travel organisations were sleeping the Czechs in tents in parks because our income could not pay the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was at this time to take away its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has enabled our tourists finally after dozens of years to be able to freely buy the Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased what has caused around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with charter air links through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world who later facilitated our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of tourism after the revolution, when prepared the first charter flight to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as every year Air Carriers&apos; direct visit Czech tourists in distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> An interesting moment in this period that symbolises our revolution happened in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008 the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to move completely in the group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15,000 kronor per person for holidays abroad including incidentals kronor per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President, but this is likely to be completed by an unresolved situation &quot;by&quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> 5mois already Czech football is without President and the risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly scheduled Thursday at Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> However, there is still no agreement on how to vote. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Rajchl Jindrich, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned in June and his departure has called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek football is back to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This has fully demonstrated on 16 September when he had to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiations are blocked and it has not even been discussed to address how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives, or officials with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this moment with the assistance of the Office for the state and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The differences still persist about the rules for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its extraordinary or planned negotiations, has brought nothing to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> Views on the voting possibilit? have changed several times, but the key point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order not to fall into the by. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model,&quot; noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the model predicted gains in the third round of the candidates who have received the most votes in proportion to the chamber for which he is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is ready to withdraw so that wins the candidate who receives the largest percentage of votes of the two chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds, and it would completely reject the bicameral concept,&quot; admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who would be better not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agree, even if he believes that the settlement of elections established under the statute Pelta advantage among all candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I hope that we vote at the maximum, according to the statutes of the association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that there is not yet insane ideas dreamt up by a representative during the past General Assemblies,&quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen candidate for the first time and in its submissions was defined primarily against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> He said Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The qualification possible today in European Championships should calm everybody.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will again on a wave of happiness and there is one more way for cooperation,&quot; added the Jablonec officer who among the three was the greatest experience in professional football at the regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends to change the regulations to design.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This can cause a blockage in the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope that good reason will win,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some réuunions should be held directly in Montenegro, but who can say whether the direction of football will be complete for the game. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special charter flight which had to travel up to Podgorice including the Vice-Presidents Kucera and Rajchl Dalibor, did not take off for technical reasons and sought a variant to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At the end is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties within the sports association the highest in the country and bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there are many: a state allocation, the credibility of football and the General Assembly of the Czech Union Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik will fight for the post of president because he sees no good candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly, whose profile would have responded to everything that it calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be campaigning for this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I am not present at the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate,&quot; said Paclik in the Czech press Agency (TKC). </seg>
<seg id="552"> The motivation for Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Rajchl Jindrich to just try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT that initially would be given a favorite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik stressed that if he won the next election would be held only until 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> He would see an experienced manager and a high level, but who is not connected with the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I talked with people who would have the profile,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was terrible when some people told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change this image,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What, they say, especially annoying Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, the controversial reputation, which is known in the wings as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of the delegates &quot; the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-powered trader, it would be even less favourable to football,&quot; declared Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What offends still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced it a few years during wiretaps in the context of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta has emerged without any penalty. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what Pelta prestige would bring football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we be viewed in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes president, I sell the club of Plzen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> If Paclik would win the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;It has great capability&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;It would be able to present himself as head of the representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as a manager of the Association he would not be able.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose in what I do not know,&quot; said Paclik, who in September has attracted much attention when he called for the annulment of the Commission of referees with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik says that he would be at the level to lead the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support in May his triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I freinerais the influence of some interested groups that tend to affect the Disciplinary Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; said Paclik chache not his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power of lobbies would get for sport more money from the tax on games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key points that the new President should address.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where will the money,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not take its current connection with the club of Plzen as something negative, even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above the parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> I see no reason to convey my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half,&quot; said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT, which should put an end to situations by. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The Jablonec official is before the meeting on Thursday at Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election of September has not carried out correctly has promised to devote themselves to national representation and obtaining money if he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He is determined to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly has passed and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present in a broad context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels of football for a long time and wait until Thursday there is a President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that this is the best time for somebody to the leadership of the Association,&quot; he said, but it is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, has worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> It is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in lépoque of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately&quot; assembled in June have undergone that were not perfect as everyone realized. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a president since September,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become president, I take as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in cases where it does not work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; added Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said previously that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes his training in law and that he knows full well that his opponent - candidate would be his first Vice-President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He has not attacked long Tonas Paclik who instead does not stop criticizing Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It evolves in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were not the most honourable and surprised many people in the course of the campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;It is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; said Pelta at the address of his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations that he made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football competitions at the lowest level up to the national réprésentation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a football vitirne. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I also endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with Bohémians or the result of the scandal of corruption.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I entrerais immediately in negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football,&quot; said the Czech news agency CTK reported the fifty-sixth candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also added that his appointment as head of football would not change. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should be acquainted with all employees,&quot; he said in Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will be able to overcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and it will only be when there will be at its head a new leader,&quot; as stated optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot;If the current Vice-President Rajchl Jindrich is elected new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday that course would not please many people, it seems. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, however, that if it is elected we will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He has promised to settle the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to make football more money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As president I want to play football in its entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful football for youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I am not saying that I will do all this alone,&quot; said Rajchl in an interview for TKC. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members of a particular area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will hand out difficult missions for the football against a big step forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;A lot of people are not happy because it will begin to work hard rather than criticising others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> He said that he would not run as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;To me, we know that I am working 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know if this is true and if I have people behind me who will constantly sticks in the wheels and emit doubts about each of my actions,&quot; explaining why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;A lot of people have said that I do not have to give up because they also refuse.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;A confidence that I cannot betray,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates them, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Since these last two years there has been a lot of work done and I don&apos;t want to let them down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stops.&quot; he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic work and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not know.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;You can say a number of things, but certainly not to support someone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I am trying to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms once again that it would be only a President for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is the time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian whose victors would first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;There would be no situation like now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is now to find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I sense an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber has elected its Vice President and knows that with me there will be success,&quot; said Rajchl, who is considering its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating contracts with television and on the law on the games. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He said instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault at all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he said about Pelta &quot;that he was disqualified because the Czech footblal would lose its credibility,&quot; he believes that the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate who has to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can doubt Plzen that he has done this year a superb job.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If he was elected, he would surely in what has been started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;It would not spoil its success,&quot; said Rajchl, who has assessed his rivals. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Europe&apos;s finest swimming pools </seg>
<seg id="648"> A leap in the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Wading pools of UFO, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and turned the city or a long walk - can leave her tired legs in soft-drink baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows in which swimming pool can experience the most well-being. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder went into research trip during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his baggage: his swimsuit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back in the water, she retorted cupolas artistically arranged, and swimming against the marbles Putten expected from the other side of the pool and failed to admire Art Nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If a covered swimming pool was fun, she noted in her book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and presented in his book already published: &quot;Badefreuden (Joies Bain.&quot; municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palace bloodbath in the woods, &quot;concrete buildings Hardcore&quot; in the Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> She has led her &quot;trips to the most outstanding baths of Central Europe&quot; in 13 countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The German 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Meder, explains that it is not a great deal of interest in sport but Yukon feels attracted to water in a completely different way. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It is irritating that swimming fans should simply look blue tiles and cope with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe perfume relatively stable populations of spruce forests or can listen to the joyous trill of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly,&quot; said the Viennese. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started a collection of beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of the water doubly reinforces the architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of wellbeing in the swimming rooms are enormous because all the senses are awake, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builders would be given a little more room to swim could be a real delight for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor surface water in the swimming rooms.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;It is transparent, but reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The volume of image of small &quot;Badefreuden&quot; is a report worth 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historic welfare - he certainly want to make a leap into the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The Meder collector has discovered remarkable copies during his research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Alongside welfare splendid baths as the Szechenyi bath aged 100 years ago in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing in a natural cave in the Karst cave in Miskolc - Tapolca) as well as a bath baths whose basins are filled with water containing alcali (and Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building in the form of a bottle. </seg>
<seg id="670"> By contrast, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a bath house in Zurich was the entire city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St Anton: the Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe animation on the ski hill. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the most extraordinary design of swimming pool awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: the Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles a UFO that has just landed on the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> In winter, steam rises from the three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal into the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Algesiras in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> The smell of bleach does not come from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths are a smell of sulphur, Árpád spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, that it is hard to believe, to find themselves in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell is coming from the alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and silt you stuck to the skin as soon as you let slip into the pool - a special spa experience. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During his quest of the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder has also suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded area. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath designed by the Du?an architèque Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> A glance through the window of the building - Art Nouveau in red, white and yellow, she has observed the development of weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> She has observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Baths of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only elements New Roman leaving since its conception in 1844 but still a Moorish Alhambra style room was added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace spa remains the favorite bath pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because she is a native of Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It is already a beautiful performance that if different styles of building a formidable unit,&quot; said Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace, diving in the pool is apparently only a minor issue. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agricultural speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials </seg>
<seg id="687"> Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> The German bank abandons its speculation on raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that the banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann highlighted in this article that speculation on raw materials, pushing prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity in the global famine. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that the gamblers have posted offers and demand - and benefit very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann responded to the criticism of American competitors differently: he promised to investigate the accusations and said, &quot;nothing is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to Spiegel Online, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented with a recommendation, usually. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> It could be a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann built its Image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Speculation on rising food prices shows a particularly drastic, how banks today are detrimental to the general interest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank must remove all of its portfolio investments, for which money has been spent on food speculation,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It is important for Mr. Ackermann, if it is a question of starving people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The awareness of Ackermann at first glance may seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group would like to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Deutsche Bank did announce on Monday that the President of the Council of Administration will not change what is planned within the Council of Administration. </seg>
<seg id="712"> It could improve its brand with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And about possible losses, it has little to worry about - his successor will be. </seg>
<seg id="714"> One in two would terminate investments on raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has conducted surveys among 1,001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many of the bank&apos;s customers would also personal consequences if they were told that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43% déconseilleraient of such a bank in their entourage, 49% said they think about the termination of their account to change banking institution. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21st house in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion, which moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is once again open and exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its glass hangars, its bright and bold and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for Expo in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Schwanzer Pavilion was once the &quot;great Architecture Prize&quot; for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Construction is seen until today as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He has made so famous architects, that he has also built the Pavilion for Expo. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at the international level in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the World Exposition in the Garden at the railway station in the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to display the works of art, not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However, it has been so long that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and has become increasingly dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of &quot;home of the 21st century&quot; and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, in which the house is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new start was carried out by Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein - Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth skater, subsequently at Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, she has led to particularly well the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, it has received public funds and private sponsorship and exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation is the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookshop, and an office should be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht, and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the flag was &quot;an extremely important place&quot; where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and his change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was &quot;an abyss,&quot; says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of windows of glass facades were changed, glass insulation reinforced fibreglass was raised and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of subdued light between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the slight Schwanzer Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The outer doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a colour protection against rust red-brown color. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the movie theatre is even identical to what it once was. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and which also appealed to the Office of the monuments,&quot; said Krischanitz, and it draws attention to a crude soil underground. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot;which originated in Brussels,&quot; said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of &quot;Drop-in-the-City.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and is still &quot;awaken the conscience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the &quot;area of Central Station&quot; newly planned, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck might happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the addition of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berlin&apos;s temporary art centre, and as it is said, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Bahn is planning a winter package crisis. </seg>
<seg id="758"> The company of the railways has developed a plan - crisis, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The number of employees is expected to double. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; will spend more than 70 million more this year. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The daily Bild Zeitung reported earlier, citing an internal crisis in the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015. </seg>
<seg id="763"> This should allow greater availability of vehicles and the rail network in the event of extreme weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks is expected to double between 16,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The aim is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90% of the equipment needed to service within a period of four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> There are two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter the railways had a lot of problems for transport users, because it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> So many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the Ministry of Railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The railway company has for years what to do, given that it needs to check the axles of trains ICE much more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on ICE in the central railway station in Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the case of the chief Josef Ackermann of the new US: the German bank Deutsche Bank &quot; must pay a fine amounting to millions. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant sector caught up in the US: the institute in Frankfurt pays compared 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It is the sale of mortgage documents. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to the big banks a series of charges, and encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to be able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiate a procedure in court,&quot; said a spokesman of the Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank has acknowledged no fault comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This applies also to Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of an amount of $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The president of NCUA Debbie Matz has welcomed the concessions of the two banks. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of customers. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to repair the damage of several billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Comparisons now are the first of their kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator has also taken other major banks and he summoned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> With regard to the issue of mortgage documents &quot;Mortgage Securities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="786"> Credit institutions are at the base. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the housing bubble US erupted in 2007, it was fatal for a large number of banking companies. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Even if the events are already a few years ago, at the moment it is blowing on the US banks a wind storm. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain compensation or to punish breaches. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="792"> It accuses 18 major international banks, two financial house US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &quot; benefit in kind in mortgages of about 200 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, several operations of a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="794"> The supervisory authorities are demanding that the Frankfurter addresses &quot;substantial losses&quot; but without mentioning a specific sum. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Warren Buffett is growing by 10 billion IBM </seg>
<seg id="797"> Buffett, the guru of finance, has invested huge sums in IBM&apos;s IT company. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Since March, he has bought shares worth more than 10 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="799"> So far the largest American investor Warren Buffett says repeatedly not to invest in IT computer companies, given that the long-term evolution of societies reveal that bad prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="800"> However, he read the reports from IBM and has changed his opinion on the investment in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes mainly benefits of services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as an attack in the world of finance. </seg>
<seg id="803"> IT IBM gives itself the right to call &quot;Mr IBM.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="804"> Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue, that it has bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="805"> His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Buffett said that IBM has never heard anything of this commitment so far. </seg>
<seg id="807"> He congratulated the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;You have done a great job,&quot; said Buffett strategically. </seg>
<seg id="809"> IBM for some time on the lucrative services IT as a &quot; exploitation of accounting centres. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The pioneer of computer science, old more than 100 years, offers both Software and consulting business calculators very efficient. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett had hitherto rather avoided technology companies. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He says that he only invests in companies that he understands the business. </seg>
<seg id="813"> But instead Buffett tackles over rail cargo, manufacturers of lubricants and machinery. </seg>
<seg id="814"> His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The 80-year-old 81 years had resumed in the 1960s &quot; the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and had built one of the most prestigious global enterprises, thanks to smart investments. </seg>
<seg id="816"> But his lifestyle is modest. </seg>
<seg id="817"> That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of the Buffett investment IBM shares have risen by one percent on the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue,&quot; as is also known as IBM, has a market capitalization of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> For Microsoft, Buffett, he does not want to participate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is palpable </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickauer cell&quot; the Turkish media are skeptical of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology,&quot; renaîtrait now. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many German-Turkish spectrum believed dead for a long time: since the Mölln arson attacks in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been violence comparable with the right-wing extremist backdrop against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> There is in Germany, it has never been discussed. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals that the dimension is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Is it a return to the bloody ideology,&quot; &quot;that was the title of the publication on the Internet in the Turkish newspaper&quot; Haberturk .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &apos;Sabah&apos; points out that one of the authors would have been a man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is calmly responded the Turkish community in Germany: it has called this weekend for a silent commemoration for the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> It is only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought at a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the agreement of German-Turkish recruitment. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The reports of some Turkish media are a slap: &quot;The gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary&quot; that is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - &quot;Haber X,&quot; which refers to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The German release of &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not deprive clear conditions. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It starts at puer,&quot; this is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It points out that people have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The action of the police has been seen very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they subsequently discussed the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it has not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities searches in some suspicious right-wing circles, surprised the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than one is prepared at least rhetorical or drastic ways: &quot;If the case continues to be botched, there will be nothing other than self-defense and weapons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;It will be the best self-defense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,&quot; wrote &quot;Selen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="845"> What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have clearly explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The picture of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the past it was the failure of German policy after the attacks, the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish state, has been represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how much taxes produced the local population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of their tax burdens. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media report demonstrates once again how the distrust of many of Klempp Turks is deep in the state of local law since that date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of the far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is this time. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal of Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS has almost collapsed in the financial crisis and in the meantime patina of a crisis. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is a German who must now lead. </seg>
<seg id="859"> It is certainly not what Axel Weber was imagined. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July that it would be in 2013 a position almost as spectacular: President of the Council of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and kind comments on future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;UBS has succeeded the Turnaround.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> And yet, from the month of September, it was clear that everything was going to change. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A UBS securities dealer in London diverted all security systems of the Bank and had approximately 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The Chairman of the board of directors of UBS is seen as suffering - and all asking: when Axel Weber is it finally? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the presidency in May - not in 2013, as provided by the bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber it becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, much more Professor d &quot; economy and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed a period of adjustment. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly he is assuming responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of &quot;the biggest bank scandal in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is a huge part - until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years of a scandal. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is the proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss manager of assets, silent and sound, but also clever, it had combined with ambitious goals: it wanted to also become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, it was advanced as a bank of investment in the league of the largest banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made sense. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: &quot;I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;In the current context, one wonders: how is it that I could simply be mistaken at this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It is profoundly wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something amiss at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was considered previously as a senior intellectual as well as a brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had soared with sub-prime documents and a cross on billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this reason it has indeed found investors, but that little time before, would have furrowed eyebrows: a transparent bottom of Asian state from Singapore and an Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> It was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank was to announce losses worth billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS, given its investment errors in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which she could become co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Switzerland has been shaken - because it noted how it can be dramatic for a small country, so big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We have not been able to save UBS again,&quot; said the bank researcher, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster was followed by the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and is ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the tax authorities, perhaps with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, it has accepted a payment of 780 million dollars in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine. </seg>
<seg id="901"> UBS has more or less published that it had helped to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the removal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of client money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business lines: investment banking because of bad speculation and the management of assets because of tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would get back, he followed this unfortunate story of merchants: a single merchant is surging 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticing that something amiss. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it publishes: risk management in investment bank that does not work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the Adoboli case, it was found that the risk control too little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German bank says: &quot;The problem of UBS is that it has no control of the risks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function to become guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already, the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its seat at the railway station in Zurich, which leads directly to the railway station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are prestigious, retail rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Watchmakers like Tiffany&apos;s, midway between the Swiss traditions stores like those of the Sprüngli confectionery. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries the Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks like Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It arrives in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, walls are sheathed in marble, with thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for &quot;safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the client here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank has ruled out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, ultimately like all Swiss bankers with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS would become far too big, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are also prevalent. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss would have nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And even if they have long been adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that has changed the UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;the crash of UBS.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to 68 billion francs around 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankrupt bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How this could happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have entered into a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and has been steadily increasing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What has helped is that the two prédécesseuses banks UBS completed: a rich bank, but lethargy with strong management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the international investment banks have had access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS, Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel was a dream team,&quot; said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very good models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive, which has blazed a path to the summit with the learning of the bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would face &quot; at the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; Geiger said. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the leaders&apos; meetings during which the leader of the group Wuffli has always delivered the same watchword: displace Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It has commissioned the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which have documented the success of the banks at this time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all, UBS wanted to climb above. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already been successful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisers, who have been responsible, have pointed out, however, a weakness: in the international operations of interest in the banking jargon &quot;fixed,&quot; there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS would have shortcomings in US mortgages. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, UBS has launched an adventure, which has almost cost. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, it is also the bank itself that a fund management created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and put the documents of value based on mortgages in the US - but which has also retained risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks have long sought to get out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought here,&quot; says Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The euphoria over the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after another had to leave, when put an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions at UBS became ejection and are up to now bancaux. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Anyone who runs the large bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The bank researcher, Geiger has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not (yet) go so far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as much as it is clear now. </seg>
<seg id="966"> On Thursday the head of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Italian Swiss aged 51 years was only supposed to be temporary when the bank has surprised his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, it has imposed: it must conduct a sustainable business of UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the state of play in the middle of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What does it want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked. </seg>
<seg id="976"> He said publicly until now only that he would seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> The fear of the recession in Europe is weighing on the US stock market </seg>
<seg id="979"> The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged American investors. </seg>
<seg id="980"> The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Industrial production halted on the continent has dashed the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its midst. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The euro has fallen against the dollar. </seg>
<seg id="984"> The Greek and Italian glass I had last week only half full, not half empty - but now the problems are once again at the forefront, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Above all the financial values were on the leaves of sale. </seg>
<seg id="986"> The default values of the Dow Jones Index noted at the close of markets a loss of about 0.6% to 12.078 points. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12,170 points. </seg>

<seg id="990"> In Frankfurt, the DAX ended with a drop of 1.2% to 5985 points. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The industry in the 17 countries of the euro area has significantly reduced its production and has adjusted at the end of the recovery. </seg>
<seg id="992"> As announced by the Eurostat statistics office, companies have produced in September, 2% less than in the month before. </seg>
<seg id="993"> American investors have expressed a sceptical: &quot;We are not an island,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, did confirm this caution: &quot;Is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis,&quot; he said in an interview with CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> As a result, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead, Warren Buffett threw an old principle of several decades to wind and entered the US technology industry </seg>
<seg id="998"> Its investment of more than 10 billion dollars to IBM has supported the actions of this traditional group, and almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The paper has finished virtually unchanged at $187, 35. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Buffett claims to have paid an average of 170 dollars per room, and now holds 5.5 per cent. </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Smart crows spread in cities </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places, rooks are regarded as &quot;oiseaux° problem&quot; but experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer chasing cities for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some love, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible; crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents&apos; complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> An antidote against the &quot;°problème bird&quot; is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> During the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to hunt the rooks of cities. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Experts from across Germany deliberated on possible solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They are looking for alternatives in cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> The protectors of nature makes the problems of cities on the exodus of rooks particularly protected: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroy traditional vital spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Hunting, landscaping and tree typical eggs made life difficult for birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows are under the protection of nature. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of eggs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with cudgels particularly brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;Normal expulsion, ousting, does nothing,&quot; said city planner and landscape, Werner Klöver. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The destruction of nests using water under pressure or trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;Animals away, large colonies divide and disperse in other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> The drive is conceivable only in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We are forced to live with them, we can no longer kill them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif packaging and aggressive offers to relocate. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens tried &quot;info signs chainsaws&quot; in order to establish relations completely different: &quot;We can finally withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger journey - educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, signs advising on the lives of these highly intelligent rooks. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This project has now been adopted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: &quot;This is a lot of communication, these birds have much to say.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: the rooks are not only working tools to reach a beauty, but they manufacture their tools as instruments of work. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Éthologistes of the University of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to toppling scaffolding with stones to achieve a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much training, they recognized déterminément that a stone had to have some size and shape to sink the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second trial, clever crows had to solve a problem more chunky. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a cylinder vertically placed, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The birds could not reach their spoils with their beaks. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals were a hook with which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four rooks are even from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Cristiano Ronaldo is Portugal&apos;s championship 2012 </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The hopes of Bosnians and Turks were without success. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the championship 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have bought the remaining tickets in the playoffs for the 2012 European championship in Poland and eliminated Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Led by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal has messed up against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the game, its fifth participation in the European championship. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The Czechs have reached the return playoff match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> There was also more burning in the tie 0:0 between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland has taken a break 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other pull for Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11 metre penalty played (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) have been twice a shortcut for Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Lulic Sena was confronted by a yellow card - red (54th). </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the World Cup 2010 in South Africa in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal has had a measured start. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> Ronaldo sent a free kick from 30 metres in advance. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> A good quarter of an hour later, Nani has shown its qualities to draw distance and fired at a distance of 25 metres 2:0. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The Bosnians, who in the first half hour have not done, have had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship Manchester City launched a ball to head towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball has not crossed the goal line (33rd). </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Jiracek has drawn a goal for the Czech </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of attention. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and shown the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th). </seg>
<seg id="1065"> On the other hand, Stark gave a penalty of 11 metres played controversial after Fabio Coentrao, Misimovic has surely diverged. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> But, after the break, the runners-up of 2004 managed four shots and everything became clear. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek was also the last doubts in the 81st minute. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Thus, the European champion in 1976 will go for a fifth time. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The team of coach Michal Bilek with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (FC Nuremberg), has also been lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> Goalie Petr Cech stopped with a reflex last minute by Tomas Sivok (9th). </seg>
<seg id="1071"> Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the surface repair right beside the firing of Cech. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> After the break, the crossing has had to come to the rescue of world-class goalkeeper Czechs already shot, again, the attacker from FC Seoul had been replaced (50th). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> The short time before the end has finally clarified. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Turkey was missing the football miracle of Zagreb during this time. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks in Zagreb were not able to go beyond a 0:0. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> While the national coach Guus Hiddink has also had to abandon its place on the bench in the third of 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European championship. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost completed a dream start. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Selcuk Inan marked the seventh minute with a volley, long-range only the pole, attaqueur Kazim Kazim was even able to bury the ball into the goal. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After a moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Even after the break, the Croatians have nothing left to burn. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, which has been replaced by Ivan Perisic Dortmund 62 Minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) have remained on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Trapattoni is involved in the MS </seg>
<seg id="1084"> In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the country since 1988 in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary ruling, 32nd Minute. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) has equalised for the visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Ireland has pushed the gear from the outset, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy has received the first good opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the first striker. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> In the 32nd minute, it happened. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> After an unsuccessful defence of goalie Pavel Londak, Ward and shook the ball on the line for 1:0. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> A woman falls Tramways and wounded </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Following a fall in a tram, a woman of 52 years was fatally wounded Monday in Berlin - Lichtenberg. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: Intimate History of the First World War (&quot; beauty and grief: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that give you the heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> A council to start: carefully tear up this page and make your mark - page. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will learn to know these people in great detail. In this narrative fiction of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He wrote a book outside that he described, accurately, as &quot;a book of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It includes a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, that a &quot;book describing how this might look like.&quot; &quot; feelings, impressions, experiences and moods. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists there, doctors, paramedics and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war, some will lose members, will become crazy or lose their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives reeling here as the candles of a church: while some are suppressed, revival. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is that the terrible war trenches on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; skillfully described other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving from the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war took the lives of these people as a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina pue the cordite explosive. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When gun shots are heard in the distance, and that you are a mother at home, are you or evade you? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who will come anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, &quot;the lack of facts has been amplified by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the fleet of high seas. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small isolated moments and details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most tackle deprivation and the ability to get away. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;Ersatz, everywhere ersatz.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, bandages paper, wooden buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He goes on food replacement in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes the &quot;meat made of rice cooked in fat mutton (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco with dry roots and dried skin potato; soles of wooden shoes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> He says that &quot;837 permitted substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are 511 alternative cafes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories deal with honour and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own drive against the savagery and says about the war: &quot;You feel that, after all, this is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your empesée shirt and cloutée. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it likely to die, and that nobody will notice or pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When you are resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> It is unfortunately rather akin to &quot;a condemned man strangled in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations about the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict is becoming increasingly a story of economic competition,&quot; wrote Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species within the aviary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing, which carries out its butchery while being seated behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People act unexpectedly; there are so many basic behaviours of heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund speaks of the soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;We find the most grotesque expression in trade was due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and cover the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The most desperate eyes, which translates into a lifetime blindness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In the Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, it captures the way the war has &quot;triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are beginning to wonder why their leaders have a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books of the First World War are often indirect, such as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (the Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or &quot;nothing new,&quot; Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The book by Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most damning that I read in a fictionnelle. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I am not going. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized your hands this page listing people and burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a false start, a carefully planned operation </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation remained secret from everyone except a few senior officers as well as other informed at the outset that they would carry out an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> There could be no repetition d &quot; episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, who went against the settlement of the department and have created a storm of public sympathy for the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The operation to clean up the park Zuccotti demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The police were prepared by observing the occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A crucial exercise was held on the island of Randall, in view of the operation in the Zuccotti park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Police officers receive better training against the riots - counterterrorism measures that are to move quickly to a large number of policemen - to concentrate on the area of Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session took place on Monday evening, from the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to move into the park reached &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said one man, referring to the operation as &quot;a simple exercise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few policemen that I know and who have been called did not know they would go to the Zuccotti park,&quot; said the anonymous person. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones to know that they are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The city has managed to learn a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park, but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to neighborhoods particularly criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people would come and go in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants 1am was a favorable schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to proceed when the park had fewer people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Vehicles of the emergency services equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and recorded messages resounding loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While the community affairs officers entering the park with their wind-breaker light blue, many demonstrators have simply brought their business and political parties. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said Police, which has left time for the occupants to pool their business. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other police teams have been sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists inside the park have been forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that this measure had been taken solely by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But according to many journalists, police would be unable to observe the intervention inside the park, severely restrained by the officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that the trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the police moved westward through the thick undergrowth of demonstrators, including luggage, the plastic lawn and leaf bags of clothing, teams from the Department of Sanitation, cleaning up everything that the occupants left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp clung together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The emergency services were called to cut the locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrest has taken place in the park before three-thirty said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and fifteen minutes later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most &quot;disturbing public order and rebellion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the senior officer to be found on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the Department of detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although now, &quot;was not managing the operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of police officers patientaient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the event of intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It saw the Police widen the perimeter far beyond the Zuccotti park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Nearly 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the most serious actions of the night took place in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> At around 5 am, south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the folding of a police car; others have been seen punching tires of a police truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen in the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of school aid is suing the city for redundancies </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union representing hundreds of school aides who have lost their jobs last month plans to launch Wednesday a trial in the city for discriminatory and unnecessary redundancies, the impact is disproportionate on schools with disadvantaged schoolchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel the redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two school aid coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the less well paid in the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October last year. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have made it possible to close the budget gap in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott&apos;s Quarry said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Council has responded, stating that the redundancies of school aid were not specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The officers of the 37th District Council have said that they would notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis Walcott&apos;s quarry and the Department of Education of the city will be the defendant, the plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all black or Latin American origin, like most school aides who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and cannot comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would capitalize on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest parts of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular underfunding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and some barely in the institutions of Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts districts south of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claim that &quot;this is not an area of wealthy parents who can get funds to fill the budget gap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the public school has been reduced from 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each registration disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union contended that the directors of schools have been misled by certain words in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo was using the term &quot;surge&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;excess&quot; described more generally move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the complaints, &quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents have been made redundant,&quot; and &quot;not only because of excess.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission: Congress is an agreement on the issue of Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took a successful uprising, the capture and the death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their uprising and the American troops for their &quot;courage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions to approve or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The US mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations &quot;congratulate the Libyan people for their courage and determination for freedom&quot; and &quot;congratulates the men and women of the Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and great professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution says &quot;the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measure will win the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or divide legislators like last June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the final version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments, but it is not without having tried. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The amendment Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been presented to Congress on a wide range of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful &quot;control federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to soften their CV - the chance to boast of being &quot;the perpetrator&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in August called for the House and Senate vote on the amendment for a balanced budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates in which the members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment banning marriage between same-sex is proposed, just as the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As eager as were members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> During the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slowed from the early 1990s, when members were generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Massacred but not beaten,&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman fired at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona emerged Monday evening in a television broadcast, sang &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; on Broadway and has said it wants to recover rather than return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> During his appearance in the news &quot;20/20&quot; on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form sentences and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The issue has approached its difficult return following the ball that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the January shootings, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery &quot;difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied &quot;rather well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special one-hour edition of &quot;20/20&quot; broadcast on the eve of the release of the new couple&apos;s book entitled &quot;Gabby: a story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special issue has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shootings on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he sits on his hospital bed, his head flattened and a large scar on the front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A sign of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A movement of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, his first word: &quot;Whatever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) to ask to change the menu of his breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: there&apos;s Representative sing with doctors Cyndi Lauper &quot;Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty &quot;free Fallin&quot;? .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with doctors, said they did not remember the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, he was read an article about the shooting of 12 March when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated pending the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;There has been a lot of deaths,&quot; said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, &quot;I was beaten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I would say,&quot; Gabby, you have not been beaten, &quot; said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you&apos;ll get through, restore and come back even stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More pity than respect for the troops </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala on Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ride on impotence, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in tie is standing on its feet to cheer. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The military men and women are seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the fundraising in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer present at the gala, which was also attended Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They have been presented as a kind of orphan,&quot; wrote the top military officer in an Email. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But this was not just a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and an American public passionate but often distant. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Praise is lavished on the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not victims,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They realize that the anger of troops returners of the Vietnam War has been much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most conversations about the pity in confidence among the veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of his two sons in the battle with the Marines, Colonel retired Mark Cancian has warned that the public would see their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some people would watch with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and traveled to faraway places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others are asking whether &quot;a veteran angry and violent lies beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who talks called subtle if he would be able to keep under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you raise the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions,&quot; recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military difficulties, in part, from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Victories are rarely appreciated by a country unfamiliar with the army, which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, we no longer cherish the heroism in the same way as for the Second World War,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier of 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> C &quot; was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He was asked if he could join in his bedroom to drink a glass. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;C&quot; was a wake-up call, &quot; says Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texane has set aside its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, it was 19 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I had to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after entering the House of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed her from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and not others, will wait anxiously for the decision of justice in an historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> They are accused of failing to halt the spread of rape in the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers; they claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke says military galonnées, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals in the position d&quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> The lawyer also says that since the month of February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of bringing together all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - it will start a trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the US attorney Neil McBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries to staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense has refused to make any comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have still not, officially, the right to go to war, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, especially to enter into contact with local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: in these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two-thirds in combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> It is not alone in this battle: three other trials are underway. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At the Yale Law School, the centre of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of &quot;personality disorder&quot; assigned to the victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women&apos;s Action Network for military women), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with the requests for benefits for those who have been victims of a sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine bills independent of each other have been presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults have been recorded in the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, according to its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents this year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report published in March is also looking at the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the army have been the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke described their assault as the first of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, she informed the military of rape less than an hour after the fact. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she said, he was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She has undergone a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, a trial in which it questioned his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people have testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was made,&quot; says Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought that I was going to begin to have contractions. I am yelling at the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I have been placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember having told my commander,&quot; it was not his trial but mine. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman has been forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has come to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, it has been referred under less than honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Does the case Lyman and other complainants will or not, it is a long history, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he says, &quot;in my opinion, they should be able to move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticised the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things change only when the right have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight against the army on this issue so that there will be no reform,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;What we would, either of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: researchers study on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been made a killing in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to learn more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how do we find? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy... so log you on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that it was not so difficult to find them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is full of personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site&apos;s advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way in which the marketers are doing so for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe, it has targeted with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invite users to respond to an inquiry. The questions were asked about their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have interviewed 10,000 supporters of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;This is a new way of doing research,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young and against immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &quot;those who combine activism online and off-line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Think-tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the &quot;I love,&quot; publications on the walls and updated statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add content per day on average, the &quot;data we call supernovae&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research that the name of the site appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not walk in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you try to carry out investigations into the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You have to go to the party, but they have never allowed to enter,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and treat health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits while intoxicated had a lot more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help possibly a student whose status would speak too often. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can&apos;t deal with a problem if you do not diagnostiquez,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, coauthor of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, behaviour and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and in another case not recognized.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly accessing information from its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The site team has studied the statistics concerning the situation lover and the day of Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the midterm elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the only available information - the champions of the digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But users of Facebook know that the site that they like or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to have access to your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when users of Facebook are part of an investigation that they have not even heard? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn&apos;s, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, according to a study in 2006 that he has been looking at the Facebook walls of his students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say about Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn&apos;s believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing can replace the real world and contact with the people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not in front of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhumane&quot;: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has admitted having organised the two attacks that have been 77 deaths in Norway this summer, was described as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter during his first appearance at the trial which is taking place in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temple of Norway,&quot; he says before a courtroom full of 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject, because your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he &quot;didn&apos;t want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he has refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Judge Nesheim has also asked the Police Breivik detain 12 weeks, he was forbidden to talk to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Thirty relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in their eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I have found cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;I was not comfortable, but I have a little advanced after having seen and heard the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, he looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eye by entering and leaving the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the bizarre idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of &quot;resistance,&quot; the judge has determined that he was not crazy; he also said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, resulting in criticism - absolutely not perhaps some. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a parent of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Seven lessons from the interview lost Steve Jobs, the film this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - characterised by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recovered recently and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It had a hippie, but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a ameliorative charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a &quot;disease suggesting that a brilliant idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a brilliant idea for a product of exception.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds.&quot; This series chronicles the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says that the main copies have been lost in transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly bulging, is the basis of the 68 minutes film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known to hate depth-interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where he seems anxious to hear the issues of Cringely, giving him shots of elbow to speed up and move to questions or issues of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient about Lost Interview: Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other businesses and expressed its own vision on the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something inspiring about the man that we see here, the anxiety dreamer on the eve of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He said then. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the way in which he has learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During all these years, I have always asked:&quot; why are you doing things? &quot;And the answers are always the same: &apos; Oh, just because we need to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why, no one is thinking about deep things in a company. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs is giving details on its efforts to simplify accounting for Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Puzzled as to how the costs were recorded - it often begins with a &quot;standard cost&quot; assessed to nose, then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; - he has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> The opportunity to play a round on the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;blue box&quot; that he has created with Steve others - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and call free long distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device has been the subject of many written beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and others have tested the box using a public telephone, and then connecting from one network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We enveloppions the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you arrived a minute later to the public telephone,&quot; said Jobs, chuckling. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and thanks to the Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We do not know much, but we have managed to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things; it was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful round that he and others have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by impersonating Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> His love with technology (and Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, the hunt for spare parts to produce a fréquencemètre, he wants the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and a quick phone call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This has had a remarkable influence on me,&quot; was the only company that I had seen at this stage and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of the employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he found the &quot;first ever desktop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase, had a small CRT. I fell in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The teenager was returned at HP and began to write programs for this machine. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Improvisation of innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a head. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell a few circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working at only 30 days of credit, he must deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember big disputes... I yelled above arguing that it would take five years to produce a mouse that would cost $300] I have had enough, I went out and went to see a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to make $15, which was incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Large companies that burn out: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;If you work for IBM or Xerox, you better copier or printer, and after&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can evolve, so it is these types of people who end up leading companies and staff are put to the gap in decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by those who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This is what happened at Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold all the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could have done ten times its current size, Xerox would have been the Microsoft in the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have snatched defeat to victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A huge amount of manual work between a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot about its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are compromises to do... some things that you can&apos;t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories, too. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste; it is to try to explain the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product that you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy and that the great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have always been ashamed to steal good ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional: the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, who were simply the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Except for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas provided with opponents of the health law when the court meets </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to examine the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama&apos;s health will be heard, two of its judges, Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been spotted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the High Court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the reform of health care ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental 5h30 argument is expected in March, and the result will probably contribute to the destabilisation of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at a time when the court&apos;s decision will be made. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer before the court and argued on the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who has served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The legal firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of the two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Fédéraliste Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court&apos;s conference on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> There is, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican of the Senate and opponent of the health law. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The star invited to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Fédéraliste Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they probably argumenteraient by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: &quot;A judge can attend fund-raising organizations linked to the law and that the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the agenda of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two lawyers in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court should respect the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were drinking and were having dinner and a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their participation in the fundraising of this event dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist profile. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been brought to the level of the Court of First Instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pressed for Kagan recused to hear the case, saying that it had too much invested in the defence of the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has given no indication that it would do so. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing has a record order of 18 billion dollars for aircraft </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 passenger aircraft, with the opportunity to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> This is a case where the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had reached the record sum of 18 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally incredible is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2,520 planes for a total value of $450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the order of commercial aircraft the most expensive of its history - 50 Boeing 777 corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that has spent this gargantuan order. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced at the Salon Aerospace in Dubai in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would increase the total amount of the order to $26 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, called Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six devices more than a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;These clients in particular have an immense value.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have a lot of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> They have therefore not only the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their most important costs - would be less harmful because the country would gain money with the rise in oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the oil price rises, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural hedge,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing wide-body aircraft and helps to curb the encroachment of the Airbus competitor with his plane A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing in aerospace show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777 - 300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus postpones its inception to increase the surge in demand from its customers to increase its capacity and autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The actions of the Boeing Company rose 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the election of Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Maria Luisa Calderon says that the drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the post of governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost his attempt to access to the post of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that the drug traffickers have helped his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo Institutional Revolutionary, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of governor of the state of the west. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they stole ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have forced people to vote&quot; for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years to lose the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But he organises his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo appears to be outspoken Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the Party National Action, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential left divided and unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles has also refused to recognize the early results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any connection with the drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialising in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However, violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before the elections the PAN mayor was murdered while he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned the campaign by fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, for the PRI as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help the party in its momentum. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, &quot;I think that this victory is very encouraging for next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> LADS urges Asia to help the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, the Director General of LADS based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing in the world should &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a &quot;indifferent eye&quot; and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside leaders and resources of Europe would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore anyone can help Europe to emerge from the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the Economic Forum World in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected&quot; at some point, but it is not immune. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that nothing prevents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> In recent months, the euro area has been severely shaken by a crisis of sovereign debt. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian dangerously soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has spurred the fear that the global economy falls into recession, and prompted the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag has hopes that the IMF would provide any assistance, but he has also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the obligations of the financial rescue funds from the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater power in negotiations with the Asian partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that &quot;India will do everything it can&quot; to help the eurozone since its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a decline in arrivals of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the eurozone remains unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich when they face their own major economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, has said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid from Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, has also asked why the reserves of India should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone could cause &quot;significant repercussions&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Forecasts of LADS economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &quot;the risk of loss&quot; because of the European threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed &quot;develop&quot; contingency plans &quot; to protect themselves from an economic downturn and massive leakage of capital. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Severe warnings from the Pentagon about the potential cuts in defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has upped the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a chain reaction financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, from gatherings of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts is imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R- Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R- South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, would lead to 23% of reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A significant reduction, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and our unfeasible construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other efforts to modernize,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also have to separate a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians leave without pay in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously alter our preparation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts would affect possibly troops, continues Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although funding in wartime contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets,&quot; said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The contractor would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff managing salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The result of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline in the US as the world&apos;s undisputed leader of the military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are fiercely opposed to this drastic action,&quot; said the senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one that we should impose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The letter from Panetta and the recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even if he succeeded himself at the highest position in the Pentagon with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might occur - a military with a shell, but no core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,&quot; said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, it invites aggression. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined specifically how new reductions could &quot;generate significant operational risks: deadline for responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk unacceptable in future combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The list included the Fighter F-35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new gunship coastline and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Put an end to the development and testing of the F-35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is an essential step to improve and respond to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How can we identify a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the recent headlines indicates how deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican nominee for president Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports a football coach retired sexually assaulted boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week President Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie has destroyed careers and country convulsé. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and celebrity Internet Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by quickly issuing denials contradicted by evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former candidate for the presidency John Edwards has been accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, no one who experienced history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky affair. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to get on their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On a given day, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of them are pious lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners will lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to get who said: &quot;I haven&apos;t been,&quot; the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search for such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of research is that the most ancient myths about the lies have been démystifiés. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars you look in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They are not bégayent, feeling or not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, facial expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerge from the knowledge of the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are adept at reading others, comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the extroverted lie more than introverted men say more lies &quot;citizen-centred&quot; while women say more lies &quot;focused on the other&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are seen as a calling, others will feel less guilty of lying to you. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, look at the normal behaviour of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is what is called &quot;benchmarks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring future changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Look at the shape of your subject, laughter, voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You need to know if someone normally hit his feet constantly in order to not launch unfair accusations when you see Slinging feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then look for signs of misleading verbal and non-verbal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Misleading people can stop the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can hold their feet to the door, leaning out, change significantly posture or present a relief &quot;interview&quot; - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview was completed just to try to trigger the reaction after the interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also, look at the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson skidded through the past while pretending that his wife murdered were alive, triggering a national search to find. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Misleading individuals can also use a strong language: &quot;I have not had sexual relations with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky&apos;s dress&apos; or repeat entirely a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;bush&quot; in its response to a difficult question: &quot;Well... to say... if I remember... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by hustlers in their personal and professional lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the US </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the area ecologically sensitive dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win its approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The official, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;It is a real way forward,&quot; said Terry Lee, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and he expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 2,735 kilometers pipeline extending from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do so, it would cross six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have focused on the 20,000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan have lobbied for a law to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact study of the State Department has found that the project would have only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry has said that the Inspector General of the Department has ordered a separate investigation of the review process focused on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company that has been hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly caused a young child to vomit in fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says that the fat lady Disco Patti LaBelle embarked on a spate of violence in the foyer of their building in Manhattan, has terrified the girl to the point where she vomited in fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The singer tirade &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; has alarmed the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, so that she has suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;the increased fear of foreigners,&quot; said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year when the scene technician Kevin Monk, his wife teaches kindergarten, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to travel with their families. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk snaked down in the foyer of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Geneviève in his arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk stated that she had stopped near the door and asked his daughter for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Somebody came up behind me and told me: &apos; Do you know what your daughter?&quot; I said &quot;yes&quot; and I was looking for, &quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle chastised with anger the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;She told me of an aggressive tone:&quot; you should not let your daughter near the door, &quot; said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I replied:&quot; what you say or do not want. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became rabid and began to use expletives - the word &quot; &quot; and the word &quot; &quot; a strong voice... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water and began rained water from the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to this woman:&quot; look at what you did to my daughter, &quot; said the mother of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was still in his arms - and had to be restrained by his entourage who was dragged into a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but has received no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity cancer for children. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct,&quot; said Mr. Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with a child of 18 months.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Adversity has slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity from the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Temperatures in February, causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the economy of the state for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31,16% in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report by the frozen allocations from the Mexican Council of Rural Development Soutenable, there has been damage of 582 million 835 hectares, including a 78.03 percent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21,07% have suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because while the January to March, 55,000,053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53% of Population Economics Active, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28% and from July to September, the average has continued to raise up to $6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 sinaloens thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand people 969. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we see is a rise in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to combat the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars illegally is not easy as they work to earn, invest and use them in something,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment rise,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Lack of seriousness </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the sinaloen labour market worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60,38% of the population in this state are working without pay as a worker with no social insurance institution. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the discrepancy is the low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly income of sinaloens workers was, until September, 5,000,352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> The decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the greatest reduction of Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat for Economic Affairs from January to June the state&apos;s FDI reached 630,000,697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the 5,143,000 312 million recorded in the same period of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State recorded a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly by service sector companies. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> Debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the state has requested in July at the congress public approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim to reactivate the economy, the approval of the Congress of the State has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there has been no benefit of debt in any sector of the economy of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> For the representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel López Loredo, president of the National Industry Chamber of Transformation, said that in 2011 there has been no harmonisation of the wishes of the different sectors, below the Government of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we need to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to align the efforts of all and especially the smooth already synchronized of this new government team, let us hope that next year is much better,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Economic sluggishness </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have kept the economy of the state and restricts its performance and growth. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The fluxe low economic product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is quickly enough to generate economic dynamism that makes it possible to have an acceptable level flows in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing far below expectations that we had,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Redefining the vocation </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronale Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that you want to channel the state towards productive activities more dynamism. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In general terms we have observed that it has worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that we are out of place all the potential of the human and material resources of Sinaloa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Much to do </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of future channels better efforts by the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there has been some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programma,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way of public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> &quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard, and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Sentenced to 8 kilos of marihuana </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office of the Republic was informed that the small smuggler sentenced Omar Valenzuela Alexis Sandoval, for crimes against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for sale. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> According to the file PA/INS / / 687/2010/M - I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in the street Cipriano Valdez, number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The small dealer was travelling in a truck, white pick-up, in which he was carrying a black bag in the baggage of the vehicle and the co-pilot&apos;s place a small backpack, where the military has found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana. </seg>

<seg id="1904"> Debts to contributions to books </seg>
<seg id="1905"> The works of social contemplés in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The Director of Social Development said that even if construction programmes have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25% and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their final stages. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> &quot;They must provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end they gave nothing, even though since July they have given us a part,&quot; he said, &quot;and we do not record delays, we started the works and we have achieved a lot, but we need the money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1909"> He mentioned that the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided at this time. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;We had already suffered in the previous sexennal period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and programmes continue to function and this year, to be able to have access to these programs, we duu have the resources to cover what the state had not paid,&quot; détailla said. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> In spite of the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management that the corresponding percentages are as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> &quot;They have to provide almost 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The Court valid &quot;analogue&quot; in Mexico by 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The substitution of analogue signales is one of the largest exchange rates that the world has suffered the last few years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called &quot;digital divide&quot; from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, attached the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft, drawn up by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, has proposed the declaration of the decree as constitutional, because of the fact that the rules on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> The draft voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and acknowledging complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by the government for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary session of ministers resolved also dismiss the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his speech, the minister president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive branch cannot structure through general standards that the public administration is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I do not think it would affect the autonomy of the regulator,&quot; and he pointed out that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has constitutional mandate the direction of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitution of signales analog by digital signales is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and this is reflected in a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postponing the change, argued, would postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, &quot;because it also includes economic, social, political and national security.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These questions, noted, &quot;require the operation of any establishes a system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution gives the power of the executive branch of the state.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the digital transition, and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> We cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere laws issued by the Législative himself. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> The possibility of a &quot;vote by vote&quot; recount in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the data highlighted by PERs, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand total 74 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Électoraux Results Program background (PER) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (AEI), María de los ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal reforms in electoral matters. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> We will remember that Michoacán has not licensed nor its constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Act of Justice, while the Congress of the State has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline so that this trial can enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in time by the Law of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Législative Power and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to &quot;sanction or challenge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed on the possibility of &quot;vote by vote,&quot; María de los ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the guidelines by the General Council of AEI it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counting of votes by the local electoral body. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Thus, the partial count of votes, one or several electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not for the president; or there are obvious errors or alterations minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> In addition, the total count of votes in all ballot boxes from the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the supposed winner of the election and the one who won the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition that has presented the second of the candidates reported. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total count of the vote can be achieved if at the end of the joint statement makes clear that the difference between the supposed winner and the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, cases in which one will exclude the electoral packets that have been subject to the partial count. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It is worth mentioning that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PPRD, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16%, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1959"> Three men were found murdered in shooting in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property in the municipium of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometre of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> A few people who have gone through this place have observed that in the property, the fence was the color beige and coffee the portal was largely open. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Looking inside, approximately three metres, they found the bodies of three people, why they immediately informed the relevant authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> One was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, with no shoes; there was another with a white T-shirt with suspenders. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> At one metre there was the body of another man with a red T-shirt and blue jeans. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The three were lying on the belly. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because it has not found in situ. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> In the closing of the property there were legends made by a group of organized crime, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> 11 captured in Cadereyta </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The Secretary of National Defence has made the presentation of 11 people, between which a minor, which formed part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta municipium and who are considered to have connection with kidnappings, homicides, &quot;halconeo&quot; (surveillance) and clandestine burials. </seg>

<seg id="1976"> The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> It is expected that he presents a cabinet in its majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said that he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European Commissioner for journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti has not explicitly said that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &quot;framework is now well mapped out,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to sustain. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Underlining the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of the markets placed the Italian BTP bond yield 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: &quot;We said that we would support a lot of this government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy in this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The chances of success of Monti have been greatly boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> &quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good outcome,&quot; said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The support of PDL, Italy&apos;s largest party, is significant because until now many of its members opposed to the Government of majority technocrat, Monti. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Parliamentary support </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be reforms of unpopular austerity. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers&apos; groups and juvenile and women&apos;s organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> He will end his tour of meetings on Tuesday night. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt are now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the financial defences current euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said that his government should persist in future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that the politicians only give them time to implement the reforms before bringing forward the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist on the fact that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political sources have indicated that the mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties complicate the trial to include political figures. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> The experience of Spain is superior to that of the Costa Rican </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Costa Rica, only one of the 22 candidates participated in 50 meetings. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by the two countries for the friendly today, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium in San José. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> While the national champions of Europe, the number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, an extensive record of games selected class A, the Habs had only defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have 50 international matches. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain intense activities in league championships and national Cup and disputes in European Cups and the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> All this should add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> The Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> We see that the greatest record of the Spanish goalie Íker Casillas, who earlier Saturday against England (0-1 in London) equaled the record of former goalie Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Xavi Hernández, Barcelona, 106. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside other ibérienne team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Loan centennial is Carles, with 97 games. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> The Costa Rican side, and Michael Umaña are the left lateral Júnior Díaz, with 48 minutes and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> After that, only five have exceeded 30 games: Keilor NAVAS with 31, with 32 Azofeifa Randall, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The least. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Those who have less, with more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31). </seg>
<seg id="2024"> The national side, with less than 30 minutes, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and 23 Myrie Roy. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> The rest is not even 20. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson begins again. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The historic striker of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Quinteto includes the country in turn to celebrate two decades </seg>
<seg id="2030"> &quot;Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2031"> In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> They have waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will be a dream to happen in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva Brazil last week. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> The group is in the South American side of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its unique stopover in Central America. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> This day will be available on the National Stadium, from 19:30 hours, alongside the Group of Los Angeles The X and Las Robertas. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> This is an excerpt of the conversation, the full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream: are you aware of what your fans live? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is our second time in South America and Central and until now it has been awesome. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think we can spend a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> We émotionne our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I would ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live in the previous days. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What is your message to your most ardent supporters? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for staying beside us for all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> There have been 21 years for us in Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry for the fact that so much time has had to spend up to this concert. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people are already saying that the concert is the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Does this adds a bit of pressure on your visit. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has been for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> We are very eager to produce. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we love to surf and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How have you discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends would always be surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, Mexico, are great places to do; it is that we have learned, through the gents who love surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions with regard to what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe that this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have seen for a very long time, it helps to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we love these songs and that we can have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> The show is more interesting for us and therefore I believe that it is also becoming more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Looking back, it is hard to believe everything that you have succeeded? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a great rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years is that it seems a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together we émotionne a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is not very common. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a group of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out simultaneously in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud, and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We still play with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with them and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle that has emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a group like your stays united and with the same members for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and this is much more time than many groups normally. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are concerned for all the others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and that there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of everyone and it could get better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew up, it has been easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of large masses and people who love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If you do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not forget that we must respect the music and, without putting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which does not really interested in any of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we have written good songs and at the beginning it was awesome. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We have been a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little, and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was a human being surprising and we lack. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, we sent videos with different proposals and this one was the group that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> What you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It is he who sings and I think that it does so with the first words he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Like bassiste, what are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first I remember Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has Pearl Jam has maintained the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe that all of us feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have appeared at the same time, and if it is now, I think this is wonderful, because it is a music that is worthwhile to listen and groups like Mudhoney are now music better than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning, his music had a more obscure content, and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What should this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End Just Breathe &quot; qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With the two, when Ed played for me, I cried when I have listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that if you richer and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also believe that we can also be happy and even as it can be done to obscure music. </seg>

<seg id="2124"> An official procession, with head Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will introduce Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political issues in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda distributed by the Uruguayan Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive to the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,&quot; according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its Web page. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> According to the local media, Mujica is seeking to persuade Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that has provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Mexico chairs since November the G20, a group of developed and emerging countries in the world, and with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> The Uruguayan government has tried the last few years to send the implementation of the agreements to exchange tax to get out of the &quot;brand name knock-off list&quot; of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries not to enforce all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations. </seg>

<seg id="2133"> Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but it had never done in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of the young stereoscopic technology. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> The title, which arrives this month to stores throughout the world, has been designed from the outset to exploit the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which makes it possible to play in three dimensions without using glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &quot;Mario is the man who must say as to operate the stéréoscopie without glasses,&quot; said the head of press for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Álvarez said that &quot;super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first video game Nintendo initially designed for this medium,&quot; because up to now successes as &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of 3D time&quot; was adaptations of existing titles. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is a video game &quot;accessible&quot; which allows a rapid and fluid part. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Álvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to garner less adept users. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Once overcome, experts will be able to make a &quot;second round&quot; game, which this time are more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> In addition, users will be able to choose between an &quot;aggressive&quot; or that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2141"> This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which no longer happened since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> In these video games Nintendo is a glance at the followers of the saga and repeat the successful formula of previous games, which lies in the fact that the plumber and mustache must travel platforms undermined perils to liberate Princess Peach. </seg>

<seg id="2166"> Property occupied by squatters for holidays, evacuated </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The invaders had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, Balmes, 51 </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the number 51 Balmes Street had ended. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people have abandoned at midday yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they held celebrations désespéraient neighbours, by judicial order and without need for intervention by the police. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> At the end of the operation changed the lock on the door to prevent the situation is repeated. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From that day there will be a control of access,&quot; affirmât administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited, overtook electrical and water, to paint the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted until two days and désespéraient tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Beside the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been affected. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> His owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that the occupation of the building his business has fallen 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque said that the invaders of the property was unfair competition, because they were selling drinks at three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> In addition, the owner of local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbours for the noise, while, according to the Commission, the trouble was not caused by clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially the participants in the celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense the last few weeks, according to the neighbours angry over the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The head of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that it has even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months &quot;forgive&quot; the rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The chairman of the City of the PP group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week &quot;the immediate evacuation of the building to do away with the problems of living together and civility that it caused to residents and the degradation of the zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and that in some apartments there have been flights. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> It is in this sense that he added that &quot;we must put an end to impunity and be ruthless against anti-social behaviour in the property.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday, the Mossos (local police) evacuated a building we Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 3.30pm the police moved into the number 35 Street Mount, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had found that four people gained access to the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four were arrested immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy about the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the middle of the 1980s, heyday of the already extinguished Corporation Barcelona Metropolitan (CMB), this Administration has printed posters to promote Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as the great park in metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In addition, it also contained a comparison figures, with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with pigs in the role of the Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all gateways to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door brings to the idea of park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> It is this, or someone wants to put doors on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is: Collserola: park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both in terms of its organization as a reflection on the town is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected officials speak when they see themselves in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this is one of the few opinions on which three architects of Barcelona, university professors, are presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after addressing the littoral front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot; because the rhetoric of Ildefons Cerda, green blocks of houses has not been conducted. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It takes from the base that the larger park in Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;gave the verdict the architect for which the title of&quot; Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap lexicon: &quot;There is no need to think about them&quot; such as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which we must act. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;a few perils.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The perils of &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s and has been in the area of the Forum, &quot;his swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something means the next step,&quot; i.e., its excess. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We need to think about new instruments planning, planning, because the current reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP) ] can cause genuine disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> More to the point, Modol felt that, by simplifying the region&apos;s El Valles Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat &quot;must not be lost,&quot; thanks for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, it meant that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the free ticket that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; whether this looming technique must lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success,&quot; he says) that: &quot;We, the architects, should only be an instrument.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the bases of the competition it lacks a comprehensive vision of Collserola: &quot;We convened 16 cross-cutting competition - he said - in the mountains, but there is not a longitudinal reading and understanding the area as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This is, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Dalt Ronda should include, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal proxy Red Casino gave forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail </seg>

<seg id="2226"> He stayed there during the 49 days when he gave a second detention order after the officer prosecutors dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19 October he was transferred to the criminal centre Cadereyta alleged to have been singing with a million and a half of the owners of the Red Casino; but he has spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On 25 October a restraining order has been issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as those relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gaming house in exchange for its operation. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the legal power of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom over the following hours. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the legal formalities, the agent of the prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and the home game was the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer has tried to withhold the name. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> By virtue of the record 197/2011 provides the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and later there will be no claim in the lawsuit against him; he will require no compensation for the damage and no punishment. </seg>

<seg id="2234"> The Clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, has moved up to the municipium prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his case would be classified. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> It will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued. </seg>

<seg id="2254"> It is likely that &quot; cloud the crew has sought a zone of weaker and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The details of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there is no loss of control or alteration of the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a small area. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact took place on a lateral and the right path. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of dispersal of remnants of the aircraft allows us to assume that the helicopter crashed on the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> It has not detected traces of fire or explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work we found pieces of the aircraft at a height of 9,000,200 feet above the average level of the sea, the soil had a slope that runs from seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly désarticulé during his journey. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful research in an area larger than the area circled around the accident, it has not found disperses pieces of the aircraft, which bears the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people; this is borne by experts from the NPI </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute for Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that he is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol &quot; notion of obesity in children and adolescents&apos; which will have the genetic markers associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a press release, the head of the Unit of Biochemistry Medical Investigation of Expertise Hospital National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by experts and students from third round of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The investigation is invited to participate or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS Valle de México, where is the evidence for minors every Saturday from 8:00 pm. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity is taking place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Having achieved the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and know the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify among children and young Mexican risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As we celebrate on 14 November the World Day of the Diabètes, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires to food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of heredity diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He detailed that Saturday will be applied to all participants of the anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and seeks to identify the people associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> López Cruz pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, 77% in obesity and in the case of girls 47 percent; as far as overweight has also increased dramatique&apos;, said the IMSS specialist. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He was informed that on average, the Mexican has a 65% of Indian-American ancestry, a 30% and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess energy that it consumes (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which makes it possible to detect if they are overweight or obese. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> However, he said that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and arm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors put in writing to the parents, which explains each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must do to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> López Cruz explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentary lifestyles, which is the lack of physical activity daily, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another reason is the high intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrate (tamales - pâté of meat cornmeal wrapped in leaves of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic analysis in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt UNAM blackcurrants </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signales that the streets were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair around 200 thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ-resistant gonorrhea) of the UNAM, which has ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous pavement is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During its conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible for developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Nájera Herrera has estimated that this type of modified asphaltes could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently, the training of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest share of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes and molecules with a molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give paved its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changed during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperatures, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The FQ-resistant gonorrhea researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the most superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones drenched in asphalt and compacted later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the small stones that form the layer, signalât says, is asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When the vehicles are generating efforts, it allows that the forces spread very well in the streets. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If we had modified asphalt, they are transmitted better, opinât the chemical engineers. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the asphalt layer, he said, a final layer called turnover layer gemstone, i.e., sand, which is also bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the layer of rotation also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they affect significantly the performance of the asphalt layer. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the soil is wet, water spreads inside the layer is difficult, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the trial of a cassis, he said, the first blight is the film rolling and only later affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with proper maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the National System Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer must be always linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the bitumineuses emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What has failed in the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not get the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle is number 14 princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content themselves with being on the winning podium, wearing the crown of money and the band accreditation as a new Princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department already 14 titles of Princess and Melina a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who found themselves close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Ayala Bellini (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many people are asking is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What is he missed? Because the result represents the defeat of a favorite in each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen&apos;s Police and Best Visage Jolie in Vogue, credential by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who won the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the vow to appoint Princess First is the fact that she was not satisfied with her answer to the question? &quot; what was the book that marked and why? Posed by Martín MURILLO Gómez, the Literaria Carreta Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the response of the candidate of Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that this is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think that the book that marked my childhood is&quot; the Little Prince ,&quot; it is a fairly profound book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &apos; crime and Châtiment ,&quot; it is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called&quot; blood .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response did not like first because of the term &quot;culturaliser&quot; and secondly for not concretely how each book quoted was marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome &quot; the universe and wise, what needs to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for everyone, please read a little, &quot;the little prince&quot; is a great book. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the assumptions that Valle was destroyed by patronage. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favourite, enthusiastically applauded and the candidate who received the preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;this has aroused the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It was noted that in his first presentation in swimsuits at the beach Hilton and his two parades on the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even if the two parades she seemed self-confident, noted that she lacked the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist &quot;como en casa&quot; (like at home), Canal NCR said that the fact that Melina was designated princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price during the competition is not the crown of Queen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> This is why two days before the election, the international juror Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed with regard to the social needs of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It also speculates that Valle sinned by its flaws behind and fibrosis who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the board elected him as the candidate &quot; naturelle&apos; Beauty with a healthier body, good diet and exercise responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The initiator of queens Hernán Jorge Orozco studied acknowledges that Melina was not the best body, that it was better, &quot;but his biggest problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too well known, he has left points on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the Cromos magazine considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle was the surgery that she had suffered. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;Surgeries are good, but Valle has not been able to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For that price, the National Beauty Contest awards for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has posed a cruel prediction that unfolded last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by designation of the National Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will be in history as one of the queens that despite his dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not won the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> This was the work of the Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste of Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The past November 4, an ITC dactyloscopiste Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonso Cano,&quot; contrasting his fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of &quot; Eliazar disponibilité&apos; González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Chocó, where a lot of times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place in which the corpses were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and after appropriate courses, he specializes in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had warned Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something very great expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he had to identify two corpses, and that it suspected that one of them was that of the man who headed the oldest guérrilla in the world, therefore asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Sáenz León (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more meagre. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a galtonienne microscope, ink, an undertaking the harvest and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye did not wrong: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Sijín dactyloscopiste in Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano,&quot; is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> To identify the corpses, the dactyloscopistes supports the investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When caught, many offenders have false identity cards or have no documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We are taking fingerprints and looking in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a safe full of jewelery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not adequate to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently we found a man dead, with bottles of drink around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Interlude of the investigation has determined that a parent can be suspect of the crime and an imprint on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if this number not guarantee that he is the murderer, this place on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste of the ITC explained that extracted &quot;the fingerprints of objects with physical or chemical reagents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, using an undertaking the harvest or a band to collect. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the déclinquents database, or the Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there is still a lot of undocumented Colombians,&quot; said the ITC expert. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the television programme CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Like all that glitters is not gold, touch is not necessarily a footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, it can be used, if it achieves the necessary confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Outraged&quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators jumping to the Zuccotti camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A lot of people have joined the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The movement&apos;s integral Occupe Wall Street defied Tuesday the authorities in New York in trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators tussle with the Zuccotti, where they wanted to get through a judicial order that allows indignés&apos; to stand again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation by occupying a park north of the city, where there has been new judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court allows us not to stand again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the movement&apos;s spokesmen &quot;Wall Street,&quot; Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray explained that the response of indignés&apos; to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has come up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, the indignés&apos; have occupied a new park at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, property of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the police came and arrested some protesters, even though she was unable to confirm the actual figure, Efe by the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there are people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved as a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In the meantime, the Zuccotti - which is a forum of private property - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing Tuesday during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> A few demonstrators moved previously wore and handing out copies of the judiciary and even the agents who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small affrontements&apos;, said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the Occupe Wall Street or to enforce &quot; laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit demonstrators access to the park with tents or other properties they used auparavant&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the demonstrators, to which he has, however, alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and bags to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti, an operation during which arrested 200 people and which was decided because of the fact that the demonstrators violated law. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became &quot;a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do harm to other people,&quot; because &quot;some stores had received threats&quot; and residents were afraid &quot;for their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation of this morning at dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor of &quot;not respecting freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> &quot;Wall Street&quot; have also indicated that they do not think organized &quot;big action&quot; on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on 17 September. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television programme of Noel </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, it will come out in the television program &quot;it&apos;s Russell Peters Christmas&quot; next December 1 </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant Tim Allen in &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; rescuer &quot;Baywatch,&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot; rabbit, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Noel Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the &quot;crooner&quot; (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will emerge in the television program &quot;it&apos;s Russell Peters Christmas&quot; next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV has now distributed images of the television programme in which Anderson, also known for its wide dissemination on the Internet a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband this time, the Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, is dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll representing Jesus in a crèche. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who presented recently part of &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; by Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires Argentina&apos;s model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not himself away from controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot; pute&apos; American Kim Kardashian for one of his concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan renait after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP rose 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of decline in the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the month of March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, fragile even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the loss to 300 million, a blow that, in spite of the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used for closure: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of purchases of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures for January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that calls to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan woke up mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable increased 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo was given to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become a &quot;values refuge&quot; elected by investors who are fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege hanging like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a divided, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic slack is determined by the health of large technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the assessment of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not drop the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the member countries have presented in September clearer signals of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are limited. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Because it dropped four decimal points up to $100.4 points, compared to $100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Eurozone has even been above the average, which is in the 100, dropping eight decimal points to 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens is fueling doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the risk premia peripheral and uncertainty resettled in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major crisis of European debt. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional Government Helennic is imposed by the demands of Brussels by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in his appointment may be short to apply, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures in no case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the planned datte of 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras emerging doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservatif leader has gone a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF must unlock the 8000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and has made it clear that it will not approve any letter of commitment adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the referendum last-minute bargaining chip Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return &quot;very soon&quot; in Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, even if there is a final date. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greeks still have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Queen Sofía: &quot;These are instruments for progress and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen highlights the &quot;important role&quot; of Spain in relation to this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has reached a prominent place in the world in the role of Micro Finance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía recalled that the country in the last two decades has become the second donor in the world in relation to this instrument of cooperation that &quot;gasoline&quot; lies in the fact that it is an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen opened yesterday the V- e World Summit of Micro-credit Valladolid with the certainty that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &quot;very specifically, reducing half the volume of people who live with incomes below a dollar a day, which is set the&quot; poverty line .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot; responsibility, &quot;said Queen Sofía, who had hoped that the initiatives and origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday,&quot; guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women, &quot; the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have &quot;achieved many goals&quot; and &quot;we face many challenges.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Micro-credit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it takes &quot;two basic goals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of the poverty line in which they live now. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the trail initiated a few years in a pioneering manner&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofía as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she described the father of this instrument as an &quot;admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty,&quot; which it has since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to see on the ground its lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I saw a continuing evolution,&quot; said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term &quot;head of family&quot; meeting at Valladolid on the part of the &quot;deep pocket of the poor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethic imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The External Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an essential ethic&quot; for any democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a &quot;permanent obligation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that micro-credits require &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of the developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow that it is the victim of cutbacks. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation for development.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; to give &quot;confidence&quot; to the people &quot;excluded all close the door&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the participants to the people in a city that opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor, but also president of the Christian Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme but has imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider government policy too lax Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes were right, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, left no room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea - the Chancellor - and the motion - is a slogan: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the fiscal policies of the countries of the eurozone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage &quot;in order to give a face to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Of course, it is unlikely that the EU27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone is raised. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which of course meant to strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its congress on the backs of the &quot;smaller&quot; European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeat of Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What is the fraud judgments disease? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments disease. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and give a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and handouts. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralded an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sickness rates. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First budget savings: the government plans to impose on employees of private a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without any specific agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, at least 15% of its monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that threatens to spark anger, but which would yield EUR 280 million, according to The UK. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic significance: impose officials a day of uncompensated work stoppage (they have so far not waiting period from three days in the private). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority relaunch the issue of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to the work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you repay,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to the work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is indeed the subject since 2002 to constant monitoring and offensive policies, which are most often paid off. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French no more ill than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> We first focus on the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than 237 million euros per diem were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in economics of health, daily allowances accounted for in 2008 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> On this amount, 46% were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were sickness rates, or 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And therefore 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have experienced an average 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day to stop disease. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time of medicare, states that in 2010, 37% of sickness rates were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% above. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, employees are no more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A lengthy study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for reasons of health or not), in France, between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud judgments disease represents very little undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> With regard to fraud, it reached only a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 that the controls are systematic on sickness rates of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the NHIF found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term judgments were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; or 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the judgments of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of cases &quot;inappropriate or unwarranted&quot; about 1.2 million, or 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total, 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified,&quot; over several million workers who have been stopping disease. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents very little, for example, that of undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of loss of tax revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new adjustment programme to redress its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what said Monday 14 November the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, before the European Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to its unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment,&quot; said the head of the government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, because the country&apos;s participation in the euro area &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> As a result, Mr. Papadémos has predicted that the country&apos;s public deficit will be reduced to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right to refuse new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, has given Monday its support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not be an additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favour of new measures,&quot; he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has warned that the IMF and the EU does not débloqueraient the loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would sign nothing under external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> We need to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In the area of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> Society lives in denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to this effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report from the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is required, with a patient deemed competent to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> First-off, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it will change the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to the experts, who have also gone through all the countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this leads to decriminalization of abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not willing. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, stated yesterday by teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, would be more cases of these excesses specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians in favour of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for people who have assisted suicide, asked to 41% that they should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In terms of maintaining or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals are trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In the area of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce the physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reservations from other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, an expert in health law, called &quot;extreme&quot; the position of experts signatories of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who would have more than 18 years could ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; said Ms. Fields, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to put the autonomy of the person above all other values that contribute to the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;In society, he said, there are limitations and constraints.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The law expert Margaret Somerville has also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, which she called &quot;manifest pro-euthanasie.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenged the data in the report about the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised in the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Damascus denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Syria is increasingly isolated </seg>
<seg id="2556"> Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday in the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, and denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against the country. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, bordering Syria, have taken a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;leave power&quot; in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;If Bashar had to heart the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> &quot;Those who are not in the Middle East peace with their people and cannot satisfy the will,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, another country with which Turkey has adopted an increasingly hard line. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The US has welcomed a &quot; strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> &quot;The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone&quot; in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime perished in the region of Deraa in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH). </seg>
<seg id="2566"> Two other civilians have died in exchanges of gunfire and shelling with heavy machine guns at Jobar &quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid imprisonment has estimated that the country is &quot;heading towards the end of the crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2568"> He has strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its work, which is &quot;a very dangerous step.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Syria &quot;does not waver,&quot; he added, assuring that &quot;the ourdis conspiracies against Syria will fail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2570"> After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a &quot;mechanism to protect civilians&quot; and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favored the sending of observers from the UN to help protect civilians of the repression of the regime that he locks himself in the &quot;paranoia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2572"> A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities plagued by the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday &quot;incorrect&quot; the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Italy </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Monti markets and sacrifices to the Italians </seg>
<seg id="2576"> The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time for the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain &quot;sacrifices,&quot; in order to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the trade unions and employers. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> It should put in place a firm relatively composed of technocrats from outside Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> &quot;Monti has spoken of an important program with a lot of sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco the member of one of the many small groups engaged in the talks, after having met with the President of the Council appointed. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part said expect that Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The consultations will be completed by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them time. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> &quot;Democracy, there are timelines&quot; to prepare a government and its agenda, he stressed, saying &quot;certain that the markets will be patient and understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2584"> His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The prime minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he wants to include &quot;policies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Mr. Monti pledged, once in office, to work in the emergency and in order that Italy &quot;protagonist&quot; in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for new austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will be on Tuesday, has also insisted on the need to revive the economy, &quot;because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as a European commissioner (1994-2004), represents a &quot;change of epoch&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;berlusconisme,&quot; the &quot;teacher&quot; symbolizing &quot;the serious challenge&quot; and &quot;other Italy,&quot; according to the editorialists. </seg>

<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said Monday, an American NGO specialising in nuclear risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Atomic Security (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The IAEA reported last week its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to ISIS largely from documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center at Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing &quot;nano diamonds&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic difficulties of his company would have led to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> He would then cooperated in the Iranian programme in 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its latest report, the IAEA refers to &quot;strong indications that the development by Iran&quot; of a nuclear detonation system &quot;has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme in his country of origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Anti-Muslim crimes and offences have increased by 50% </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other religious and racial violence have declined slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, against an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against Jews and an increase of 14% of crimes and offences anti-religious. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; rose marginally to 6,628 cases, 47.3% motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again,&quot; said Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in antimusulmanes violence is particularly significant,&quot; said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights,&quot; said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses,&quot; he said, arguing that it could pass through improved police reports on &quot;hate crimes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The &quot;hate crime&quot; in the US federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, colour, religion, origin and now sex. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Twitter is changing its platform and is more akin to Facebook </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The site of micro blogging Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which is like a little more than Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> A new &quot;activity&quot; and another &quot;name&quot; to follow more legibly, direct the activity of other &quot;Twittos,&quot; which follows the messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) and those who will follow. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> This allows us to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> This new form of Twitter has been tested &quot;on a small percentage of users in August&quot; before being distributed to the entire network Monday, told the AFP spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend another user) happiness insiders, opens to a wider audience with a more comparable to those of mainstream networks Facebook and Google +. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> On the network, users discussed &quot;tweets&quot; decided on the value of this innovation. </seg>

<seg id="2622"> Austria </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Registration of a fiscal &quot;golden rule&quot; in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The government of Social Democrat/Christian Democrat ruling coalition in Austria decided Tuesday to enshrine in the constitution a fiscal &quot;golden rule&quot; in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration in the credit rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the solvency of Austria was lowered one notch from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year,&quot; argued Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria following a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the eurozone on 26 October: the heads of state and government had called for the registration by the end of 2012 for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The system adopted by the Austrian government is moving closer to the &quot;German model,&quot; Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> By 2017, the public deficit will decrease each year from 0.75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the public deficit of the federal state should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The goal is to move to 2020/21 public debt below the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threat of a new intervention in the foreign exchange market </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would once again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will act as we have done the last time if we see an excessive volatility&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, &quot; said Mr. Noda in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen was near historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo has massively sold yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record since 1945 against the greenback. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar rose Tuesday in 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, near levels that have triggered the latest intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it says the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan struggle to rebuild&quot; since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the region in the Tohoku (northeast), said Mr. Noda who fear that the rise of the yen does not kill in the bud the fragile recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter of 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption leaded by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister has ruled that the high yen does not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures,&quot; suggesting that no monetary flexibility was to wait until Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> At its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emissions increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasuries, increasing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling amounts that it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Euro area: </seg>

<seg id="2649"> The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue their ascent. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Always worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock markets moved a little more into negative territory, Tuesday 15 November. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris, at 10: 00am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The DAX in Frankfurt yielding 0.4% and 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;With the new tensions on the bond yields in the euro zone states in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, with renewed fears of market players about Europe&apos;s ability to contain the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a corridor of narrow fluctuations that investors will not evidence that the situation is stabilized,&quot; says Mitsushige Akino, manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> This renewed concerns about the future of the euro penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro is changing at its lowest level in a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> At 10am, the European currency is worth 1,3570 dollar, declining 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to brokers, it has fallen after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU congress Monday, has adopted a motion that includes the possibility for a country struggling to get out of the eurozone without leaving the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Spanish and Italian rates far beyond 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, Spanish debt maturity 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions on interest rates in the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is in the frontline of the markets, while Sunday&apos;s legislative elections in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The difference in rates (&quot;spread&quot;) between the bonds to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new high history. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of the growth figures for the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Statistics, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected by household consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> INSEE, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And, it is truly the fourth that worries most economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, for its part, has grown by 0.5% over the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> A first estimate for the whole of the eurozone is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has warned against the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts must outweigh the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is an issue that we cannot treat from short-term considerations or emotion, it is the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that a rendezvous is the opportunity to reflect on such issues and nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic changes will result in a doubling of electricity by 2050, unless depriving a huge part of the world population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident in Fukushima does none of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is the case of Belgium, which makes her the need to be able to find an alternative source able to substitute or Switzerland, which is just not built that last generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, are pursuing their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will translate into a rise in the price of electricity, energy dependence aggravated by the increasing reliance on imported gas, particularly from Russia, a surge of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas-fired power plants and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to ponder. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion of the wind, which derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice 40% more electricity to French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies have the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make false declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially given that they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> A strong exporter, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs on international markets and makes them very job-creating non-transferable. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as shrinking 6 billion euros of French exports nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What would a PRT designed to operate 60 years ago when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production d &quot; miracle power, nor that there is evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva of low emitters of CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, illustrates the complementarity of sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> We have a security authority in France that has a transparent and strict control over the existing plants on the site of Flamanville site. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and human unforgivable mistakes have caused the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and the French and German manufacturers, the PRT has a design making it able to resist such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While it is regarded by all electricians who want to build a power station, halting its construction to Flamanville site would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving them free to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate a debate as crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed &quot;country of human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming in passing that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is only rarely analysed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers,&quot; and left by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot accommodate all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the French company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the degree of generosity that daignera towards immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In his programme, François Hollande confined to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our &quot;migration problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem may be electorally profitable, but it is economically very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the recall economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (of People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restricting immigration anemic growth and damaging employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can substitute for domestic workers, especially low-skilled, to exert downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers, most of the trades in sectors lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training is not the supply of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized American Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also contributors of social systems, on average 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) from 150,000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, pick up the missing points of growth &quot;with teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, is to think European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a very fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be remembered for having invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has seen throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some were able to believe that it would be enough to ensure that democracy triomphât definitively from its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, since Napoleon &quot;Petit,&quot; that it was an ease of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and start a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The palinodie of the vrai-faux Greek referendum will be held in this regard revealing double value: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also the disturbing sense of impossibility, for its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today were displaced, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, held as necessities and disorganised. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank cheque to the European absolute monarch or a leap to feet in the vacuum of the nationalist downturn: what choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want cleavers but an exercise, right, calm and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we cannot stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is Europe as a whole conform to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to restore the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Having long fought this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is calling for the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Either. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But the thinking without a stronger democratic and political integration, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We need to take a new stage of European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> For the Republic in France, it took &quot;to&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution in interest could not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe more integrated economically. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can be done only by building a more democratic Europe on the political front, a genuine European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> In Europe, are Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Smart cards &quot;without contact&quot; spreading </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The World Fair smartcard opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 should be completed on an increase of 11% of global sales of smart cards (bank card, phone SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The most promising segment is the contactless technology that makes it possible to pay transit or to settle its purchases by simply approaching the map of a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, from 320 million a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card ($6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Long lagging behind in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million bank Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But mass merchandisers make strides. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour issued this year and 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To move to a higher level, it is now that banks on their clients. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two big French pledged to disseminate future systematically to their customers cards equipped to contact,&quot; announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment by mobile </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Few devices are now equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They have fallen behind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they should finally see a real boom next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We rely on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world,&quot; said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks are taking the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June at Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a holster authorizing the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the marketing of an offer to allow its customers to pay without contact with their mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Western Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Long suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now &quot;acquired certainty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which the two organisations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation,&quot; he said without more detail. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to make a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered bridges. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation launched by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators were to return several telephone chips belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the calls directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigérien who has travelled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a step forward, but we should probably expect more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;It has been known for years that the sect enjoys financial support and foreign intellectuals and that it is increasingly active,&quot; probably Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its methods, which include the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and even bill than those used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore lobbied Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated little interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A rapid success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means haoussa &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is undergoing a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicizing and requires a strict observance of Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These are first churches, bars, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The Abuja reaction is, as usual, without nuances. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army is the city, there are 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> So the sect will be radicalized and leave its northern fiefdoms. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Last Christmas, it claims an attack that 80 people were killed in Jos, then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram takes the secure headquarters of the police during an attack suicide, his first. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that is operating from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria worried now all security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and is willing to share all the information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry vie for superficiality and ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other increasingly loud statements and shortcuts in matters of foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - mounts. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the &quot;Grand Old Party,&quot; has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and &quot;for manipulation of their currency,&quot; a promising theme in an America fueled by the migration of large swathes of its industry to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> No wonder if this must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, the former China Obama and only candidate to have a vision of foreign policy sophisticated, almost strangle an attitude that &quot;suits&quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, who remains in the depths of the polls, is inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The image of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, I will leave Iran, he fanfaronné.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best candidate, has an embarrassing lack of records. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;is trying to develop a nuclear capability&quot; - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> It is far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current president argued that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he has won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of counterterrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the over-hasty departure &quot;boys&quot; in Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, hugging a small label. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attack is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population sees positive stock of Obama&apos;s national security, which has eliminated Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> In Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to the stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, on the grounds that there is a need to economically rebuild America to revive its leadership, Obama strikes fairer. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new ntrée of Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline directly linking Western Europe to Russia at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the giant Russian gas, has sought to celebrate the event. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government participated, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister of France François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve commander of Russian gas in the European-Western network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 kilometers linking the St Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And mention the possibility of building a third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion of this huge project victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream will indeed be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is to say if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, with its support for the Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe&apos;s energy, since the project has created a gap between East and West Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has been able, in five years ago, making his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon launching this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, in numbers to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine tube is steel gainé concrete in order to protect against ship anchors. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;One hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It has also taken more measures to protect flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: neither valve, nor station maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A monitoring platform was planned off Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were reluctant to see a society of Russian state permanently off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welds for a leak every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> In the form of a cigar, it is introduced in the tube, a metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on the possible distortions of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without having to undergo the slightest repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The flow of gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bars at the outset, and 100 on arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader is Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom was then leased to the company for 20 years, the entire gas transport capacity. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a brand notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> He has a whiff of adventures, hours to write in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular coverage, its elastic, leaves a white broken, as dated by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the book Moleskine as we know today was born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design but distinguished notes. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book is based on an old technique of production, the mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton varnish used to cover seats for example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of book was very popular among writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has given buzz-words an old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the mark in Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is there. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> It is far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to establish a profile of the buyer, because the rating attracts both the businessman that students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in bookstores, the FNACs small shops in downtown and was able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the air time and this new writing, despite the rise of Email,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists put their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it has also launched a leopard coverage at the Festival of the Locarno film. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and cultural Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer bags... the mark is on a range of formats. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that has made envious: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities remain so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of people with disabilities are in search of a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, says Eric Jacques-Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made over the past 15 years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;There is still a lot to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, the obstacles remain before access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are older: 37% more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% did not and 2.3 million students in higher education, 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, as many criteria more complicated the return to employment, and who &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> This is the brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> It remains unspoken, attitudes are changing, of course, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the IMS association - Initiate Precinct indicated that managers interviewed &quot;a low level of knowledge of disability,&quot; with a &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3%,&quot; says Pierre White, Director General of AGEFIPH&apos;s, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The evidence: the number of establishments &quot;taxed,&quot; just as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;Happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before facing the Azzurri on Tuesday evening (8.45pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure afforded this match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the mood gesture of his attack against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only praise. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I am very happy to Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to move forward,&quot; says Lillois. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As for the contrastre between his club benefits and selection, &quot;it&apos;s a whole, has justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille, I am the entire year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;It is important that I take my brands.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Against Romania Friday night for the game against France, Hazard comes at Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without forgetting, however, the notion of &quot;fun.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2970"> The Blues, he has promoted since the age of 7 years and victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I have always been bear,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Inevitably, this helps to strengthen the &quot;special character&quot; of this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Even in the face, &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil Rami),&quot; said he. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;It was earlier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Being able to play against them, it is only happiness!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With bonhomie, Leekens has spoken of &quot;pride.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; contest &quot;a gala match.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; - as a &quot;neighbour&quot; - that France is &quot;now a team of very high level&quot; a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a great job,&quot; he enthused. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would share the plane with the Blues... Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our small Belgians are great,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We are in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You are going to report in the coming matches.&quot; against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> Portugal Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimistic his return to Bosnia (10pm), Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> The move, the two teams had lacked realism. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento, in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is the joysticks since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to counter. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In view of the game to go (0 - 0) Friday in the hell of Zenica, it is clear that the games are not made. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;It is a good result, which entails a certain risk because we have not marked&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience that should be here too, even if the party is obviously &quot;very tight,&quot; as a lucid but optimistic Bento. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that they can take the upper hand,&quot; said the Portuguese coach for 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We continue to have 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012,&quot; has put the successor to Carlos Queiroz. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> No one reported Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> It may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;It is a good result, which entails a certain risk because we have not left outside,&quot; Bento regrets. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not give them time to reflect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea to be realistic, this time. </seg>
