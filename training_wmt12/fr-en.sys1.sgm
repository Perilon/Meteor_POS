<seg id="22"> When it is to seek the winners in Libya, the West is not part </seg>
<seg id="23"> We have participated in the fire, used Islam and our poilitiques have diverted the dictator as a political ally but it brings no benefit. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The feeding a child obese: does not not take breakfast and takes to the deli for lunch </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems of overweight, 9% of écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As the current research shows the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This shows again how important is the changing environment in which humans and the surrounding models. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Of the tables of obese children are for example of the deli 50% more often than in the families of children with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of obese had of french fries for dinner in the investigation with an advocacy &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of small large sport is also not a habit, which is now the case in most of today&apos;s students, only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents find the time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey on 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 students of primary schools in Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a chance,&quot; action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the beginning is more than 12,000 students from sixth to the third who have enrolled in the project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and obese children, is the lack of a proper food and not enough exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the children questioned indicates for example eat five times a day small dejeuner-en cases-Lunch-gouter- dinner, which is one basic principles of good food,&quot; said one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and deli at dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> The experts drew attention to the fact that to have a healthy development requires a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In Czech Republic, only 23% of families of the students eat in my time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the majority of families each took his breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst that has been identified is that a tenth of the population takes no breakfast at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is the basis of good food daily. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children is more often unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every student, not to mention the weight, drinking sugary beverage each day (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> Over 40 percent of the children questioned regularly made sport but for the parents it is of half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Prepares you your food </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey helped the children selected (204 males and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from alternatives according to their own taste and personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far, in terms of healthy eating, the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite meals there are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The more alarming is including a greater preference for the sweet lemonades,&quot; is shown in the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch is pasta which took the first place just before the white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Children have not at all appropriate starch and the preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Town on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The survey also showed that the children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the ad hoc information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;During a control of a group of participants in the survey that had completed the questionnaire after the advocacy meeting&quot; Obesity is not a chance, &quot;were attended a definite will to move towards a healthy eating,&quot; indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most striking was by example as regards the lemonades sweet because the children have begun to give preference to water consumption. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce sweetened foods and &quot;knedliky&quot; (Czech specialte pellets of potato bread or flour). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer should be also a good psychologist, say the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In an article reporting on how to learn for the designers, I put myself a little angry by the fact that there were many from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I didn&apos;t really think about what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of characters and a seminar on what is happening locally. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> As we approach the final exams and more we expect practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly &quot;full.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the Director Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the women who did not measurement standards. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend a neck or add necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrivals and to highlight nicely the character and also not to dress too conspicuous types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips made and a fine size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is such a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to be custom. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you will not regret it because the clothing that is impeccably is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a tailored skirt you feel much better that in that is permanently, spirals and is not in the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a male appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even of embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There is obviously much examples of&apos;apparences variety and I am pleased that I have the week to sort all information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also fear that, having regard to what I should do at home there are too many. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality and appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I should &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In substantive, it pleased me, because it is better than to dress up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who recently took almost one hundred kilograms (don&apos;t take my statement, please, completely seriously), or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sew from magazines or search the web, print and work the graphics. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard, as we say in the final outcome, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphics. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Graphic reflect also on the part of the styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The designer dresses not only the physical but creates productive example the pages in the magazines (on specific products trends for carry-on bags, coats, etc...). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, designer and graphic designer, spoke of this. </seg>
<seg id="138"> However,... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer must have a vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the meeting on Saturday full of information on the different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the designer should know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talented designer is work with a single clothing in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is important for this example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As such trench coats that must be raised from conventionally with a jeans and T-shirt as a lightweight coat but can also pay the naked body, with escarpins and take the photo as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or is to roll up the sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with it&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I particularly appreciated the following advice: &quot;For the work you need to know the rules well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You can then begin to break,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why it seeks to learn the rules, what to do with, where, why, when, in the fashion magazines is sometimes seen something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on the fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know of new, through fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have many more variants of clothing that are photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> It is to say that for fashion story to be a dozen or so pages (i.e. a dozen models) I must be ready to &quot;retailler&quot; at least a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And, a clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with this in the creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna which is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made it a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of services of designers are still cautious. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the familiar faces the sometimes regard as unnecessary (is that I know something but what I sound is the second highest). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone gets a styling of our hand, we must then rely on the fact that it dictates with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than it is in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> There is then to navigate on google and ascertain whether the news of Boulevard refer to the celebrity in question, if she lost weight or grown etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the mode and assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> It must communicate with the people he dresses and it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Knowledge guess the people, not to pander, retain its opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager asks you to sort his cabinet and completion of new things you cannot throw everything and say, My God what horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find some cases you will find attractive and you conseillerez it with what the bear,&quot; said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us specifically what must contain the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or bag of designer. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is that you hang around the waist and you on itself for everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition the things clearly defined as scissors, rolls to depilation or even the pins to nurse, there is also the nylon yarn (the designer used to photograph products such as bags, or many hats), special clips with which it closes a garment in the back, it is too high (the pin or other type of bar are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For we are not only of people who listen to but who tried something in practice they have taught us how ressemeller properly of footwear. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we bonded and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We did not have the right to receive the scissors to not inadvertently hurt. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It must therefore truly of skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The jurisdiction which I am condition is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a brief summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of the </seg>
<seg id="178"> Increasingly I began to understand that making the styling a profession is not a walk in the garden of roses, everyone says what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The need for speed The Run competes across the America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Revision </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without problem becomes due to a series of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do a routine morning shift at work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> This is to some extent the ambition of each but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new Part subtitled The Run produced high expectations before his release. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed already old and out a kind of game from parties jouables which not only would have with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were curious how the crossings will be added during which the main hero out of his car and done what it wanted. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what is atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> This are potentially of racing games arcades but the whole derives downwards due to some unnecessary errors that already exist for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> This are not really of errors but rather an expression of a idleness incomprehensible by the developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has emotional problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal racing across the America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your mission is to be the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This resulting that each race is on another route and the stages in different environments that are quite far from each other and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player did not feel a moment that the game offered something identical to it. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are quite nice even if the level of addition graphic technique is of the same type as the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Tests are also from time to time with a non-standard element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm which you significantly decreases the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> May in the mountains you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition to this the different races are well arranged behind each other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There is only a small number but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are moments you seek to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a conventional race) and you stand against the shows (classic duel with the stopwatch) and yet you expected another duel with an adversary. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time you also the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty are the passages out vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is rather to una interactive animation when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you have to help by typing on the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing fancy. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type that you expect (to be concrete there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> In result is as this because this element is not likely to interfere with and, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that currently there is nothing special but we cannot say that this is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Regarding the simulation realistic you should go see elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But although can find better in the conccurrence the model of conduct goes very well with the design type of races. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So everything is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems start to appear after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> At the diffference of model of conduct, the collision is not yet finalized. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We do not expect of this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don&apos;t have, in a collision with any object, the idea of how is your car, it is not completely right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During overruns tight you are sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise perform your car in part of the crazy acrobatics. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or is in tatters. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Through the system of recovery this is not really a problem but it really annoys you. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The restart is to ensure that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the stage the game will take you back to the time of the last point on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you do only have to 5 start-ups. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you used the 5 start-ups you must resume the game since the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is therefore more a tool, for the case where something is not happening as it should be, that quelquechose that you can really count on. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes the start-ups do not help and it must find the solution in rememorrant memory the piece of route in question. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The general problem of this game is that the same actions are in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example there are some turns that it must move from a certain way or it does not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you encounter on a given location of vehicles still &quot;civilians&quot; in the same way that you come first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What angry are the situations where you see easily get the opponent between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and the conturner or curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is equal if you go out of him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; in such a way that for the given situation it is always close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents still have other benefits. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent ahead at the same location. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This getting nervous most end of game when you drive on a long bridge in opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must at any price before you go. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it passes you you obstructs the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter colliding a number of times. </seg>
<seg id="237"> It can understand that the purpose of the game is to do something exciting and full of adredaline, but it is clear that bored quickly comes. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And injury because it is through a simple model of conduct the game is interesting and areas with both action that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And is equal if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change of car during the races. </seg>

<seg id="251"> At the preparation we had a discussion for a few days to determine if someone truly has reflected in the creation of this game or if we really take us for fools. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really cool. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What embarrassment is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This focuses on accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery you use more to nothing. </seg>

<seg id="277"> The Czechs behave as negativistes and the Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has radically deleted the balance between the institutions&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I did not expect to a war as hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;This last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role,&quot; is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law Czech Ambassador about the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="281"> When she was able to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations so visible and understandable, to the point that a large number of speakers at the Faculty of Law of the Charles University may envy, it has shown how it takes its motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe&quot; very seriously. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;From the beginning sounded the criticism it is bland, that is a rond-de-cuir, that it cannot rempplir mission and I must say that it has cut the time to everyone because it takes its role to perfection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;This is a man who knows listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defense Policy in the framework of an answer to the question: &quot;Who is that in the European Union?&quot; &quot;What do I call telephone number?,&quot; as an important step towards unity and greater clarity of the policy of the Union in the face of statements, as is China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese to pulp cooked smells very strong) </seg>
<seg id="287"> Madam Vicenova also referred to the agenda that has been, is and will live in a near time the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="288"> She described the Czech Presidency to two years ago of success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czech resolved the mounting financial crisis, the gas crisis or have held a Summit for a Partnership Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She described the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation to the EU is very busy at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of Madam Ambassador, &quot;the activity reached its full&quot; not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> It takes more approve the new budget septimal of the Union which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> As it would seem that the budget will be thin and for economies, the branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to resolve in the framework of future negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Madam Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels &quot;For a Europe understandable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I don&apos;t really like the abbreviations, the foreign words, that nobody understands dialects. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As must understand the citizens that it is true that nobody in Brussels the pickles round or twisted, of bananas differently or large although nobody has prohibited from making syrecky.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="298"> It to better use EU environment and see more of Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> A multi-speed Europe we expected </seg>
<seg id="300"> The Ambassador Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and of people who do things that in their negative than positive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Moreover it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is, she says, to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support for the Czech party. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to a Czech Presidency to success then stressed the force and the cooperation of the Visegrad group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, when the Poles come to me, the Magyar, the Slovak, the French said to me: &apos;Wow, what you do there, that is still the Visegrad Group?&quot; and it is not at all happy &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future it is hard for new rules on fiscal policy facing the member countries. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is prevailing multi-speed, rather than a &quot;new European Federation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the euro area and other outside of the area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> Firstly, it was said that cooperation among the countries that want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be many institutes of this type and there will be a two-speed Europe really&quot; is Mrs Vicenova. </seg>
<seg id="311"> From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only the member of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> History of a mark: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone should seek the word which is closer to the nearest IBM strategy, would be &quot;the long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and, since its establishment 100 years have elapsed. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;PENSE&apos;!&quot; became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived hundred years due to the fact that it was always true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more &quot;has delare for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A system well prepared </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with its employees as Bata in Czech Republic, the people of IBM were the only American among the first employees to be paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer or an employee consistently elegant and a well developed system of rewards to inventors and commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> In the same way IBM has a well developed system of relationships with the client. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since this will be a femme- Virginia Rometty, who should replace Palmisano to the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It is working with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, brain- storming online from what are many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas, in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is internal and external image of the company that provide a secure position in the areas of business. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than a firm institution technology,&quot; said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve the problems of the world of business using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of the Consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As said the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create the market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM, or the &quot;Big Blue,&quot; as it is colloquially in the United States with regard to its slogan- in 100 years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is obviously the most versatile technology firm, it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, counselling at the level of server products to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its discoveries ranks such as distributor of tickets, the card payment, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM has recovered this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview in advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all innovations and fabrications which were customer preference and IBM at the time-for example failed the bet on a system operational service&apos;s own OS/2, Prodige online or of the IBM computer PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain fixated on the past,&quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it is. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike example of conccurent Microsoft that the basis is and remains under the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> Income In the IBM, the services, which are trained to a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However still in 1990 it was with more than the motie of participation the highest representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000 IBM has sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion, over cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="351"> It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM negotiated according to the precepts of its first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without incident? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The price of the action IBM progesse from 2008 in rocket 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything, but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> It can expect for this that giant flexible control other crises. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM History: From the slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="358"> The IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City 100 years ago; it was originally the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>

<seg id="361"> They possessed of technologies such as the old &quot;pointeuses,&quot; clocks which recorded the arrival and departure of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint that until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of society. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The leader was then to shadow the founder of the firm, is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the society. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the firm kusqu&apos;en 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all machinery possible for business and trade, of cheese and meat slicers to cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years during which Watson led, turnover has multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was irreplaceable for the firm if that after 40 years of direction is her son who held the chair of Director, Thomas Watson Jr.. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership IBM began the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s people and the IBM computers helped NASA has guided the flights in the cosmos, on Mercury, Saturn and the flight on the Moon in 1969. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The PC classic which determined the standard computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM sells its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The successful strategy at IBM over the past three years, is the concept Smarter Planet &quot;smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its objective is the uilisation smart technology in areas not yet exploited such as the transport and management of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> Regarding trade IBM has developed some time ago a platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; trade that helps to manage the entire business cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM also has a strong history on our territory. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, also IBM RT, there is also the strategic center for outsourcing of Brno. </seg>

<seg id="382"> Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is finished. </seg>
<seg id="384"> After that her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return to the house. </seg>

<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepa can return home, but not as my partner,&quot; explained Rychtarova. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that the couple would not. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When Iveta after 30 days insisted move from Ricany, Pepa not only postponed the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> And it admitted in public that he loved him. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With the time Darina has resigned, accepted the binding of her husband and eventually to say goodbye forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If Rychtar and Bartosova split there will be no wife to the host on outside the door of the house. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;It is my son&apos;s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, nobody will be outside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,&quot; a leaked Rychtarova by showing that it is detached from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The fact that Darina had closed the door is not a problem for Joseph. </seg>

<seg id="403"> I know that it is my fault, I fell in love (&quot;Iveta and I take all the responsibility on me,&quot; said Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: This also for you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask men to identify defects typical of women, all alike, are able to get them out of their hole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear ladies, you know in the following lines of defects women arriving to pump the blood veins of men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Do you buy at least one garment per week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are simply buying and packet at the time of balances? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case you can speak of purchases as a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you say, which would to leche-vitrine in clothing stores, to seek for oneself fine clothing and then try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And although for most women buy is a hobby, it may become a hell for the man. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Remember only how many times have you said to your spouse that he expected at the entrance. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too big?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms, I should start to make the sport?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;I like you?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These sentences do not remind you something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> You are therefore part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> This is not the question that you should stop to look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still to complain about her appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex do not hesitate to say that increase the frequency of these complaints and more women become empoisonnantes. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The orders and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> Infinite It is like a merry-go-round. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Wash windows, vacuuming, clean soil, to dust, scraping the bathroom, and this twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You made the remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on own soil, the children they have soiled the sink, clogged the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> Should you have precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that it should not be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This innocent desire of cleanliness may spoil your relations, however, and even family peace. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The work to undermine </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Met the top spent in the dustbin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You accounts put these old socks again tomorrow?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;A wet towel has nothing to do with land.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you made on your partner this undermining of this way several times a day, you really break it down. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It is clear that you don&apos;t think about poorly you want everything is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps if men knew, women would not have to do so much work to undermine. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Defamation, the persiflage </seg>
<seg id="439"> Defamation, the persiflage but also the insults against someone is also a characteristic of some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are brought particularly in relations and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps each of us leak a small persiflage innocent here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The hand on the heart it is a feature of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise other and are for them, particularly to work in a group of women-particularly dangerous. </seg>

<seg id="448"> Jagr after the game said to journalists of types Giroux that he warned that it would be a great evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;I said before the game that he would give his hat-trick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I felt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Some time this sense you falls over&quot; said Jagr after its action Giroux was a goal of the first firing of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second attack of the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palet and presented the scorer Maxime Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a downhill, but the beginning of the second part fell to the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically to Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr McGee scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love playing with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I do not mean that he is the best player in the league but it really is part of the top three,&quot; said Jagr on the center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I never thought I&apos;d do in end career with a hokeyjiste as him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am really happy with it.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="471"> Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is the fact that the rear line was ill that has especially debt the entraineur local instead of points lost because they played the game with only five defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;It is nil.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest was youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing to be done, it is like that,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacement on replacement this was not sufficient and we could not resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We just to simplify the game, pushing the puck travels at speeds beyond our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> For this we had the limits, &quot;said one of the defenders P. K. Subban. </seg>

<seg id="480"> 5 different gunmen participated uax purposes of the Jets, who issued a series of five matches lost. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have evolved travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until Czechoslovakia in 1989 there were only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies at the time offering travel especially in countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists were traveling for the holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A large exception to the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a penchant for western and travel to the Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) travel individually even in the framework of socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In the case where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually by example in Poland and the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation or the individual trip was not authorized. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies at this time also offered tours to the West, however, should be queuing all night with a sleeping bag or have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after what was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the currency which was the condition for travel to the west was &quot;politically incorrect&quot; denied to people who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency exchangeable was not, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of Western currency (currency) to travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Czechs often spent their holidays in the country where there were so many country houses and cottages that Czechs are purchased, and this usually lasts until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travel of Czechs have since been since 1989 a major revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of vacation in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox which we do not realize now is that the country&apos;s most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave for short visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could not long travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example in Paris the Czechs travel organizations were sleeping in tents in parks because our income allowed us not to pay the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical feature of Czechs travel was at that time to win with itself its own food cans, sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna which has enabled our tourists finally after decades of Western power freely buy of the currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and the average salary increased which led around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Through a growing demand for travel travel agencies since 1997 began preparing for the towers with links by air charter which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of 90 years of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries of the world from the US who later facilitated our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting time in the history of post-revolution, when tourism was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as each year of direct air charter take of Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It is more than 100,000 Czechs alien who visit the country each year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Once an interesting time in this period which symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008 the US have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fall completely in the group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including annexes loads. Crowns per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President but it may end in a situation without &quot;a pat solution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> Nearly 5mois already Czech football is without President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly scheduled to take place Thursday at Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> However there is still no agreement on the settlement of vote is required. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned in June and during his departure urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to the differences between the chambers of the Association which cannot agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This has fully shown on 16 September when it had to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and it was not even issue to deal with how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There was no agreement on the fact of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly, only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this time also with the assistance of the Office for the state and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Differences continue about the regulation on the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is clear too that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned negotiation or extraordinary, is not made either to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> Opinions on the possibilite of vote have changed several times, but the key point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed to the third round not to fall in the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is in the following fact: follow the statutes or find another model,&quot; was one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the model planned won the third round the candidates who received the highest number of votes in proportion to the Chamber to which he or she is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw in order that is the candidate who receives the largest percentage of votes in both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech part is the requirement that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely refuse the bicameral concept,&quot; says Svoboda that includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agree even if it considers that the regulation of elections based on the articles most Pelta advantage among all candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Than I would like to vote according to the statutes of the association &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;For that there is not yet a whimsical ideas conceived by a representative as in past General Assembly,&quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and in its submissions was defined primarily against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The qualification possible today in European Championship should calm everyone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there one more more excitement for a cooperation,&quot; says the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest football management experience in both professional and at the regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are patterns to change the regulations to design.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may lead to new a blockage in the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope that the healthy reason will win&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some reuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell whether the entire leadership of football will be full for the match. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The specially chartered flight in which should travel to Podgorice inter alia the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not departed for technical reasons and sought an alternative to take a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At the end is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parties torn in the strongest sports association of the countries and bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there are many: a state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports which is to determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because it sees no candidate correct. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that the profile would have responded to everything that he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaign to this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such a candidate, &quot;said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (CTK). </seg>
<seg id="552"> Paclik&apos;s motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent precisely Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which in principle would be given favorite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik also points out that if under the elections would be held the position of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> It would be well in the service an experienced manager and of high-level but is not linked to the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have discussed with people who have the profile,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football at this time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change this image,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> This, it is said, is especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and President of the Union regional football of Plzen Roman Berbr, rights to the controversial reputation that is known in the scenes as lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates to the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of high-powered Berbr, which is a merchant, it would be even less favourable to football,&quot; proclaimed Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What the shocks still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced in tapping a few years ago as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta was left without any penalty. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know what prestige Pelta would football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we be regarded in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the should Paclik triumph to Thursday&apos;s vote, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which ended in a fiasco, think the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;It has large capacity&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;It would be able to present such as head of the representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as manager of the Association would not be able.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose in what I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Paclik which attracted great attention in September when it agreed to the cancellation of the Referees Commission with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik states that it would be at the level to lead the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also heads since last year the club of Plzen who celebrated with his support in May its triumph in first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I freinerais the influence of certain interest groups that have for example tend to affect the Disciplinary and Appeals, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; said Paclik that chache not its antipathy to the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with high-level policy would provide more money for the sport of tax on the games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key points of the new President should be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not present its link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he claims that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above the parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> I see no reason to give my club Plzen&apos;s actions to someone if I must return a year and a half after, &quot;said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to situations of pat. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Association football one of the candidate to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should end in the future to disputes about the rules for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The employee of Jablonec is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe today that the success of the football representation should calm this squabble before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election in September which has not carried out promised precisely to focus on the national representation and access to financial resources if it is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and the delay of two months might enable him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels of football are long and expect Thursday there is a President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association,&quot; he adds, but it is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> It is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that existed at sought to Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately the&quot; General Assembly of June of statutes were approved which were not perfect as all realized.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there were not these various interpretattions we already had a president since September,&quot; Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is precisely the review the most important document of the civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in the case where it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then tries, it is said, not to face its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said previously that it may cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl it recognizes with respect to its training in law and that it knows that its adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It has not attacked long Tonas Paclik which on the contrary continues to criticize Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It evolves in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were not the most honorable and has surprised many people during the campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;It is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; Pelta said in the address of his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the declarations he made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its the greatest weapon he stated is his knowledge of football competition from the lowest level to the national representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a vitirne football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> And also I would endeavor to complete all cases that begin with that of Bohémians or following the scandal of corruption.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I entrerais immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for any football,&quot; told the Czech News Agency CTK reported the 46th candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also added that his appointment to the head of the football would not change for people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should meet with all employees,&quot; he said at Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there is catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he said that the delegates will not Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If there is a single point of discord over how to vote in the third round we will be able to surpass.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and it will not get that when there is a new leader at its head,&quot; as the states of optimistically Pelta two days before the decisive day probably for his career as a public servant. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot;If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday it would not resonate with many people, it seems. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, however, that in the case where it would be elected will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It is systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It also promised to resolve the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA soccer, make more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President I want to play football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation, of professional football and a successful football youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I am not saying that I will do this only&quot; Rajchl said in an interview for KTC. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and want to distribute the expertise within the Executive Committee so that each member is responsible for a specific area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will hand out difficult missions for football face a major step forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;A lot of people will not be happy, because it will be hard to begin work rather than criticize others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It reported, said, that he would not stand again as a candidate because of a critical mood. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;A about me, you know that I work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know if this is the time and if I have the people behind me that I will constantly sticks in the wheel and issue of doubts on each of my actions,&quot; explaining why he was afraid. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;A lot of people have said to me that I must not give up because they would also.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is a confidence that I cannot betray,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates the, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Over the last two years there has been a lot of fact and I do not want to let him down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes which have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stop.&apos;,&quot; he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does as it was before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic work and it is something that Mirek Pelta is not do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been selected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;I can blame a number of things but certainly not to bear quelq&apos;un.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to make football for all because everyone will be pleased not only those who have been selected </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms once again that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum to Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian the other which the winners would be in first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;There would be no situation as now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is to find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances of winning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel permanently support of the Czech Chamber which elected me as its Executive Vice President and knows that with me there will be success,&quot; said Rajchl considering among its future success to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiation of contracts with televisions and on the Gaming Act. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It said instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While said about Pelta &quot;it is disqualified as the Czech footblal would lose its credibility,&quot; he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate with which to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can doubt in Plzen this year he did a superb job.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If he was elected he would surely continue in what has been started by Hasek and make no significant change among people in the Committees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;It did not wish to waste its success&quot; said Rajchl which has assessed its rivals. </seg>

<seg id="659"> It is irritating that the supporters of swimming should simply look of blue tiles and cope with the stench of the bleach while the joggers breathe the spellbinding fragrance of spruce forests or can listen to gazouillement happy bird park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I requested a day why pools must in fact be always so ugly&quot; said the Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;Therefore I started a collection of beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> Surface water strengthens doubling the architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oil, factor of well-being in the swimming areas are huge because all sense are awake, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if builders would have given a little more of penalty, the rooms to swim could be a real delicacy for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor was a surface water in the rooms of swimming.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;It is transparent on one side, but on the other hand, however, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All surfaces are optically in a double way: vaults high, colorful tiles, platforms. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The volume of image of small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; is a report of interest 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the historic oasis of well-being, it is certainly wish to make a leap into the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> In addition of well-being splendid baths as the bath Széchenyi aged 100 years in Budapest, she found the water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst cave (bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths, pools are filled with water containing the alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building in a bottle. </seg>
<seg id="670"> However, outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a roof of the bath of Zurich was the entire town to its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snowy from a pool of external St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which to observe the animation on the ski track. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design looks swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI just landing on the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> In winter, steam rising from three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> Smell of bleach is not of all pools of the collection Meder. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths from a smell of sulphur, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin when you let slip in the pool, a spa experience special. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During its pursuit of beautiful pools, Iris Meder was also the subject of disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, it was found in a ground barricaded. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath designed by the architeque Du¨an Jurkovic in 1902 was now closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> In casting a glance through the window of the immeuble-Art New in rouge-blanc-jaune, it noted the development of weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> It observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of baths of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only of elements neo-romains leaving since its inception in 1844 but Moorish room in Alhambra style that has been added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace remains the favorite of the bath expert in thermal pool, Iris Meder, and not only because it is from Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It is already a fine performance that of melt construction if different styles in a unit so great,&quot; said Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue. </seg>

<seg id="690"> In January, the head of the group in order to draw the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg, </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a survey, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that the banks are speculating on the raw materials such as corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this Avenue business because it increases the problems of the poorest countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann stressed in this article that speculation Awards on the global commodities, pushing prices upwards and the banks share complicity to world hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The consumer protection campaign aligns specifically against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But the majority of experts share the opinion that the bettors have since posted offers and requests, and benefit at the expense of the very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann responded to criticism from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, &quot;no case is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently reviewing the charges of Foodwatch-Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank results must be submitted, with recommendation, usually. </seg>
<seg id="703"> In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn. </seg>
<seg id="704"> It could result in a reduction of the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann built its Image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Speculation on the rising price of food shows in a draconian manner, to how the banks of today are detrimental to the public interest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation. today </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank should remove all of its investment portfolio, for which the money has been invested on the food speculation,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It is irrelevant, for Mr Ackermann, if it was a question of people hungry or if Deutsche Bank&apos;s reputation is at stake.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the President of the Council of Administration will not change to what is provided for in the Council of Administration. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Ll could improve its image with a controversial abandonment of agricultural speculation. </seg>

<seg id="714"> A on two would terminate the investments on the raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization&apos;s campaign. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people. </seg>

<seg id="721"> 21st home in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion which moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> On Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is open to new and place of home exposure. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its glass sheds, its bright, bold patterns and new construction materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progress, the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pavilion of Schwanzer was once the &quot;Grand Prix Architecture&quot; for its construction steel and glass, slight and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Construction is considered to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> It made the architects so famous, he has also built the following Austrian Pavilion for Expo. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in form of bowl in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the Expo in the Garden Switzerland to the station south of Vienna, was transformed, and a museum of 20th century opened in 1962, </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was not physically or technically suitable for a museum, not of walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However it was also long used, until &quot;that contemporary art is a new building in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and was increasingly dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as the &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, which the house belongs, the first exhibition, a stroke of luck to any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new departure was carried out by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new Director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian with a significant career between other in his youth of figure skater, subsequently in Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has completed particularly the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, it received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation is the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookstore there, and a room must be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Monitoring strict, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For achieving Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the flag was &quot;an extremely important place&quot; where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; exposures. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, who lost in generosity and light following his visit to Vienna and by a change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> During the current changes, there were major problems: the building was &quot;a chasm in energy,&quot; said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of facade windows were changed, of glass fiber glass insulation strengthened was asked and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled with asbestos coatings have been rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have made way for the new operation, a sign of subdued light between the house and the road lighting, provides a bridge leading to the entrance, is almost a new construction, but always the slight Pavilion Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a color protection against rust red-brown color. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the movie theater is exactly identical to what it once was. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all under close supervision of authorities competent for the monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Materials that are often good and cheap should be found, and that appeal also to the Office of Protection monuments,&quot; said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a ground gross in basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, the issues and transformations, the &quot;building remained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot;which came from Brussels,&quot; said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of &quot;Drop-in-the-City.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;awaken the conscience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the &quot;Central Station&quot; newly planned neighborhood, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck may occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the center of Berlin temporary art, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland. </seg>

<seg id="758"> Railway Society has developed a plan-crise, which aims to prevent the train accidents in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The number of employees should double. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and the delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn &quot;in this regard will spend more than 70 million this year. </seg>

<seg id="764"> The number of internal and external employees to remove snow from the railway facilities and docks should among other double and move to 16,000 persons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The objective is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of track equipment necessary to service within four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago the Chief station Rüdiger Grube cautioned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents also this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter Railway society has had a lot of problems for the transport d &quot;users, because it lacks one of reserves in case of severe weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> It is as many new regional trains were for years awaiting authorisation from the Ministry of Railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The railway company has for years of what to do, since it has to verify the axles of ICE trains more often to the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at the main railway station in Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German bank Deutsche Bank &quot;pays millions of penalties in the US. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the head Josef Ackermann case there&apos;s new to the US: the German bank Deutsche Bank &quot;must pay a fine s&quot; to the tune of millions. </seg>

<seg id="775"> The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to large banks a series of charges, and that of inducing the cooperative banks to make false promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they have minimized the risk. </seg>
<seg id="776"> These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and led the banks down. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are satisfied, we could find a solution to this issue, and that the parties begin proceedings in court,&quot; said a representative of Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank recognized in comparison no fault. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This is valid also for the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of an amount of $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks of the USA and intervenes in cases of bankruptcy, to protect the deposits of customers. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred to billions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Comparisons made now are the first of their kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator also took other major banks to party and in summer it has brought before the Court JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is of &quot;Mortgage-backed Securities.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="789"> Although the events are already a few years old, at the present time it blows on the US banks a wind storm. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and the supervisory authorities have brought many remedies for redress or to punish breaches. </seg>

<seg id="800"> It has, however, read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> It had already realized much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of char in the world of finance. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Therefore IT activity IBM gives itself the right to call themselves to this &quot;Mr IBM.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="810"> The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation that very powerful business computers. </seg>

<seg id="826"> The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Following this new, Turkey as well as the population German-Turkish reacts with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> German-Turkish For much of the spectrum long thought dead rebuilt its appearance: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has not been a comparable with this context right-wing extremist violence against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Let there be a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been discussed. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals the scale of the dimension is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Is a return to the bloody ideology,&quot; &quot;This was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily&quot; Haberturk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; points out that one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned at the fact that the German authorities may be involved in the quagmire of extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is in a reasoned manner that responded the Turkish community in Germany: it called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought about a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a slap: &quot;the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the platform turque- &quot;Haber X,&quot; which refers to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> As the German publication of &quot;Hürriyet&quot; has no compunction to draw clear conditions. </seg>

<seg id="839"> There points out that people have been murdered, have paid taxes and contributed by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The action of the police was seen very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it has not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to make research in some circles suspect right-wing, are surprised the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than one is ready for less drastic means or rhetoric: &quot;If the case continues to be botched, it will remain the migrants nothing other than self-defence and the weapons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;It will be the best self-defence.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="845"> What it means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in memory German and Turkish. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown more clearly to Turks living here that there is a real threat, and the Germans, on which the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could result. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks, however, have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> Once it is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by its Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-turcs is local to the &quot;rule of law since this date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is necessary this time. </seg>

<seg id="865"> A merchant of titles of UBS in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had flambé about 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The Chief of the Board of Directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker well-known not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is regarded since as with, and all are asking: When Axel Weber is finally? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the Executive Presidency already in May, not in 2013, as the bank reported Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber that becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> There is no banker, much more Professor d &quot;economy and President of the bank, and he was certainly need an adjustment period. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly it assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of &quot;the largest bank to scandal in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is an enormous side, until recently, it was the world&apos;s largest asset manager, and on the other, it patina for years from one scandal to another. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, the savings if proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> This began during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image the Swiss asset manager, silent and sound, but also shrewd, it had combined with the ambitious goals: it also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So the UBS managed a side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, it had advanced as investment bank in the league of the world&apos;s largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made sense. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: &quot;I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank to my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;In the current context, we wonder: how is it that I could simply I am wrong at this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It is deeply wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was not right to the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> By mid-year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in surprising ways, which had hitherto been perceived as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later it approached why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had singed with sub-prime documents and had to cross on billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this she actually found of investors, but shortly before, have fronce eyebrows: a state fund Asian non-transparent from Singapore and a bottom of Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This n &quot;was the first time. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank was to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Governing Council chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the highest-paid second board of Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought to the UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Any Switzerland has been shaken, as she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to host such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 s &quot;rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We could not save the UBS once again,&quot; said the researcher of banks, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster it is followed by the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months before, the UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with the United States and was ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who defrauded the tax possibly with the assistance of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million, for repayment of unjustified profits from those operations with a fine plus. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus the UBS has more or less published that she had helped the evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Governing Council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And of the exodus of clients&apos; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business lines: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of assistance to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as it did, that the UBS in would, it was to this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single market of 1.7 billion euros as flared, before the bank was aware that something was not right. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And be published: with risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to function. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli, it was found that the control of risks to too little changed,&quot; said Martin Janssen, bank economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a major German bank was safe: &quot;the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of risks in hand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their function, that of become guardian of the vast wealth of the world: not too many risks, but security for money, and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of a strong reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a chocolate particularly noble. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The Central of the UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong image of the Swiss private bank, it is only slightly larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in the central station of Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are prestigious, retail rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The jewellers as Tiffany&apos;s, are found here between stores of Swiss traditions like those of the confectionery Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries of Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It is in the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are lined with marble, which are thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for &quot;safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the client research here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank has one day away from the market, or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank found. </seg>
<seg id="923"> It would prefer not read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers it also does business with the two major banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS would become too large, trouve-t&apos;il, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would be further spread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss have nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And even though they have long been adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon which changed the investment bank UBS, has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the large Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The crash of the UBS.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to about 68 billion francs, or EUR 45 billion, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the large bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If spoke with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two of three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was established, which was already too large for the little Switzerland, and has been constantly increasing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What helped was that both banks predecesseuses different from the UBS completed: a rich, but lethargy with bank as strong point Asset Management in Zurich and a poor, but already more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the international investment banks were favourable access to lots of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel as a dream team,&quot; said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, that it is very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, which has found its way to the top with learning of the bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would have used up &quot;at the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli probably would have committed a critical mistake at the end: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;It is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> -- Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Staff of the UBS remembers clearly rallies of leaders during which the leader of the group Wuffli always gave the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US bank was the world&apos;s most powerful investment bank. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It commissioned the &quot;League tables&quot; ratings, which have documented the success of banks at that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all the UBS wanted to start at the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> The business advisers, who had the responsibility, have pointed out a weakness: in the international operations of interest, in banking jargon &quot;Fixed Income,&quot; there is a huge difference compared to larger banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS would have gaps in the products of American mortgages. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, the UBS has launched into an adventure, which has almost cost him his life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Assoiffés of growth, it is both the bank itself that a substantive management established before it in the American sub-prime investments which have invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It was transformed into a massive machine that is packaged and placed the documents of value based on US mortgages, but that risk has also retained. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks has long sought to descend. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Again in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was in flames, the UBS bought here,&quot; said Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> More euphoria is much more the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after the other had to go, when to put an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions in UBS became ejection and are so far bancaux. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the major bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all business models suggested disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The bank researcher, Geiger has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of property, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not (yet) go as far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank must shrink strongly, so that this is clear up &quot;at present. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday the bank head Sergio Ermotti to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Italo-suisse aged 51 was only supposed to be temporary when the bank was separated with surprise of his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, it emerged: it must sustain the business of UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti to reduce the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What wants to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that &quot;Axel Weber has certainly already raised. </seg>
<seg id="976"> It publicly said so far only that he would seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> The fear of a recession in Europe weighed on the American Stock Exchange </seg>
<seg id="979"> The threat of a recession in Europe by end of week has discouraged investors. American </seg>
<seg id="980"> The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Industrial production contained on the continent has stifled the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its seeds. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens was unable to impose. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The euro fell against the dollar. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Glass Italian and Greek I still the last week to half full, not half empty, but now the problems are once again at the forefront, &quot;said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott. </seg>

<seg id="992"> As announced by the statistical office Eurostat, the companies produced in September, 2% less than in the month before. </seg>
<seg id="993"> American investors have expressed in a manner sceptical: &quot;We are not an island, however dependent,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe will not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: &quot;is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,&quot; he said in an interview on CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, in his view it was too early to invest in bonds from the statements and European banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead, Warren Buffett threw a principle dating back several decades to winds and entered the U.S. technology industry </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Crows smart spread in cities </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places, the rooks are considered &quot;problem bird.&quot; But the experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer hunt of cities for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some like them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents&apos; complaints are increasing due to dirt and noise of animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> A antidote to the &quot;° bird problem&quot; is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> In the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to hunt the rooks of cities. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The experts from across Germany deliberated on the possible solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They seek alternatives in the cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> The protective of the problems of cities nature based also on the exodus of rooks particularly protected: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroy traditional vital areas. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Hunting, the development and logging of brooding typical made life difficult for birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows are under the protection of the nature. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large settlements with more than 600 pairs breeding in the westfalischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics found the bird trapping in traps and their particularly brutal killing with clubs. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Normal &quot;Expulsion, the ousted, serves no purpose,&quot; said the planner and landscape of the city of Leer, Werner Klöver. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The destruction of nests using water pressure or cut down trees, often produces unintended consequences, said the environment expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;Animals is away, the large colonies are and they disperse in other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> L &quot;ousting is conceivable only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We are obliged to live with them, we cannot kill them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Concevable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a packaging aversif and eye-catching offers, so as to enable them to resettle elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospectait &quot;of info panels in place of completely different chainsaws&quot; to establish relations with: &quot;We finally can better withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the lives of these highly intelligent rooks. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This project has since been adopted by the tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: &quot;This is a large number of communication, these birds have a lot to say.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The rooks use not only of working tools to reach a treat but they manufacture their own tools as instruments of work. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The éthologistes at Cambridge University tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to be down scaffolding with stones to arrive at a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without a lot of training, they recognized determinement that a stone had some size and shape to collapse the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second test, clever crows had to solve a problem more stocky. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Birds could not achieve their booty with their bill. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers had set pieces of wire to them. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals formed a hook with the assistance which they fished the small bucket of small pipe. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four rooks are even managed from the beginning. </seg>

<seg id="1265"> There are few known names, the major treaties or of famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on the strategies and the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, that &quot;a book describing to what looked like.&quot; They include &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow&quot; summarizes the wartime experiences of more or less ordinary, 20 men and women on both sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, through doctors, ambulance drivers and vendors. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war. Some will lose of members, will become insane or lose life. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives wavering here as the candles of a church: while some off, it renewed conflict of new. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is a lie to the idea that the First World War is not by the terrible war in the trenches on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow&quot; ably described other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and the East Africa. </seg>

<seg id="1277"> When of cannon shots heard in the distance, and you&apos;re a stay-at-home mom, you stay or evade you? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who will anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Peter Englund, &quot;the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, of the hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, of dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are derived mainly from briefs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details isolated. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most address the deprivation and the ability to get. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;Ersatz, around ersatz.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Coffee replacement, forged aluminum, rubber imitation wood paper, bandages, buttons.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1289"> It asserts that &quot;authorized 837 alternative meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 cafes alternative.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories address the honor and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes its own drive to the savagery and said about the war: &quot;You feel that after all, that is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky to the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than argue that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your formal shirt and cloutee. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no person or the note will pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> It is unfortunately rather comparable to &quot;a condemned man strangled in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other comments related to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition,&quot; writes Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the plants.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It takes the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species within the broad mass of the beginning of the century: the murderer well-articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing well cut, which performs its beef while seated behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People act of unexpectedly; there are so many basic behavior that heroism. </seg>

<seg id="1301"> &quot;The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blind for life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has &quot;triggered the uncontrollable forces exclusively: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People begin to wonder why their leaders a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best literature on the First World War are often indirect, such as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (The Great War and Modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or &quot;A western nothing new,&quot; Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The work of Peter Englund is a little conventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I read in a work non-fictionnelle. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I will reveal not to do the. </seg>

<seg id="1320"> The last training session took place Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to travel in the park are managed &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said a used, referring to the operation as &quot;a simple exercise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few officers I know and were called did not know they would go in Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person who anonymously. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only that they make are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The city has retained a lesson, to where the secrecy of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, the police wanted to clean the park but were made against hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Operation of Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces of the whole neighborhood, dozens of officers accustomed to neighborhoods particularly criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people were and were in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. An hour of the morning was a favourable time. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It should take place when the park had the least of people&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Emergency Services vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and resounding recorded messages of speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While in community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue jackets, many demonstrators have simply collected their business and are parties. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No attempts were affected before 1h45 said the police, which left the occupants time to collect their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists present within the park have been forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that the action had been taken solely by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But according to many journalists, the police would be unable to monitor the response within the park, roughly selected by the officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture the images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While Police moved west through the thick jumble of cases of demonstrators, including the baggage of leaves, grass and plastic bags filled with clothing, teams from the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A dozen people located at the epicentre of the camp are hooked together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people were chained to trees, &quot;said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The emergency services were called to cut the lock. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests took place in the park before three-thirty Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to the Police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most for &quot;violating public order and rebellion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer to s &quot;be found on the site. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department of detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although this, &quot;does not lead the operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of police patientaient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It saw the Police broaden the perimeter beyond Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing from people. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Almost 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the most serious of the night took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Towards 5.00 AM, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the top of a police car. Others were seen in the process to clear the tires of a police truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At a time, a piece of plywood has arisen in driving the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to institute Wednesday a lawsuit against the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissal. The impact is disproportionate on schools for disadvantaged students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to overturn the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, part of the city paid less, have lost their employment on 7 October last. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not leaving the city access to a health care fund led by groups of workers, and which would have made it possible to close the budget gap last spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities categorically denied the accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget ended in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member Council responded, indicating that the layoffs of school aid n &quot;were not specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officers of the 37th District Council said that they would notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be continued; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis M. Walcott and the department of the Education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off women workers, all of them black or of Latin American origin, as most of the school aid who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city&apos;s legal department, said that the municipality has not been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union will build on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most regular aid due to under-funding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and some barely in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of southern neighborhoods of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employees at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of children live in poverty, the prosecution claim that &quot;This is not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring in money to bridge the budget gap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the &quot;Public School 36 was reduced to 3.26 percent this year. Funds were also lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry (&quot; disadvantaged student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also claims that managers of schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo employed the term &quot;overtaking&quot; to describe the action, even though &quot;overtaking&quot; described more generally the action of moving a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the draft complaints, &quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents have been laid off, and&quot; not only because of exceedance &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed: the Congress reach an agreement on the issue of Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems finally that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took a successful uprising, the capture and the death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, Independent, Connecticut, applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their &quot;courage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honor the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may be innocent but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margins and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day of the failure of the draft law, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> US mission therefore remained in a form of purgatory, the legislative Congress upset enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under the feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecisiveness of the Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission of NATO officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Foreign Relations Committee&apos;s resolution &quot;congratulates the Libyan people for his extraordinary courage and determination for freedom&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and great professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also affirms &quot;the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Does new will enjoy the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or divide as legislators in June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Senator and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in the Congress, and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlatte&apos;s amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been submitted to the Congress, on a wide range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurring, the same draft law proposed in both the House and the Senate, and others are of slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 in the House only versions of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who &quot;control federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but give their support, including the new Republicans who want to gild their CVs, the chance of boast to be the &quot;author&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) approved in August asked the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators have voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat, New York) to lift the limit of two terms for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is constantly proposed, as the amendment banning desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As eager as were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slows compared with the early 1990s, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments had not much more success than they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added, the 27th, was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Massacrée but not beaten,&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords television in his first interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat (Arizona) emerged Monday evening in a television broadcast, sang &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; Broadway and said they want to restore rather than return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> During his appearance in the news &quot;20/20&quot; on the ABC television channel, with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> L &quot;show has touched his return difficult following the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and described her recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After that Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, responded &quot;rather well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was held at a special one-hour edition of &quot;20/20,&quot; issued on the eve of the release of the couple&apos;s new book &quot;Gabby: a story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> L &quot;special program traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting incident on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, being seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is seated in a wheelchair while the doctors to learn to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A sign of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A movement of lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, his first word: &quot;What.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) to seek to change the menu of his breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: is the Representative in singing with physicians air of Cyndi Lauper Girls &quot;Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty &quot;Free Fallin&quot;? &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, did not remember the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, it was currently to read an article on the shooting of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed during the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and strongly treaty pending the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> There has been a lot of deaths, &quot;said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Dur, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During his recovery, &quot;said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, said,&quot; I was beaten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I would say, &apos;Gabby, you have not been beaten,&quot; said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you&apos;re out, you restore and come back even stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More pity than respect for the troops </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala to Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the city of New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, the frustration and the loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in costume-cravate has been standing on its feet for the cheering. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The military, men and women, are considered heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A haut-grade military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the United States, saw the role of troops in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They were presented as a kind of orphan,&quot; the military haut-grade wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it &quot;was not the respect. Just of compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Impressions absolutely contradictory illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the military and an American public passionate but often distant. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Praise are provided to troops for their sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say some military. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public increasingly acts as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all the victims,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it would appear that the only way to support us or we lock in the role of hapless minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> It is a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who do not wish to seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the anger of returners troops of the Vietnam War was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most conversations about the pity are held in confidence among the veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of its two sons of combat with the Marines, the retired colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would watch with respect because they have been faced with insurgents and traveled to remote locations. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Other will consider if a veteran &quot;angry and violent lurks under the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work the Government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who had passed the interviews for subtle way it would be able to cope with the stress of a job requiring to Washington immediately after his return from combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you raise the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions,&quot; said Colonel Cancian when he spoke to his son. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The victories are rarely pleased by a country also unfamiliar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same manner as for the Second World War,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people focus heavily on the depth of suffering of a military. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops are recognized for the number of endured periods of service, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army face increasing pressure to punish rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Capital this week, a hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier of 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and pregnant for 11 weeks the night she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> C &quot;was in October 2008 and returned to its barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a fellow carrying a pack of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;C&quot; was a warning signal, &quot;said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texane has set aside its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, it has 19 years. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is Texas,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I had to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, thrown by land and raped, she claimed. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, wait with anxiety the decision of Justice at a landmark trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> These are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Located in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved initially 17 Complainants. This number amounted to 28 the following month, 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted and justice provided adjusted after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke said attacking military galonnees, because the problem begins with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people in position&quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Counsel also submits that since the month of February, it was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants in this case, putting all its eggs in the same basket, it will initiate several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to 1950 a decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Claimed &quot;The evil is inherent in the military service of complainants&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused to make any comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is included only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are seldom all-male. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, including to come into contact with local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives, two thirds in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> It is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in most of its own. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> A l &quot;Yale Law School, the center of legal services veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorders&quot; awarded to victims of rape to give leave-a relatively regular, according to the activists as Anu Bhagwaru the Service Women&apos;s Action Network (military), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, by accusing them of discriminatory practices in the treatment of requests for benefits for persons who have been victims of sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine draft law independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing different solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded from the center of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon&apos;s own estimate, this represents approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report released in March also studies the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20 percent of registered cases in the army have been the subject of a trial, half the percentage of the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The complainants in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, it informed the military police of rape less than an hour after the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she said, asked about 11 times in detail his rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She underwent a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and the assailant&apos;s blood, due to a cut to his arm, was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is seated before a judge, in a trial in which the questions on sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of the assault. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day the verdict was delivered,&quot; says Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to begin to have contractions. I started yelling at the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer&quot; This was not a trial but the mine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnosing a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was dismissed under the terms less than honorable, preventing him from receiving benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Does the case Lyman and other complainants argue or not, it is a long story, said John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he noted, &quot;In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticized the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important they are trying,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These change only when the good have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, with its hundreds of other complainants to other trials. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as there will be no reform&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where up &quot;to what we were, one or the other of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: the researchers you are on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy making its anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, who has admitted having been taken to a murderous folly in Norway in July allowing 77 victims, was facing its first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy. Connect you on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that&quot; it was not that difficult to find them, &quot;said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the Reflection Group of DEMOS on digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is full of such personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the site&apos;s advertising tool to find the people they need with scientific precision, the way marketers have been doing it for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> L &quot;team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It has targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, advertisements invited users to complete a survey. The questions were related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> In coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to examine 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries, without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a new way of doing research,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young people and against immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &quot;those that combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> L &quot;study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to consider all issues affecting health issues as social trends, with &quot;I love,&quot; published on the walls and updates of statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add three contained on average per day, the data &quot;supernova&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the past five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of people that you may not be in the streets. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you try to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to go to the party, but you were never allowed to enter,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoided this, you have direct access to their information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and to address the health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits intoxicated were significantly more likely to be alcoholic that students quiet about. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggested that colleagues of the students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status speak too often alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You cannot address a problem if you do not,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the diagnosed Megan Moreno and Director of the Centre for health, behavior and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and in another case that would not be recognized.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly access to information of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> L &quot;team of the site which is considered the statistical data concerning the situation of love and the day of Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to digital information available, only the champions of freedom have for long argued that the site could make its wealth of data available to others for research purposes). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But of Facebook users know that the site notes, that they like or not, in exchange to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is authorized to have access to your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when the users of Facebook are part of a survey that they had not even heard? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information otherwise than through the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a study of 2006 it conducted in observing the Facebook walls of its students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to determine the extent of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Facebook &apos;What you say and what you do in reality are two completely different things, &quot;says Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> This is why, despite its technological experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social studies are intended to address the social aspect, and the social, it is not to a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Refrigeration and inhuman&quot;: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a &quot;resistance fighter&quot; in his first appearance at the trial which takes place in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and of the Temple of Norway,&quot; he said in a courtroom filled with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;With regard to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, I reject, because you keep your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue because it &quot;did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express their views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Judge Nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody 12 more weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> A 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I found cold and inhuman&quot; said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;I n&quot; was not comfortable, but I personally am a little advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eye in entering and leaving the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad movement of &quot;resistance,&quot; the judge determined that he was not crazy. It also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The of 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which perhaps will cheer him in some. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I preferred that it resembles a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 from the interview lost to Steve Jobs, the film this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October last, some have compared to Henry Ford, characterised by the engineering and inventor of the modern computer. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what fans of Apple may find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It is identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeder of charts, a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from a &quot;disease their suggesting that a great idea is 90% of the work... (but) a considerable amount of manual work between a great idea for a product of exception.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds.&quot; This series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and unusual conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At this time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a People&apos;s adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in the transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly rebound, is the film of 68 minutes, &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone of known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs appears surprisingly enthusiastic here to provide technological philosophies and its business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly close. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the issues, between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly its thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There were also times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where it seems eager to hear the issues of Cringely, giving the shots to contend for the accelerate and move to issues or issues of utmost importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Shot before the &quot;era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other businesses and is part of its own vision on the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of gross and lines on the rights that we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of the magnitude. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It has a vision on how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> It is then put on using them. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequence of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On how he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During all these years, I have always asked: Why do you do things?&quot; and the answers are always the same: &apos;oh, simply because we need them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why, no one thought in depth to things in a company. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs continues providing details on its efforts to simplify the accounting for Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Perplexed on how the costs were registered, it is often by a &quot;standard&quot; valued at cost to nose, then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; -- he has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the accurate calculation of trade costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the opportunity to play a round to Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;Blue Box&quot; he created with Steve Wozniak, a device that was used to hack the phone networks and call free in long-range. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device has been the subject of many written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, through an appeal and by connecting to a network AT&amp;T satellite to another while avoiding as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you arrived a minute later to the adjoining public telephone,&quot; Jobs says with a laugh. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and through the Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves able to control billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We both know little, but we have created a small thing able to control things. This was an incredible lesson, and I don&apos;t think one day that Apple would have existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go on laughter just before the Pope himself is woken up. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On his love with technology (canvassing and Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, to hunting for spare parts to manufacture a frequencemetre, it seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and to pass a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs is a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This has had a remarkable impact on me. C&quot; was the only company that I&apos;d seen to that age and it brought my definition of a business and how employees are treated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs subsequently became one of HP employees to visit the company&apos;s research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the &quot;first desktop computer ever conceived.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as large as a suitcase, had a small tubes. I have fallen in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Adolescents that j &quot;was returned with HP and began to write programs for the machine. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvisation of innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> A several times in the interview, Steve Jobs spoke to invent new products on a whim. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working to only 30 days of credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember big disputes... I am shouting above by claiming that it will take five years (to make a mouse that cost $300). I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15 and which was incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Of the large companies that are faltering: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would fail and lose control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;If you worked for IBM and Xerox, you better copier and printer, and after?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company did not meet more than success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can evolve, therefore (these are the types of people) that will eventually run the companies and personnel specialized in product are set to the &quot;gap of decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product engineering that led to this monopoly is completely rotten by those who cannot imagine design a good product from a bad product, the manual work required. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold the whole computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could make 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They uprooted the defeat to the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A huge amount of manual work between a great idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot on its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are tradeoffs. Some things you cannot do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the plants also. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. It is to try to present the best products that men have created, and to try to make these things to the product that you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso once said that the good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We always ashamed of fly of excellent ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> This is partly what makes exceptional Macintosh. The people working on it were musicians, poets, the zoologists, historians, who have simply been the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If there is for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas provided with lunch opponents of the health law while the court meets </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the question of political discord, namely if the opposition to President Obama&apos;s law of health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of these cases involved a lawsuit by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by the Congress last year, legislation that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5 1/2 is due in March, and the result is likely to be conducive to the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be growing at the time of the court&apos;s decision will be made. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Counsel to be held before the court and argumentera on the rejection of the law, is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Society Fédéraliste (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another proponent was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> If included, among others, Mitch McConnell, Senate&apos;s top Republican and opponent said of the health law. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Guests the featured dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Society Fédéraliste for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: &quot;A judge may assist in fund-raising organizations linked to law and other although the judge cannot be a participant, a guest of honor, or on the program of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas to close to two law firms in the case, as well as a massive enterprise with a financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court shall respect the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;Judges drank and were having dinner and a gala fundraising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the Court with the agenda of groups such as the Society Fédéraliste. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&apos;s wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist of haut-profil. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Furthermore, the Conservatives argue that it is the Justice Elena Kagan has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were raised in the court of first instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have lobbied for Kagan withdraws to hear the case, saying it was too invested in defense of the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan gave no indication that it would do so. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing has a control record $18 billion for aircraft line </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 aircraft of bi-couloirs line, with the option to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There is nothing extraordinary in what a company receives an order looking 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> This is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that the amount of these 50 had reached an all-time high of $18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally incredible is that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will be needed in the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history, 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this pharaonic control. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced the Aerospace Show in Dubai in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order of $26 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model which boasts significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six aircraft s &quot;amounts to more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar analyst. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;These clients in particular have a immense value.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In Middle East, oil producing countries have many of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> They not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise of fuel prices, usually harmful to airlines because it is their most important costs-would not if harmful since the country needs money with the rise of oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is an important point because these are less likely than other companies to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil increases, reported Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They coverage of natural risk,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The control of Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing in the market for wide-body aircraft and helping to stop the attempt of encroachment by the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&apos;s victory at the air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus pushes its inception to increase the growth continued at the request of its clients to increase its carrying capacity and autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Actions of the Boeing Company increased by 1.5% to reach the $67.94. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The Mexican president&apos;s sister clearly beaten the Michoacán elections </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the gubernatorial race. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of Governor of the State of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The response of organized crime throughout the voting process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon to radio in an interview on Monday after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, electoral officials... They have seized ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and forced the people to vote for the PRI.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until &quot;to lose the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But it organizes its return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo appears to be demarcated little of Calderon, who was leading in opinion polls before the day of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, the candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently occupies the post of Governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential for this left divided and unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognize the results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the &quot;State, denied any link with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels engaged in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is of the &quot;State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However, violence persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally to the campaign by fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man expected to be the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo in Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The LADS urges Asia to help the euro area </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has applied to India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers in the world&apos;s most rapid growth should &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or of direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> It has discouraged the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe a &quot;indifferent eye&quot; and noted that Asian financial support with the leaders and resources of Europe would &quot;avoid a collapse of the global economy long-term. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected until&quot; at some point but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of Italian debt is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has spurred the fear that the world economy is not in recession, and has been the call of the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag has it appeared it might turn out that the IMF would provide any assistance Asian, but also stated that such bilateral assistance, such as buying bonds of US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, provided greater power in negotiations with Asian partners of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that &quot;India will do everything it can&quot; to help the euro area since its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of arrivals of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the euro area remains unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have enormous challenges ahead and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find the work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich European when they face their own economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept assistance to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to maintain many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause &quot;significant impact&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Forecasts of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5 percent in 2011/12 Asia now face &quot;risk of loss&quot; because of the European threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed &quot;develop&quot; contingency plans &quot;to protect itself from an economic downturn and significant capital flight. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Sévères Pentagon warnings on the potential reduction of defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It has triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through crowds of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now feared that an additional amount of $600 or more of cuts is imminent if the Congress fails to reach agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would be 23% of reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A reduction also important, applied and indiscriminate, would make most of our vessels and of our construction projects unenforceable, you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel, and serious damage to other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians to leave without pay in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Continued The reductions would ultimately affect the fighting troops, Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the funding in time of war contingency accounts abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the disruptions in the core budgets,&quot; warned Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that support the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as undisputed world leader of the military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a result with which we can live, and this is certainly not that we should impose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> What Panetta&apos;s letter and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a compromise budget or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly virulent on possible cuts, even if it is reached itself at the highest position of the Pentagon with years of expertise budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense has painted a grim picture of what could happen, a military with a shell, but no core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without marine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a squad without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is a fighter, without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs, which do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, &quot;Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, it invites to the aggression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how further reductions could &quot;generate significant operational risks: reaction time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed future in combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta stated that some of the largest defense projects could the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new-generation ballistic missile submarine, the new warship coastline and the new ground, which would replace the Humvee vehicle of the army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step to improvement and to respond to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How identify a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at recent headlines indicate to what extent the deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican candidate to the presidency Herman Cain is engaged in exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The Penn State administrators were accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports of a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying the US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie has destroyed careers and convulse of countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The member of Congress from New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, is past for a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted by evidence irrefutable. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate to the John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign financing related to coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And, none of that has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term on ​​son sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The stories of cheating in tests of the school and university are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where the teachers gave the test answers to students to be clear on their performance evaluations. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How many deception have we? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On a given day, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of these are lies piles. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being similar to, say, a board game of charades, where the objective is to describe himself: &quot;I had you,&quot; the detection of serious deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted an extensive search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that older myths on the lies were demystifies. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars look at you in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They do begayent, feeling or is not always in. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, training of the question and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years to consider scientific results in the wide body and still emerge from the knowledge on deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and use to navigate our complex world, especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars are entitled to read the other, making them comfortable, in managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the outgoing lie more than introverts, that men say more lies &quot;focused on them&quot; while women say more than lies &quot;focused on the other,&quot; usually to protect the feelings of someone, that married people lie less frequently to their partners and unmarried persons (but the lies they tell tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a mecreant, the other will feel less guilty when you lie. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> Firstly, observe the normal behavior of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is the so-called &quot;establish the benchmarks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps to provide a baseline for measuring future changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the position of your subject, laughter, the voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know if someone wags normally its feet at all times to not make unjust accusations when you see stir up the feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> May look for signs of misleading verbal and non-verbal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices such as red flags, not evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People misleading can stop the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can target their feet toward the door, look to an exit, significantly change of posture or submit a relief of &quot;post-interview&quot; - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult issues are past. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is done just to seek to initiate the post-interview reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Therefore, beware the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson has derailed by using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search for the find. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Misleading Individuals can also use a language left behind: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Ms. Lewinsky&quot; fully or repeating a difficult issue. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone may use many &quot;langue de bois&quot; in its answer to a difficult question: &quot;Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scam artists to operate their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval of United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration had threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, provoking the anger of unions while appeasing environmentalists, the company seeking to build the pipeline said she is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to a federal license for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of sand dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;It is a real way forward,&quot; said Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year&apos;s elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and it expressed its support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 2.735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do this, it should be cross six States. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have focused on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan are pressure that legislation to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact study in the Department of State found that the project would be only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department&apos;s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a child to vomit for fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York claims that the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a rampage in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, has terrified the girl to the point where she vomited of fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of the singer &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; has scared the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, to the point that it has been &quot;changes in personality, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;the increased fear of foreigners,&quot; said his family during the trial of the Manhattan Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year while the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève preparing to travel as a family. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk would pick up the car, Roseanna Monk down in the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their baggage, Geneviève in his arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that it had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a time. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone came behind me and said: &apos;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&quot; I said &apos;yes&apos; and I went to pick her up, &quot;she says. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle angrily chastised the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> She told me of an aggressive tone: &quot;You should not let your daughter near the door,&quot; said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I replied:&quot; I am not interested in what you say or think.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It became rabid and began to use of language, the word &quot;and&quot; with a strong voice. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> It had a bottle of water and began spraying me of the bottle of water. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> It stated that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to the woman:&quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &quot;said the mother of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle jumped on the mother, who was always Geneviève in his arms, and had to be taken by her friends, who brought him to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Counsel and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family&apos;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money received to a cancer charity for children. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The goal is to take Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct,&quot; said Mr. Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, particularly to a kindergarten teacher with a child aged 18 months.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> The adversity climate has slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management Mario Lopez Valdez, to Sinaloa unemployment and the informality increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year which would be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, auto-appele of change, which has generated great expectations in regard to the advances of the economy, but given adversity climate at the beginning of the year, the increase is not, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Low temperatures from February, from causing loss of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the state&apos;s economy to growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the frozen allotments by the report issued by the Mexican Council Rural Development Soutenable, there has been some damage of 582 million 835 hectares, with a total 78.03 percent have suffered damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chick peas. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The drop in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the State during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because during the January to March 55,000,053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of Active Population Economics, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to increase until 6.19 percent, a rate that is more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18,000,969 people. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly in terms of the actions carried out by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What is an increase in unemployment is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to combat money laundering, because the people who earn US$ the in an illicit manner, it is not easy work to earn them, they invest and use them in something,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration held </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people are here and are sources of work, with the result that unemployment increase,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Lack of serious </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of labor market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the employed population in this state is working without pay as workers in any social insurance institution. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Apart from unemployment and the lack of serious lag, another reason for the state are the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecasting. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly income of workers sinaloens was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Apart from the drop in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 has been the largest reduction of Overseas Direct Investment of the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI in the State has reached 630 thousand $697, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to 143 thousand 312 5 million registered in the same period of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State recorded a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos recorded per year, mainly by the tertiary sector companies. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the requested State in July to Congress public approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim of reactivating the economy, congressional approval of the State was to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November we found no benefit of the debt in any sector of the economy of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>

<seg id="1906"> The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even if the construction programs have progressed so far, they are in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State is not acquitted of its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programs. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the State must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe provided resources for the books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization. </seg>

<seg id="1909"> He noted that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid their contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover the $7 million that the administration of the State had not provided at this session. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;We had this in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, to have access to these programs, we duu obtain the resources to cover that the State had not paid,&quot; he detailla. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> The Court valid &quot;analog cut-off&quot; in Mexico by 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The replacement of analog by digital signales exchange is one of the most important that the world has suffered the last years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies made against the presidential decree which advance the so-called analog cut-off from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its authority when it issued the decree outlining the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this outcome, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionalite Decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft award, developed by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the decree as non-constitutionnel, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In for the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and assuming the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the Order and all actions planned by it for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary meeting of Ministers resolved also dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In its intervention, the Minister President said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Government cannot structure through general measures for standards that public administration is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I do not believe that if he did it would affect the independence of the regulatory body,&quot; and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Government, which has a constitutional mandate the leadership of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The replacement of analog by digital signales signales is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years and this is reflected in better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of signal and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Ajourner the change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a public policy decision that not only has a technical dimension, &quot;since it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These issues, he said, &quot;require the operation of a system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the ability of the Executive of the State.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> It recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the digital transition and they did it through the Commission, despite the fact that they had the very specialized technical bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it provides in the administrative sphere compliance with laws issued by the Législative, he assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> It analyses the possibility of a statement &quot;vote by vote&quot; in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According the data highlighted by PERs, the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is to only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where the data identified by the Program Results Électoraux Preliminary Notices (PERs) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is to only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past November 9, the electoral body approved a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal reform in electoral matters. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> It is recalled that Michoacán has not approved or its Political Constitution and the Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Act of Justice, in conjunction with the Congress of State approved the reforms shortly before that end the legal time limit for election that this trial can enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication within the deadlines specified by the Act of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that it had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Authority Législative and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the representative of the state for the constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to &quot;sanction or challenge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed on the possibility of &quot;vote by vote,&quot; María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that through the approval of the guidelines by the General Council of EMP it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counts of votes by the local electoral body. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Thus, the partial count of electoral votes, of one or more packages, it may be that the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the ballot box is not in the president of that company; or there are errors or obvious alterations of minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Moreover, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the presumed winner of the election and the candidate who won the second place in the election is equal or by less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party or coalition that has presented the second of candidates reported. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total count of the vote may also be achieved if at the end the common statement it is assumed that the difference between the candidate and the second place winner is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is a petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packets that were subject of the partial count. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PERs, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 minutes total. </seg>

<seg id="2049"> We have offered a two enormous shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> We are very eager to produce it. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we like to do of surfing and the jungle; for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to make the surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends would always to make the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, alongside of Mexico, are great places to make the surfing; that is how we have learned, through the gents who like surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never products there, we have no restriction with regard to what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good repertoire and various. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the directory. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What is it? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 different songs and each love songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the inventory that we no longer have interpreted for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked the songs and we have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> This fact that the show is more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, you are celebrating 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In looking back, it is difficult to believe everything you have been successful? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Firstly, I believe that none of us imagined that we would train a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it seems like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together we émotionne much. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to parts of the world which we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could only get better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What means for you is to have been a key element in the creation of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This has always been an honor to be part of this group of major groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement emerged from a group of friends and is uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a group emerged from a city, but it is much more odd when five or ten groups emerge at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We still play with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be still friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this son of Seattle that has emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a group as your remains united and with the same members for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for the other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and through is there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each test. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We have confidence in each other with music of each and it could only get better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; however, through your success, you have to do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We assure the fact that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of large multitudes and people who love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If not to forget that the people are there for the music, we help not to forget the need to respect the music and what made, without getting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really to any of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember of your project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we wrote of good songs and early it was great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before of the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which began in the group with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laughing, talking about football, music and many other things with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an amazing human being and we lack. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and why you have chosen for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, production has sent videos with different proposals and that was the group that we liked the most, so we are keen to see what Las Robertas can offer online and it must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> What change you always the words of Yello Ledbetter online? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It&apos;s who sang and I believe that it is with the first words that he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, what are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first which I remember there are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How succeeded Pearl Jam has maintain under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if it is in now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Early, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What should this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs from the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even though they may sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think if you grandis and there is trauma in your life and you lose to a friend or relative, these things are starting to influence your art and your music and these songs, without doubt, is that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I believe also that we can also be pleased and even as it can be to obscure music. </seg>

<seg id="2123"> Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties </seg>
<seg id="2124"> A formal procession, with the head Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and patterns, will on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive to the exchange of information in the political affairs between the two nations,&quot; according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> According to the local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the countries that the international community continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to the European country. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Mexico since November chairs the G20, a group of emerging economies and developed stronger in the world, and had in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to send the realization of agreements to exchange tax out of the &quot;gri list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Treaty Free Trade (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The plumber moustachu passes to three dimensions with &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Super Mario, tireless, fought for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but had never done so in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; will contend for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Title, arriving this month to stores across the world, was designed from the outset to fully exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, enabling it to play in three dimensions without the use of glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &quot;Mario is the man who must say as must operate the stereo without glasses,&quot; said the head of press for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Álvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first video game for Nintendo originally designed for this format,&quot; because so far the success as &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; was of adaptations of existing titles. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is a video game &quot;accessible&quot; that allows some rapid and fluid. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Álvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to hang the less skilled users. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Once overcome, most experts will be a &quot;second round&quot; to levels of game, which this time are more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> In addition, users can choose to real time between an aggressive &quot;D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2141"> This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the person to a portable console, which is no longer required since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> In these video games Nintendo made a nod to the followers of the saga and repeat the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumber moustachu must travel undermined platforms of perils for release to the Princess Peach. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Although I find developments in the player movements, the environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi &quot;possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Colom gives its consent to Portillo&apos;s extradition to the United States </seg>
<seg id="2145"> President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given an order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to meet the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$ 70 million. </seg>

<seg id="2148"> He stated that during his mandate &quot;he had not helped&quot; in any judicial resolution and it had been to all extraditions that he had. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> What Colom made requires Executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the interval 2004-04. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and of the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala and having secured its human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the case prior to extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case. </seg>

<seg id="2159"> The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of responsible entities and institutions which in these 25 years worked with the association. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The varied political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Alongside the President of Regional Government Catalonia (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and the current mayor and former Deputy Mayor Councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma. </seg>

<seg id="2165"> &quot;The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work that it is doing,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Ownership invaded by squatters for micro-fetes, evacuated </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The invaders were appropriate in 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, to Balmes, 51 </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the No. 51 of Street Balmes had ended. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people have left at noon yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and they hold micro-fetes which desesperaient the neighbors, by court order and without need of a police intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> At the end of the operation were changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From this day there will be access control,&quot; affirmat the administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters, who invaded 11 of 13 apartments of the building-the rest were inhabited, won the electrical installation and a portion of the water, from painting the walls and leaving any residue of any kind, especially of boxes of alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> The first three apartments were the scene of celebrations of masses, which lasted until two days and desesperaient tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> His owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as the occupation of the building his case dropped a 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque referred to the invaders of the property was unfair of the jurisdiction, since they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the club they were worth 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Moreover, the owner of the local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbors for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially the participants organized celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense the last few weeks, as the angry neighbors of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The responsible for the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that it has reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it is nine months that he &quot;forgave&quot; him rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> La Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The President of municipal group CP of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had sought the last week &quot;the immediate evacuation of the building to deal with the problems of living together and citizenship that it caused to residents and degradation of the area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The popular leader explained that before the summer only a floor of the building was occupied, but the last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there are also flights. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> It is in this sense that he added that &quot;we must put an end to impunity and be relentless against anti-social behavior generated in the property.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Also yesterday, the Mossos Catalan (local police) evacuated a building to Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to ¶ 35 of Street Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four were arrested immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy on the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> By the mid 1980s, in the height of the deja-eteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Administration has printed signs of promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become new, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that is not on the north-south axis, or high (mountain), low (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola as a natural environment park is to the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed by 16 competition for all gateways to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door shall provide to the idea of park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> That is, or someone wants to put the doors in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question appears alone: Collserola: Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both with regard to its organization as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme which two members of this ancient caste elected to speak when they recognize in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> This is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot; because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the blocks of green was not conducted to end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It must start from the basis that the park more extended Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;gave the verdict the architect for which the&quot; doors of Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap &quot;lexicon: we must think to them&quot; such as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas in which action is needed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;few perils.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> New perils that are derived from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of the public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum &quot;its swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the own boundaries on which we can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something means establishing already the next step,&quot; i.e., the excess. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;Consider to urban planning, new instruments, because current (in reference to Plan General Métropolitain (MGP) can cause of authentic disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Keeping more to the issue, Modol felt that, by streamlining, the watershed of the El Valles region of Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, not.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol said that there was already a work done by the Collserola Patronat which &quot;must not be lost,&quot; in appreciation for the opportunity that the city offers corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Furthermore, it means that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; whether the technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success,&quot; he says) that the creation: &quot;We, the architects, should be only a tool.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that is the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;We called 16 cross-cutting competition, he says, in the sense montagne-mer, but there is not a longitudinal reading that way and understand the area as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This is, at least in this case, it has opted to participate in the 16 competition. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In a different way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and with the definition of the architect of the door. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately than Ronda of Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an equipment that makes a gentle transition zone between the city and the green. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino to forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days for provisional arrest, the legal proxy of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the proceedings initiated against him for alleged blackmail </seg>
<seg id="2222"> After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the basis of the legal authority of the Casino Red grant the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red Gil, Sergio García, published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manual Jonás it required the payment of a quotte economic for the mayor of Monterrey will allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office opened a criminal case against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in detention for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours before the Department Public Agent 3 of Patrimoniaux offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the former Headquarters of the State capital. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> There remained for the 49 days when it delivered a second order of detention after the officer of the Public Ministry has dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19 October he was transferred to penal center of Cadereyta allegedly for having sing with one and a half million pesos the owners of Casino Red, but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On 25 October harvest an order was issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation confirmed there was evidence sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás, like on the collection of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gambling house in exchange to allow its operation. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the basis of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore it could recover its freedom in the next hours. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the legal formalities, the officer of the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the injury had been recovered and that members of the gambling house was that granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried to withhold the name. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Under the record 197/2011 the legal pardon has been granted to Jonás Larrazábal and later we will not make any claim on the trial against him; we asked no compensation for damage and no punishment. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the hearing of based the statutory authority of the gambling house, at 3:50 p.m. we ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of municipe of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonás legally and that he had been forgiven his file would be classified. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> He will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge issued. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome shall communicate details of the plane crash in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and another seven people </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the conditions of climate were adequate to fly. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The elements that suggest that the unit had several contacts with soil, the blades had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> It also informed of the fact that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, he said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not report the emergence of parts on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a search has been reported that there is no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact is presented in a structural manner. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and meet the requirements for the transport. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground had a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the time being, the Secretary provided that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last several months, it may even take a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director of Airports and Auxiliary Services provided that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the State Presidential Maggiore operated in speed of cruiser and happened on a soft ground upward. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operating cruiser at the time of the impact,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Vol visual: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Normative According to the aircraft, the flight was conducted according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Reports in IMMA mentioned adequate conditions take-off, and as and as the aircraft has progressed towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of clouds at low heights. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Routes selected: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that &quot;due to conditions of clouds the crew has sought a zone of low height and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Contact information of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the there was no impact or loss of control or alteration of the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of remnants of the aircraft in a small area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a right track and lateral. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The dispersion model of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was hit the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> It has not detected traces of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The final results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the soil. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work of parts of the aircraft was found at a height of 9,000,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground had a slope which extends from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which it is possibly desarticule throughout its journey. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information provides elements that suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the soil. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful research in an area further that circled the area around the accident, has not been found disperses parts of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by specialists of the NPI </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he led an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called protocol&apos;Génétique of obesity of children and adolescents&apos; that will have the markers associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a press release, the head of the Technical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social support. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by experts and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Investigation and Centre for Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> At the investigation should be invited to participate the population with and without right, run for participating sports units of IMSS to Valle de México, where are the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> It stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity is conducted in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de Oriente). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After reaching the goal of having 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and the e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify among Mexican children and young people of risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As we celebrate the Day on November 14 World Diabetes, he mentioned that the CIHR&apos;s aim is to collect three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires relating to food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family history of inherited diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He detailed that Saturdays will be used for all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (trying to identify people associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López reported that this investigation is the product of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;Health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there has been an increase, in the case of boys, the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; as regards the overweight are also observed an increase dramatique&apos;, pointed out the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He indicated that the rationale for the search for markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from the other by his genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He informed that on average, the Mexican had a 65 percent of heredity indo-americaine European, a 30 percent and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability burning the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Ila even said that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of developing metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors call by writing to parents, which are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must undertake to prevent the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic conditions: the sedentarism, which is the lack of physical activity daily, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going off on short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another issue is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, meat pie to corn flour wrapped in leaves of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The asphalt of UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signales that the streets were resolved, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which provided that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous deck is adequate, blackcurrants may be reduced or even eliminated entirely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During its conference A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera asphalt felt that this type of change could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance, and therefore, the training of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that asphalt, the heavier share oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, the molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes, and with a low molecular weight molecules, called malthenes, which together give the paved its characteristic viscoelastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C viscosity is great and to 50 degrees C, presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and shifts during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, including the last three involve asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones swam in asphalt compacted and later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each small stones that form the layer, signalat says, is bounded year asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When vehicles spend in generating efforts, it provides that the forces spread very well in the streets. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If had of modified asphalt, they propagate better, opinat play the chemical. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the layer of asphalt, he says, is a final layer called wearing, made in gemstone, i.e., sand which is also steeped in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more than mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As the part of the set that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they significantly affect the performance of the layer of asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the soil is wet, the water runs inside the layer is difficult that it ensure, which softened all layers of pavement and therefore cause of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the trial of formation of a blackcurrant, he said, the first to be striker is the film rolling and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury did not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement should always be related to the care of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and can repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What has failed the candidate to Valle to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna is not the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives its title number 14 of Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had simply with the fact of being on the podium of winning money, wear the crown and the band that certifies as new Princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women of Valle del Cauca, who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000) - Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today the big question that many world is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What is it has failed? Because the result represents the defeat of a large favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen Police and Best Face Jolie to Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first key factor considered in the decision by the jury of the designate First Princess is the fact that it was not satisfied with her answer to the question &quot;? What was the book that has marked and why? posed by Martín Gómez, Murillo of the Carreta Literaria Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of final culturaliser, I think the book that marked my childhood is&quot; Little Prince &quot;, a book is deep enough. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot; is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called &quot;The fervor of the blood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response did not please firstly due to &quot;be culturaliser&quot; and secondly for not specifically explain how each book cited the had marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But Melina said at the end of the ceremony that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome &quot;the universe and wise, it is what must happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for everyone, please read a little, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is a great book&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Between the assumptions launched is that Valle was destroyed by patronage. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist in Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the highly acclaimed and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best costume craft, and Queen Mother), &quot;that woke the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not conspicuous on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It is noted that in his first presentation in bathing suit at the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although both parades it seemed sure of itself, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy of representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist for the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; (As at home), Canal NCR stated that the fact that Melina was designated Princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price for the competition is not the crown of Queen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Moreover, Valle has avoided the press to the end, and it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on its interest in the social initiatives, that is the essence of the National Beauty Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed in relation to the social needs of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It also speculates that Valle has sinned by its defects behind and the fibrosis that was in her abdomen, but this is contradictory precisely because the board elected as the candidate&apos;Beauté Natural healthier with the body, good food and physical work responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina had not the best body, that it was best, &quot;but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well-known, it left marks the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgery she had undergone. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgery are good, but Valle failed to make them. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Her body was never his strength and she lost because of this aspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this price, that the National Beauty Competition provides for the first time, after the parade in swimwear has is a cruel prediction that took place yesterday evening, we said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as sovereign, or as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competitions by designation of National Competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will be in history as one of the queens that despite its dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not received the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the person of Cali which identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste of Cali rose to history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC of Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme commander of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano,&quot; considering its fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> The seven dactyloscopistes ITC working in the field, this week it was the turn of &apos;call&apos; Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> Early in his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses that were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and after following appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take clothes with him for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something of very large the expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew he had to identify two bodies and it was suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guerrilla world&apos;s oldest, therefore asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don&apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a sampling and a lantern, Eliazar has compared the corpse&apos;s fingerprints with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye misled him not: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme commander of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In research of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Sijín dactyloscopiste of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano,&quot; is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many of people is not our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The fingerprinting is an exact science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In addition to identify bodies, the dactyloscopistes support the investigations for crimes such as theft and manslaughter and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When captured, many offenders are of false identity cards or have no documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take their fingerprints and seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told that flight in a case it had to remove part of a wall of a house, because in this area the thief had supported his hand to break a safe full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not of adequate areas to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who participated to different flights,&quot; he remembers. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The fingerprints can also exclude or confirm the suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently a man was found dead, with bottles of beverage around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> For interlude of the investigation it was determined that a parent can be suspect of crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if No. guarantees it the murderer, that the place on the crime scene. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste ITC explained that &quot;the fingerprints is extracted from objects with physical or chemical reagents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> Where they occur, using a sampling or a band for the levy. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declinquents, or the National Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombian,&quot; indicated the ITC expert. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that it is not how it is shown in the television program CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As all that glitters is not gold, all that it comes is not necessarily a footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> It may, however, be used, if you realize the confrontation necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Outraged&quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators overwhelmed before the place Zuccotti for camping. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Much of people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The integral of movement occupies Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York while trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators overwhelmed before the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to access through a judicial order that allows&apos;indignés&apos; camp again in this area, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there has been new judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; dit-un spokespersons of the movement &quot;occupies Wall Street,&quot; Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray explained that the response of&apos;indignés&apos; evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibits the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Moreover, the&apos;indignés&apos; have occupied a new central park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, property of the Parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least during a time they have managed to occupy the place, but after the Police is moved and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray was unable to confirm the fact that concrete figures, ensuring Efe he saw some journalists which was also from handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there are old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene for them before the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti, which is a forum for private property, remains closed pending the conclusion of a court hearing under this Tuesday during which must review the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some demonstrators displaced so far were at that time and distributed copies of the judiciary and they were even to agents who monitored the place, which has caused&apos;certains small affrontements&apos;, &quot;said Bray, who denounced the fact that some official hit the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The law prohibits authorities to evacuate members of occupies Wall Street or to apply&apos;lois published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators for new access to park with tents or other properties that they heard of used ago&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this law, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, which it was alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which has arrested 200 people and which was committed to the fact that the demonstrators&apos;violaient the law &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was &quot;a place in which people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people,&quot; because &quot;some outlets had received threats&quot; and the residents were afraid &quot;to their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and Bloomberg shows that the committee is more concerned to defend the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; said the movement&apos;s spokesman, who accused the mayor of &quot;not respect freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2398"> At side of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, it will be in the television program &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; the next December 1 </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen of &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; aid in &quot;Baywatch,&quot; rabbit in &quot;Playboy,&quot; wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special program on Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private channel CTV Television announced today that Anderson, alongside the &quot;crooner&quot; (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will be in the television program &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; the next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV has distributed today images of television program in which Anderson, also known for the private wide dissemination on the Internet of a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, the drummer of &quot;Mötley Crüe,&quot; Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in supporting in a nursery a doll representing to Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a famous comedian Canadian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; of Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Apart from Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel of CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March was married to Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is itself not far from controversy. </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan Returns after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP increase a 1.5% through domestic consumption and put an end to the spiral of decline in the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the month of March, the Japanese economy was still paralysed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake which became Japanese nuclear crisis, the country&apos;s worst disaster since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The Government of Tokyo&apos;s first estimates have calculated the material losses to 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global environment, seems to be mitigated. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the GDP data between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: GDP increased a 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6 percent annual rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The recorded the second quarter, for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012, requires, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period of January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of acquisition of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Indeed, businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increases non-interrompue. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy not based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus that invite everyone to take advantage of the crisis to build, or rebuild, the infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan woke up mainly through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents the Japanese 60% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable increased 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo recovered the internal market when the Japanese yen -- the currency -- has become a &quot;refuge&quot; elected by the investors fleeing the values in eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecasts of United States, a privilege that is like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country with a floating line is determined by the economic health of major technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September the contribution of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decline custody. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;Follow the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicated that the majority of member countries have submitted in September of clearer signals of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are limited. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Because it fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Eurozone has even been under of the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight digits to 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens feeds of new the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign no written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With risk premiums peripheral triggered uncertainty and resettled in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The sensation that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek Government of transition is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than a real belief of political forces is to be confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in its designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the scheduled dates, that of 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of the Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; said Papadimos yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate that will tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras No. identifies the doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leader went one step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, the organizations to release the 8,000 million that Athens needs urgently, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of commitment of adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, still upset by the impact caused by the referendum of va-tout Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that the requirement is firm: it does provide assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign a &quot;written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors back &quot;very quickly&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;the necessary elements to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, even if there is a definitive date either. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek still have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The Queen Sofía: &quot;These are instruments for the progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen stresses the place &quot;predominant&quot; of Spain with regard to the type of financial </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has achieved a prominent place at the global level in the role of Micro-finances.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the past two decades the second donor in the world in relation to this instrument of cooperation which &quot;gasoline&quot; lies in the fact that it is a &quot;tool for the social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in humans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Summit of Microcredit to Valladolid with certainty that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &quot;very special, in that a goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below a dollar per day, which is set the&quot; poverty line &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues to work to expand the network of&quot; beneficiaries &quot;in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot; responsibility, &quot;said the Queen Sofía, which had hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday,&quot; guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women &quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have &quot;achieved many objectives&quot; and &quot;we are facing a lot of challenges.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The of Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it must promote &quot;two basic purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, Her Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families which have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they now live. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The impetus in the development of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;followed the trail initiated a few years ago to pioneer a way&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as &quot;an act of justice and due recognition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she described the father of this instrument as an &quot;idealistic admirable in the global cause of poverty reduction,&quot; the work which it is since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground its lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d&apos;Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I have seen a continuing evolution,&quot; said Her Majesty, including the relationship with this project provided yesterday the adjective &quot;head of family&quot; meeting at Valladolid by the &quot;banquer of the poor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, Queen Sofía has finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Imperative ethics&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that &quot;solidarity is an ethics imperative&quot; for any democratic State. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this regard, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is &quot;a permanent obligation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that the microcredit involves &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the Governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not leave that it is the victim of cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation for development.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; to provide &quot;confidence&quot; to persons &quot;excluded for all close the door&quot;; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city that &quot;contaminated opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2458"> European The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the convention of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, was held without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally in the program but has imposed in the fall, including to meet the activists who consider government policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow of Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation lasting several minutes that were right, on the basis of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, very Europhile Wolfgang Schäuble, the Finance Minister, left no room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The core of the Chancellor, and of the motion -- is in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time is ripe for a breakthrough in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage &quot;to give a face to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress which the inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Course, it is unlikely that the 27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone is asked. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, delegates rejected the proposal by an overwhelming majority to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank in terms of the weight of each economy, which obviously was to strengthen Germany&apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> To defuse the climate inside of his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but has not sought to win its conference on the back of &quot;smaller&quot; European countries or the countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> In recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Indeed, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What is the fraud to judgments disease? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the sickness absence. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a body of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurring theme, since 2007, of the fight against fraud and social assistance. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sickness absence. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First in an aim of budgetary savings: the government intends to impose on private employees of a fourth day of waiting before the takeover of a stoppage of work. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In clear, specific business without agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days&apos; pay, therefore at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that risk to generate anger, but that would be EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And who would be accompanied by another measure, of scope more symbolic: impose to officials a day of uncompensated deficiency in event of a work stoppage (they have so far not waiting period, against three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunch the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuse work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you reimburse,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is in fact the subject since 2002 of a constant monitoring and offensive policies, who most often borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> We first on the national figures a moment. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than EUR 237 million daily allowances were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, the per diem in 2008 accounted for 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and occupational accidents, sickness and 54 percent related to, or EUR 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> So 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have experienced an average of 14.5 days&apos; absence from work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, said that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were disease for a period of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbors, the French workers are no more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for reasons of health or not) was, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud to judgments disease represents very little deal with black labor. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> With regard to fraud, it is only a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Strengthening of legislation since 2002 is that systematic controls are on the judgments of disease more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, on 1.5 million, controls the CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 made for short-term judgments were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; or 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases &quot;inappropriate or unjustified&quot; on 1.2 million, is 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total, therefore 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified,&quot; for millions of employees having a sick. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents little face, for example, to the undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> The MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros in lost tax revenue per year, more than the total cost of per diems, and therefore much more that fraud in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> It is what said Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be able to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of fiscal adjustment,&quot; said the head of the government, who pronounced his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, as the country&apos;s participation in the euro area &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly, Mr. Papadémos has projected that the country&apos;s public deficit will be reduced to &quot;around nine percent&quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after having been of 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right denied the new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed Monday his support to the measures already approved to try to find a way out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not on an additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We shall not be voting in favor of new measures,&quot; he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> It has agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and to combat the waste but hostile to any policy that would hinder the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> A Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and EU debloqueraient not necessary the loan of EUR 8 billion without written assurances from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that its floor was sufficient and that it would be nothing under external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It must legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live in denial of the death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> Canadian society lives in the denial of the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians are indeed to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to this effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It is one of the findings of an extensive report of the Royal Society of Canada, attended by six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the choice is required, with a patient found competent to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> From the outset, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of the death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to address the topic of death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Médicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we hear the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the country, it is in Quebec that the rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said would not change the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Or, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries in which these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization lead to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consenting. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Instead, said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, would be many more cases of these excesses specifically in the country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; says Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians in favor of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people in end of life to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia would not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled persons is of less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> For those who performed the assisted suicide, 41% surveyed feel that they should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In peacekeeping or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> As, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals are trained to abide by a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in the area of palliative sedation or terminal, already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and it is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reservations other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts&apos; report of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of the signatories of the experts report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask to have it assistance to commit suicide,&quot; said Mr. Deschamps, who visited yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values involved in the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Or, in society, &quot;he said, there are signs and constraints.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the findings of the report, which it referred to as &quot;power clear pro-euthanasia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contested in particular the data of the report regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, is in the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan called on President Assad to leave power </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Damascus denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Syria is becoming increasingly isolated </seg>

<seg id="2560"> &quot;If Bashar had his country&apos;s best interest at heart, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said King of Jordan, a neighbor of Syria, in an interview with the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> &quot;Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot meet the will,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring countries in respect of which Turkey adopted an increasingly hard line. </seg>

<seg id="2576"> The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has claimed a little time for markets to form his team and implement a program, containing &quot;sacrifices&quot; in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before today to meet with the unions and the employers. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> It should put in place a relatively small firm composed of technocrats outside Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> &quot;Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, MP for one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part said expect Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in parliament to ensure that the new government has a sufficient support. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The consultations will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti a short list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Mr. Monti said nervousness of stock markets and bond yesterday, asking the time. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In &quot;democracy, there are specific time&quot; to prepare a government and its program, he said, is &quot;confident that the markets will be patient and understanding.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2584"> His designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Designated Prime Minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include &quot;policies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The new government must last until 2013, when the next parliamentary elections, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Mr Monti is committed, once entered into service, to work in an emergency and in the goal that Italy &quot;protagonist&quot; in Europe again. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy doesn&apos;t change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget balance by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, requested in particular new austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who discussed Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, &quot;as a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Mr. Monti, known for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a &quot;change of time&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;berlusconisme,&quot; the &quot;teacher&quot; symbolizing &quot;the serious challenge&quot; and &quot;another Italy,&quot; according to the editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> The great unknown will be the longevity of his team. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> President Napolitano would avoid early elections, as Italy must place by April 2012 to EUR 200 billion of government bonds. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear detonator usable with a weapon, said Monday a US NGOs specialized in the nuclear risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Nuclear Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> IAEA expressed the last week of its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of Iran&apos;s nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The ISIS drawing widely in documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to establish a company producing &quot;nano-diamants&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic difficulties of its society have led to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It then cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its last report, the IAEA cited &quot;strong evidence that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system&quot; &quot;has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only familiar with this technique, but, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Anti-Muslim Crimes and offences increased by 50% </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Crimes and offences against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or little progress, according to the FBI statistics released Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 percent, against an increase of 13 percent of violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 percent of crimes and offences anti-religieux. </seg>

<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again,&quot; said the human rights organization Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,&quot; the organization said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights,&quot; said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US government can and must do more to address these abuses,&quot; he said, estimating that it could go through an improvement of police reports on the &quot;hate crimes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The &quot;hate crime&quot; in the federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color of skin, religion, the origin and now gender. </seg>

<seg id="2616"> This enables them to learn whether they are forwarding messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have any favorite messages, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> This new formula of Twitter was tested on &quot;a small percentage of users in August&quot; before being distributed to the entire network Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner. </seg>

<seg id="2619"> On the network, users were sliced through &quot;tweets&quot; on the interest of this innovation. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Inclusion of a fiscal &quot;golden rule&quot; in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The/Christian Social Democratic government of grand coalition in power in Austria Tuesday decided to include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce the budget deficit and avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had even announced this decision on the basis of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is of 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest in more each year,&quot; argued the Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria and responds to a request from the member countries of the euro zone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by the end of 2012 to the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in legislation of equal value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The system adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the &quot;German model,&quot; Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year of 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, beginning in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities to submit budgets to the balance. </seg>

<seg id="2633"> Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen would continue to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We speak as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility&quot; in the yen&apos;s exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Tuesday, the yen was not far from historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> This day, Tokyo has sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record of force since 1945 against the greenback. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen is regularly since recovered, boosted by the acquisition of investors as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar is passed Tuesday in the 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This surge of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it said the cost of products made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when converted into national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan fight to rebuild&quot; since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Mr Noda said that fears that the rise of the yen does not kill the fragile recovery in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third global economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the quarter precedent- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption sealed by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But Prime Minister found that the high cost of yen did not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has for its part called the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures,&quot; suggesting that no further monetary easing was to wait Wednesday. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy Policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts should prevail on the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is one issue that cannot be addressed based on considerations of short term or the subject of the &quot;emotion, it is energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and the cost of the electricity directly affect the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous is the opportunity to think about these issues and to the place that is the nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinion on objective facts, sound data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet &quot;, the&quot; demographic changes will result in a doubling of demand &quot;electricity by 2050, unless to deprive a huge part of the global population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it must address the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce the &quot;power continuously, without forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case of Belgium, which makes his to the need to find a source of replacement able to substitute, or of Switzerland, just not to build the latest generation of nuclear power plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name only a few, continue their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, meanwhile, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their Central Park with the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will result in the rise of the price of the &quot;electricity, exacerbated by the increased energy dependency on imported gas, in particular Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of coal and gas-fired plants. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, all of these adverse effects are already being felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to ponder. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe of the wind &quot;, which takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind, under which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a bill (&quot;power 40% higher than that of French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy the cost of the &quot;energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the&quot; the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would create a strong increase in the price of the &quot;illusory electricity, which would make the declarations on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a large majority of French are unwilling to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, the surveys show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Recall that the energy policy of our country has helped to build an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs created. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative source of jobs that cannot be relocated. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France were to decide to leave the nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs in reducing as shrinking the EUR 6 billion annual export French d &quot;nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electrician commission a PRT designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> For resolve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there is no source of production of &quot;miracle power, any more than there is of evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva of low CO2 emitting solutions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementarity of d &quot;energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For the nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> We in France a Safety Authority which control strict and transparent on existing plants and in the construction of Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl, the reactor design and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done for the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Fruit of this approach and of a cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the PRT is a design making it able to withstand such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While it is considered by all electricians wanted to build a powerhouse, the cessation of its construction in Flamanville is a magnificent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF in leaving the way open to capture the key leadership role in the development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the &quot;emotion, the dogmas and the partisan tactics dominate a debate as critical for the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -engorgement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment which are against foreign students that was in the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming the passage that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, masonry and of restaurant servers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is rarely analyzed under the economic angle. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> A right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with almost 2 million migrant workers,&quot; and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot accommodate all the poverty of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For both sides, the immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we daignera grant towards immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its program, François Holland is limited to the trivial, indicating that co-development will solve the migration problem. &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps pay electoral advantage; but it is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the recall economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restricting immigration growth and anemia night to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may have to substitute for national workers, especially the unskilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much complementary rather than substitutes for national employees, acting for most of the trades in shortage areas of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Immigrants low-skilled work in sectors that do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that suffers a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows increases between 0.6 and 0.9% of long-term real wages. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized American among Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in the European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labor Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over the whole of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the beginning of the mandate, fetching missing points of growth &quot;with teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Teeth in question, as to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, remains to think European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a very sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be borne in mind that, to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Salazar, Franco in Spain, in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, for democracy triomphat permanently of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and for the exercise of the most direct way that is. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Are known, since Napoleon &quot;the Petit,&quot; that it was a facility for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as said once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, of the Enlightenment, of solidarity, a social and economic justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis of Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally first and a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The palinodie of vrai-faux Greek referendum has been revealing in this respect of double value: the need for a strong return of policy, but also the sense of disturbing its inability, for its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic battle are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the Republicans no longer have troops in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain from demand a succession of national referendums, organized in an ad hoc and piecemeal. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A licence to European absolute monarch or a jump to feet in the vacuum of the nationalist reaction: the choice for the citizen. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No cut-off, we do not want any but a common exercise, as of right, calm and continuous, the choice and of democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no of crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal-cannot be more where stop l &quot;list, because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is Europe as a whole which pander to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its helplessness and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is Europe as a whole which is humiliated on the international scene. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that loses its sovereignty, gently and with it each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency, is to restore the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it together, that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After long fought this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, the world needs today the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Either. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But the thinking without strong political and democratic integration, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new stage of European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;make&quot; of Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic plan. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be done in building a more democratic Europe politically, a real European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> In order to Europe, making Europeans. </seg>

<seg id="2773"> The World show of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 is expected to complete on an increase of 11 percent of global sales of smart cards (bank card, phone SIM card...), to more than 6 billion, according to the Eurosmart firm. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The segment most enabling contactless is technology that allows to pay the transit or to settle its purchases simply by approaching the a card reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, compared with 320 million a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share should further progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card (6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Long the laggard of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals to accept the. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But mass merchandisers are the very hard. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has thus issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To move to the gear, it is now that the banks are their clients. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two major French institutions are committed to disseminate to the future systematically equipped for the bank cards to their clients without contact,&quot; says Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test the payment by mobile </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Few devices are now equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary to conduct transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They are lagging behind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they should finally have a real growth the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We are building on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world,&quot; says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Agriculture Credit Bank yesterday announced the launch of a test from December to June to Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone about 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And Société Générale, too, said yesterday for the placing on the market of an offer that allows clients to pay without contact with their mobile. </seg>

<seg id="2798"> Soupçonnés long-standing, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Sunday, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers was now &quot;satisfied.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The manner in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,&quot; he said without further detail. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to be a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered bridges. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> They are kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the following day with several of their abductors during an operation by French special forces. </seg>

<seg id="2807"> According Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular concern to the investigators: one leads to a Niger which has been extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who was close to Aqmi and of the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a step forward, but it should probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;It has been known for years that the sect external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,&quot; moderating Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> These months &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its procedures, which include the use of suicide bombers or explosives of increasingly complex and as well as those used by invoice Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated little of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A rapid success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and of the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; in Hausa, advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These are first of all churches, bars, the administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The Abuja reaction is, as usual, without nuances. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested living, is killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> At last Christmas, it claims an attack that left 80 dead in Jos, and another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is in control of the police headquarters in a suicide attack, its first. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters may believe. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other increasing the rhetoric and the shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans, often unsubstantiated, abound. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the best positioned in the race to the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old Party,&quot; has threatened to drag China before the WTO and to cause &quot;for manipulation of their currency,&quot; a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of large parts of its industry to Asia. </seg>

<seg id="2839"> It called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, who sits in the depths of the polls, remains muted. </seg>

<seg id="2851"> The current president&apos;s opponents counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in its wine in terms of counter-terrorism. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, new door of ntree of Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia in from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with flashing. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Over 500 guests including four Heads of State and of Government participated, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Netherlands counterpart Mark Rutte have turned all the steering wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km linking the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube must be completed end 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of the French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And already discussing the possibility of building a third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge project has the air of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> As a result, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it becomes more difficult for them, to Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to take Poland, in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> It is whether the topic is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, through its support to the Russian draft, is earned greater security of its supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between Europeans of the East and West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has succeeded, in just five years, upholding its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strong consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us to organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> This explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, the destination of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The steel tube submarine is gaine of concrete to protect against ships&apos; anchors. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It is based on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m in length. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> For the building, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;A 100 had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It was also necessary to strengthen the measures to protect flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The heavy metal tube is a long snake, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: or valve, or station maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Control A platform was expected off the coast of Sweden, but the project were abandoned while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Crown corporation Russian settle permanently off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Muller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of leakage, the gas content in the pipeline therefore escapes in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by builders who have planned the welds to hear a flight every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a machine that circulates within the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> In the form of a cigar, it is introduced to the tube, wide of a metre in diameter, and is driven by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres second, it provides specific information on any deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without the slightest compensation. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gas flow is simply provided by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bars in the departure, and 100 to the arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51 percent of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> With are joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then leased to the company, for a renewable period of twenty years, all of the gas transport capacity. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas really moved,&quot; said Jens Muller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% of bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas which may, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas with each hour that passes. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>

<seg id="2912"> Created a dozen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine to restore the taste of the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It smacks of adventures, of hours to write in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its rectangular black cover, elastic, leaves an off-white color, as aged by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the Carnet Moleskine as we know today was born in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time of launch of a notebook design but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book is based on an ancient production, the mole skin (skin mole) which means a cotton varnish used to cover of seats by example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of book was highly prized by writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has returned to the fore an object old and forgotten, that was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the mark in Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26% to $12.7 million pieces passed. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to establish a composite drawing of the buyer, as the Notebook won both the businessman that the student and the professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> At the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and grown. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, in nearly 100 today and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in bookstores, of the Fnac to small shops in the downtown core and was able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the air time and this new requirement of writing, despite the rise of e-mail,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This signature cultural with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists present their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it also launched coverage in leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has succeeded in diversifying its products: bags, agenda, pens, covers computer... The mark is on a wide range of materials. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that made the envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund .10 Capital Europe today, Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>

<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, against 9 percent for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Décourageant? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> No, &quot;said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for employment of disabled persons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;Progress since 15 years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;There is still a great deal to be done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for persons with disabilities, remain many barriers to access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the pan and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for persons with disabilities, against 38 percent on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, all criteria that significantly complicate the return to employment, and that &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; said Christian Grapin, Director General of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help firms to hire disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Is for the brakes objectives. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remains the unsaid, changing attitudes, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A survey conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that managers interviewed &quot;a low level of awareness of disability,&quot; with a &quot;overrepresentation of persons in wheelchairs, persons with mental or intellectual disabilities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Outcome, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employment of 6% of workers with disabilities, set in an Act of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest figures available, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3 percent,&quot; said Pierre White, Director General of the Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Evidence: the number of institutions &quot;taxed,&quot; as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and of 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The Act of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on the businesses,&quot; said Pierre White.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of firms with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What of happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Prior to face the Blues Tuesday evening (8.45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens has not hidden the pleasure that gives them this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It will not to write that there was complicity between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace. </seg>

<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to move forward,&quot; says of his side the Lillois. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As the contrastre between its benefits in club and selection, &quot;is a whole, it is justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;A Lille, I am throughout the year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;I must take my marks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Ménagé against Romania Friday evening for the match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for finally &quot;shine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without fail, however, the concept of &quot;fun.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2970"> The Blues, it encouraged since the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I&apos;ve always been bear,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> That is to further strengthen the &quot;character&quot; of this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Moreover, in front, &quot;there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;It sat in a moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Power play against them, it is only the happiness!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With bonhomie, Leekens has for its part referred to the &quot;pride.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; to contest &quot;a gala match.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; also to see-as a &quot;neighbor,&quot; that France is &quot;once again a very high-level team&quot; a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc made a work of thunder,&quot; he enthused. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will the next Euro, the technician would be well share the air with the Blues direction. Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our small Belgians are major,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> It is in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You will report at the next matches.&quot; The against France included. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> Portugal Paulo Bento began with many optimistic its dam return to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> On the go, both teams lacked realism. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento had been already, in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him, there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is to lever since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to rip down. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In view of the match go (0-0) Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears clear that the games are not facts. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but he was unable to score that goal if valuable, that would have relieved. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;It is a good result, which are, however, some risk because we have not been of purpose outside&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But among them, in the light of the Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to move, before an audience that should also be boiling, even if the party is obviously &quot;very tight,&quot; told by a Bento optimistic but lucid. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We expect a very tight match, but we are quite confident to take the upper hand,&quot; said the Portuguese coach for 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We continue to have a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012,&quot; still placed Carlos Queiroz&apos;s successor. </seg>

<seg id="3000"> &quot;It is a good result, which are, however, some risk because we have not been to but outside,&quot; regrets Bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualifications and have players with a lot of individual qualifications,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have entry intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not give them time to reflect.&quot; </seg>
