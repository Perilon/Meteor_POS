<seg id="1"> No releasing novelette for Tymoshenko through the parliament </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament refused the request today, to abolish within the framework of a novelette of the penal code the section on whose basis the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The representatives refused the new regulation which could have smoothed the way for the liberation of the arrested ex prime minister during the second reading of the request for easing of the punishments for economical offenses. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Timoshenko was supposedly in October one thing because of the end disadvantageous contract&apos;s with Russia about the purchase of natural gas to seven years of custody condemned. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not legal yet, in December the appointment of the convicted persons in court is supposed to be discussed. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as political revenge of the regime and also in the west the process made the suspicion of the prejudice of the court arise. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To remove the request, section 365 on whose basis the ex prime minister was condemned from the penal code was supported from 147 representatives. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 226 voices would have been necessary to his assumption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of the Libyan liberation fight or Libyan rebellion knows already their losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is past. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now only still the winners are to be defined. </seg>
<seg id="13"> How it this region usual, Islamisten triumph in the choices, the question is only, which - the moderate ones or the radical ones. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The National Temporary Council stood up for the common law of the Scharīʿa from which one has a certain idea really now with God. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya would become the country without criminality, because for theft one chops in a word the hand from. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Also women should forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, possible belief apostates become executed, and so wider. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of an only dictator becomes to tribes feuding with the society mutually from themselves in the future from the Koran geeint. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In a word - there will be an order in Libya, that would be in these parts hardly conceivable and particularly hardly desirable. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Only - our life-style is not now the only one and seen objective presumably neither the best and change would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is so seen rather astonishing, that the Muslim fighters made be helped anyway from the unbelieving dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Only the fact that the air raids of the NATO were led not by some general from America, but by Allah itself, whose omnipotence was praised to every successful hit, presumably likes to be used for their excuse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The winners in Libya? The west does not belong to that. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We participated only in a shot change, the interests of the Islam were used for and our politicians rid themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without this having brought some advantage. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we abandoned a military occupation of Libya more gladly. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Through that the local ones are a worry loosely - indeed the eviction of the crusaders. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Do the mineral oil enterprises get, however, the black gold to the trifling price also without occupation? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Presumably hardly and so the west can boast at last about the human rights once with right of his unselfishness as regards protection. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If the Scharīʿa-Vertreter do not spoil this to them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Beginning of a new crisis-era </seg>

<seg id="37"> The BIP of Germany increased as expected around 0.5%, that of France around 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Both countries corrected simultaneously their data for the second quarter, in the Germany a higher growth recorded, than initially had been expected (Growth around 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France was granting an easy drop around 0.1% (initial information spoke only of stagnation). </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Czech economy increased around 1.5 percent in the this year&apos;s third quarter in comparison with the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In comparison with the Vorquartal the gross domestic product, however, and aloud Tsch stagnated. The trend of the growth slow-down of the economical efficiency was confirmed to statistical office so. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The results are therefore worse than the predictions of the analysts are. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The most important events: </seg>
<seg id="43"> The Czech economy increased around 1.5 percent in the this year&apos;s third quarter in comparison with the previous year, in comparison with the preceded quarter it stagnated, however. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Provisional and seasonal according to information increased the German economy in the third quarter around 0.5 percent reckoned. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the entire euro zone and in the EU the economy recorded a growth between July and September opposite the preceded quarter around 0.2 percent, which the analyst agrees with the expectations. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The Greek economy shrank in comparison with the previous year around 5.2 percent. </seg>

<seg id="48"> The net yield of the Italian and Spanish state loans climbed up to their critical borders. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries begin to sense problems... </seg>
<seg id="50"> Less than 4% hold the net yield with Czech state loans to themselves even if the situation worsens in the region. </seg>
<seg id="51"> In Germany voices become loud, the EZB is supposed to become the believer of the last authority. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The Czechs qualified for EURO </seg>
<seg id="53"> In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate now their qualification for 200 million </seg>
<seg id="54"> The soccer selection mastered the most difficult task of the whole season! </seg>
<seg id="55"> Thanks to a well disposed goalkeeper Čech and a marvellous gate of Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0. </seg>
<seg id="56"> With a big portion of luck the Czech soccer could defend so his luxurious projection of the home match and will not be missing again once during the European championship. </seg>
<seg id="57"> IHNED.cz hunted the promotion tie in a detailed reportage. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Little excitement in the first half-time and a giant portion of luck in the second. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The Czech selection triumphed also thanks to the end weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech&apos;s and of the hero of the day of Jiráček in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and their ticket redeemed thus for the Fußball-EM. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Putting pressure on them the Montenegriner more also because of the precise defense game of the Czech Mannschaftkonnten only in the second half-time. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The unlucky fellows of the lot were Damjanovic and Vucinic which used up two giant chances. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech the Czech selection will mix therefore next year with the European championships, it is also pleasant that a premium flows towards the domestic soccer at the level of approx. 200 million. </seg>
<seg id="63"> From the first minutes quite combative soccer was played. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Both teams combined laboriously and so particularly the median was gambled. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Also in the second half-time the pressure of the home team was missing and the wide reductions in front of the penalty area were repelled by the Czech defense successfully. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Iranian students are ready to die for the kernel of their country. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You formed a living shield. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Some a Hundred College Students formed a living shield about around about a nuclear object in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="69"> With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for the kernel of their country in front of a possible Israeli attack. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The students had prayed Tuesday at Noon before the object and announced afterwards the USA and Israel the death. </seg>
<seg id="71"> A few hundreds of students of the university in the Iranian Isfahan formed on Tuesday a live shield about around around the core technology center in Isfahan in which uranium is worked. </seg>
<seg id="72"> When in this way they wanted to protect do, that they are ready, the kernel of their country, necessarily also with their own life. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The International atomic energy agency (IAEA) found recently in their report, Iran did not give up according to all appearance his endeavours towards a nuclear weapon for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Also in Israel talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Students had prayed at the noon in front of the entry to the complex and announced afterwards the USA and Israel the death. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In the case one thing for the purpose of led attack, largely to cripple the Iranian atomic program, would be also the atomic enrichment installation in Natans according to the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan attack objective. </seg>
<seg id="77"> The menu of a fat-addicted child: Does not frühstückt and eats sausage to the dinner </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with predominance at what 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Current proven inquiries - adipöse children come mostly from families with unhealthy life-style. </seg>
<seg id="80"> So it is proved again once how the environment in which he grows up and which examples which surround it are is importantly for the healthy development of a human being. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of adipöser children sausages stand up to half more frequently on the table, than in families in which standard measure important children live. </seg>
<seg id="82"> More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on day before of the clarification action under the motto &quot;Adipositas&quot; Chip to the dinner &quot;is not any coincidence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with fatties also sport does not number just among the favorite employments, what, however, also the majority affects the present pupils - only 15 percent answered, that their parents wenigsten once in the week of time for active movement find. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Inquiry among 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The inquiry occurred last year by the end of the school year, in this case almost 900 children were consulted from elementary schools in whole Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="86"> That was already the second age-group of the action &quot;Adipositas is not any coincidence&quot;, that is supported by the general health insurance and the society Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Up to now more than 12 thousand pupils participated in the project from 4th and 8th classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Unhealthy food and missing movement in the family are in this case decisive factors, that for those ones frightening increasing number of children with predominance or even obesity are responsible. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the consulted children mentioned for example, five times on day, to eat in the mode breakfast second breakfast lunch vespers dinner - one of the main assumptions for a healthy feeding, so one of the survey results says&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and sausage to the dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts refer, that also relative trifles, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, important for the healthy development of a child are. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In Czechia only 23 percent of the families of the pupils frühstücken, however. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And - in most families every alone for themselves frühstückt. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The determination was worst, which is not gefrühstückt in every tenth family at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is regarded in this case as a foundation stone of the healthy daily feeding. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The inquiry test brought among other things on the day, that one consumes much more often unhealthy chips in the families of overweight children. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everyone - without regard for the weight - drinks every day of sweet lemonades (70 percent) </seg>
<seg id="98"> Indeed more than 40 percent of the consulted children do sport, do only less, however, than half of their parents that - indeed only 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Put yourself together your own menu </seg>
<seg id="100"> A further part of the inquiry made to compile oneself their own food plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) possible. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;What Czech children between 12 and 15 as regards prefer to feeding is far away of the ideal of a healthy feeding. </seg>
<seg id="102"> There were a lot of farinaceous food, meat dishes and of course sweets among their favorite dish. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Alarming particularly the great popularity of sweet lemonades&quot; is&quot;, is stressed in the final report for this inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="104"> During the lunch, that is the main course, pastas triumphed just before poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The children did not like case fruits almost at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as lunches was very small. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Hinkehr for the health </seg>
<seg id="107"> Simultaneously the inquiry also showed, however, that the children are absolutely ready to change their eating habits if they get correct information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;With the control group of the inquiry participants, that the questionnaire&quot; on completion of the informative lecture &quot;Adipositas no coincidence is&quot; filled, a clear shift of the preferences was &quot;to be noted&quot; in many cases there to basic principles of the healthy feeding&quot;, is in the results of the project led. </seg>
<seg id="109"> This was obvious for example near the sweet lemonades, where many children began, usual water to give the priority. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children also much more often ticked off poultry or fish as a main course of the day in the questionnaire and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Pros claim - a stylist must be also a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introducing article above how stylists learn I had grumbled a little, that that a little to a lot of material for the beginning was. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There I did in the least not foresee, which still comes. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures of three pros from the branch, the clothing of problematic figures and a class above how that runs &quot;on the place&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is supposed to come still more badly. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The nearer the examination moves, around so more information and practical tasks stand us before. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course of everyone on Saturdays and on Sundays occurs, nevertheless it is fully busy. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we debated with directress Alena (no only man participates in the course) how one dresses a woman who does not have any figure proportioned ideally. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And those ones are after all most of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Ones have a too short neck, the others a too boyish figure without tidy curves and again others are cosy. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is a thing of the stylist to hide wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to conjure the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got also tips, as one a woman type as Jennifer Lopez - therefore with big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-accentuated puts on, without her working far too provocatively. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If for example the difference between waist and hips that the skirt or the trousers does really not like is so great, one should be able to tailor oneself at least a piece nach Maß. </seg>
<seg id="124"> One will surely not regret that, because clothing fitting well is simply exorbitantly expensive. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much indeed better, than in one of the pole, that continuously high- and slips, in the waist stands off, and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Boyish figures can take the liberty in turn to bear clothing with wrinkles, swelling, applications, embroideries or condensing process. </seg>
<seg id="127"> With this amount of information and figure types am I everything to make me gladly that I have a whole week of time go thoroughly through the head. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And in spite of that I am afraid, that it is almost not to be created faced with the homework put on. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the course participants got indeed a Promi assigned, for which they passende Outfits is supposed to think out - day clothing and evening robe. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We are supposed to consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type at that. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I am supposed &quot;to dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, who you know possibly from the campaign Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the Innern I cheer, because that is much better for me personally than to attract for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which recently presumably increased onto the a hundred kilos (na good, that is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We are supposed to cut the garments out of magazines or search Them in the Internet, print Them and work On them afterwards graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the &quot;Moodboard&quot; as the whole result is called our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic organization is supposed to be expressed then. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is very much indeed important to think also about the graphic page of the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist does not dress the models physically indeed only in that, but he designs also the so-called product page into that one journal&apos;s (after concrete handicap, for example trend handbags, coats, and so forth). </seg>
<seg id="137"> The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But that only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> That is, that a stylist must have a good comprehensive survey. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was seasoned by three visitors equally from the branch: </seg>
<seg id="141"> of the stylist Jan Pokorný, of the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us, that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able, to use this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And stylist sent in is able to work with a single clothing piece in very different way. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The charm word is called variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So one can carry for example a trench coat as usual above the jeans, therefore how a T-shirt or coat, one can carry it, however, also on the naked body, put on sale shoes for this purpose and carry it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It suffices, to roll up the sleeves or the collar and now the whole look looks very differently. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Plays with that&quot;, it stressed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The most the following council came, however, to me sitedly: &quot;First you must know the rules perfectly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Before then you may not hurt it&quot;, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> At last I realize, why we must drum all these theorems, what one with which can combine and why, also when one in fashion journals frequently very Different see gets. </seg>
<seg id="151"> To completely be silent from fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than finally he photographs. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Therefore one must be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speak ten Outfits) on stylen at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, that the clothing looks sometimes very different on the photo in combination with further Accessoires, than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all to the one must reckon therefore during the organization of the Outfits. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That sometimes image and Styl form half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> There one needs oneself only once Madonna, to look at a not just brilliant singer from whom image and marketing made a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Czechia one faces the services of a stylist rather reservedly. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also known personalities hold this frequently for flung money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look in this case is secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if makes already stylen somebody of us, we are supposed to count then, that it or it forces us with great probability a very different (smaller) size, as it or them in reality needs. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then one needs afterwards only still too googlen, in order to state with security that the gutter press writes the corresponding Promi decreased again too or, and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday onto the heart, not to believe that a stylist it needs to focus only on the fashion and &quot;to put together&quot; the Outfit then. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During his work it must communicate particularly with the people, which he stylt and he must be a smart psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Assess people, without toadying and his opinion support. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If some manageress appoints us in order to screen their wardrobe and in order to complement pretty pieces then we can clear their not the whole cupboard and say - my God, that is really terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;One must find at least a few praiseworthy things to which one recommends which one can carry for this purpose&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It showed us also very actually what must contain such a so-called &quot;place bag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Therefore such a bag that one buttons up at the waist and in which one carries all necessary Proprietäten with himself. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Except for such clear things, as scissors, dispenser to the hair-removing or safety pins contains it also such utensils, as a nylon thread (in this way the stylist helps out from products while photographing, as handbags or hat), specific clips with which the clothing is gathered behind if it is too large (Pins or other clips are forbidden so that the material does not go in a bust way) and of course sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So that we, however, do only not have to listen, but can practically try out also something, we learned, as one shoes correctly unterklebt. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Also while photographing in the studio, where the floor is now, one can damage the sole, let alone the outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Us o stuck and we stuck... </seg>
<seg id="173"> On the scissors one must not even touch the shoes so that one does not damage it. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Therefore one must really proceed skillfully. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario pleased me when he praised my &quot;creation&quot; without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The mentioned skilfulness is just not indeed my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only the fraction of that, what we at to hear at the second weekend continuation course got. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Meanwhile I realized one thing - to dedicate oneself to the styling on professional level, no children&apos;s game is. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need for Speed: &quot;The Run&quot; - the illegal race right through America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> The initially careless journey becomes the routine journey to the early shift through a series of completely avoidable, dilettante errors. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Succeeded indeed in fulfilling the aspirations to the big part however what already uses that if nobody fancied obviously doing more a little. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Already before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle &quot;The Run&quot; woke high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised nevertheless, to move a piece again into a new dimension the already aged game series &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and in the game cash demonstration examples it did not seem in fact to be only one thing of many Action running-games. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as the fit passages turn out in which the main protagonist climbs from the car and goes on on foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as one is already accustomed it at NFS, many things are different in the final effect than one had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Secure - quite decent arcade races are it potential, but in total the game of some superfluous errors that are present for more or less already a few years in this series is curtailed. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Therefore it is actually no errors more, but rather signs of a basically inscrutable laziness of the game developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> First time that has problems of personal character, certain of central figure Jack, one is introduced in the history; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race right through America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, therefore at the west coast, one sits down at the steering wheel - with the task, when first to be in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty single races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> That means that every race is delivered on other stretch and that the single stages occur in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> One does not have any moment the impression, that game would offer the same thing again and again. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some surroundings are to be looked at for this purpose still distinctly prettily although the technical level of the graphic does not exceed that of the former parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore world-traveling nothing. </seg>
<seg id="198"> However the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscape or highly above through deeply snow-covered landscape wirk visually very much pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Occasionally atypical elements bring a little change into the single races. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert for example one is surprised by a desert storm which restricts the view strongly. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains in turn one must look out infernally, that one is spilled not of an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Incidentally the single races are quite well built-in behind each other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Indeed only a few, give it, however. </seg>
<seg id="204"> One attempts a while so, to overtake the stipulated number of opponents (basically a classical race), then one has to make up time (classical race against the stopwatch), then another personal duel with an only opponent expects one. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And for this purpose also still the police interfere which wants to vermasseln one the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Passages in which Jack leaves the car are a novelty. </seg>
<seg id="207"> In this case it is a question rather of certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from somebody and where the player must help him when it presses the correct button in the correct moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Therefore nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It surprises, however, that there are many less of such passages in the game than one would expect (actually presumably only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> This of the thing is final rather for the advantage, because so this element does not have at least any chance to become boring - it belongs in the context to the one above said to the elements that make the game more varied. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The going-model strides into the footprint of the preceded parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That is, seen from present focal point, it does not come off indeed any trees, on the other hand one could not say it was bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Who searches realistic simulations must look around elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But the local going-model is raked also furthermore very well to an action-loaded running-driving, although one improves with the competition could find. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then everything is so far in best order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems emerge first after certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the going-model the collision model is completely not O.K. </seg>
<seg id="218"> It is hardly to be expected of a game of this way, in which the car behaves that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, however, if one does practically not have before any strike onto any object presentiment, then everything is not obvious all right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typical example: In the case of the narrow overhauling or passing by at complying cars one &quot;touches&quot; the other car only easily at some places, in other, almost identical situation one, however, comes into the centrifuging and turns wild pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or the cart goes now to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the restart system that does not keep on forming indeed anything, off annoyed it is always. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The restarts are so solved: if one has total loss or lands it far off the stretch, the game throws back one then onto the last clue of the stretch. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every race one has only five restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If one has emptied it, everything starts from front.. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The restarts are therefore rather something as an aid, for the case, that something does not succeed, but should leave on that one more gladly not. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes the restart does not help, however, once, there nothing else helps than to learn the critical section from the head. </seg>
<seg id="227"> It is distinctly unpleasant that the same things often happen at the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> One must go through some curves for example in very specific way, otherwise one does simply not fit through. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere one always encounters at the corresponding place of &quot;civilian&quot; car in same configuration, regardless, whether one when first or fifth, five seconds formerly or a minute later comes. </seg>
<seg id="230"> That is annoyed especially in situations if one sees that the opponent in front of one passes playing at two complying cars, however until one arrives even there, the cars are already in such a position, that one must umfahren or slow her down. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is the same, when one arrives there, everything it is indeed so designed that it results in this situation always thickly before your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have even further advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> In the whole game there are a few places, where one is always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and also here again without regard for the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This to the end of the game is maddest on the long bridge which one crosses in opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must overtake one obviously here onto devils komm from that. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if it is then before one already once, it takes the view from one of course then so that one drives the own car there a few times at the beginning in Klump. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Klar - one wants to make the game simple more thrillingly and more excitingly but this intention is so clear, that they one fast the joy of the game vermiest. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that is pitiful, because in spite of simpler going-model the game is quite in total entertainedly and occasionally also so action-loaded that one does almost not know where the head suits one anymore. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And basically is the same, what is &quot;guilty&quot; at that - that draft&apos;s with fifty unique routes, the order of the races in a way, that no boredom can arise, or something very else... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> One must not look over in this case the service stations at the stretch, because just here one can change the car although in most cases the car that one just has suffices. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are subdivided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports cars are suitable for the urban fields good, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the zigzags in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also the task mode (Challenges) goes - therefore the races in the single Lokalitäten that one knows from the history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here it gives to gain not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile that is together for the tasks (Challenges) and the history. </seg>
<seg id="246"> In order to reach for the higher driver level, different objects must be revealed: begun by the car, up to which background&apos;s for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is simultaneously on-line function car log with that one united, that compares the own achieved results with those of other players among other things and guarantees also for further collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of further unintelligible carvers is a situation in the last race of the history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here one comes indeed into a subway-tunnel (because of me), where one long races in the dark on the rails (because of me), by car. </seg>
<seg id="250"> On the speedometer digits look between 150 a 200 k.p.h. (because of me), however there a subway comes at the same time from behind and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial staff we will argue presumably still long about that, whether that was a black-out of the game framers or whether the authors hold us for so stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical page is not overwhelming anything but at least the visual general impression is right in most cases addressing and here and there even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> The more annoyed is, that at some thrilling moments the refresh frequency becomes slower and this sometimes quite dramatic. </seg>
<seg id="254"> That affects, however, in particular the accidents with greater number of involving, where one a continuous pour point&apos;s in any case nothing is useful. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sound reproduction is O.K so far. and the soundtrack is matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In the Call In for speaking to a scale of rather young public as wide as only possible a soundtrack a lá &quot;of everyone&quot; arose &quot;a little&quot; - however who such game is bought already because of the music?! </seg>
<seg id="257"> The general impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game was not curtailed by the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have asserted ourselves with the breast clay of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But so the game seems somehow incomplete. </seg>
<seg id="260"> At for themselves a klasse pleasure, however one should be prepared on these errors with the Power of airport floodlights pricking to one into the eyes. </seg>

<seg id="276"> EU ambassadress Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have the call of Negativisten and euro sceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The contract of Lisbon brought the balance noticeably of the plumbline under the single institutions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not have expected that such hard war breaks out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It becomes to five, six years&quot; Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassadress near the European Union, quite sharply their lecture at the Juridical Department, began &quot;to last until the waves will polish themselves and &quot;will have become accustomed to their new role all&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How she takes the motto seriously &quot;via Europe &quot;Understandably and openly showed it already in the first part of their lecture in which she succeeded in describing to the EU and to their mutual relationships onto one the single organs such a clear and understandable manner that some reader of the Juridical department of the Karlsuniversität would have it for that can envy. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Ms Vicenová praised in this case also the new constant chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;At the beginning criticism became loud, it is too inconspicuous - a gray official that did not grow to such a role, but I must say it left without all the breath as he took care of the thing well. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a human being that manages it to communicate with them to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently and that has particularly clear ideas of how it is supposed to go on with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and security politics declared it then in response to the question: Who that is actually - the European Union? Which number I am supposed &quot;to call&quot;?, therefore as an important step to the agreement and better readability the EU politics opposite states, as e.g. China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel </seg>
<seg id="287"> Ms Vicenová dedicated herself also to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lives and to live in near future proposes. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech chairmanship of two years ago described they as success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and organized also the summit conference for Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She referred to the case of the government during the chairmanship as large Negativum which damaged the image of the Czech Republic strongly. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU has to do currently all hands fully. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Said with the words of the ambassadress, it presented itself quite hectic not only with the chairmanship, but also during the subsequent crisis which is not overcome until today yet. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there the EU must be approved of still the seven year budget, what the thing just because of the present economical situation does a lot complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it of a slender and economical budget becomes which branches of trade receive priority which countries more and which one less are supported - all this stands now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassadress reminded also of their own slogans with which it came to Brussels: &quot;Understandable above Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;If I do not like something, it is horrible abbreviations, external words and jargon, then that does not understand anybody. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As I am supposed to know as a citizen actually, whether one in Brussels really crooked or round cucumbers and thinks out different large bananas or whether anyone wants to forbid us the Quargel in fact. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It would have used the ground of the EU also gladly for in order to get more Czechs into European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> To Europe of the two of them or different speeds in prospect </seg>
<seg id="300"> In opinion of the EU ambassadress the Czechs stand in the call, to be a euro sceptic, that more the negative ones, perceive as the positive pages of the thing. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The weak representation of Czechs is the more annoyed in European Institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> At that many factors are guilty, among other things also the restraint of our candidates, whose impotence, to write motivation letters and last but not least also the weak support of the Czech page. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Except for the successful Czech chairmanship it emphasized also the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad-Gruppe, the so-called V4. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;You believe me if one comes to Pole or to Hungarian to me and is a Slowake near the Frenchman means then next to me: &quot;He, what connects her the heads there - that is already again your V4?&quot; and in this case a quite acid expression does. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Ms Vicenové the EU in future expect particularly hard rules for the budget-politics of the member states. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As much more real, she sees the draft of a Europe as a &quot;European confederation&quot; the two or really different speeds at. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries off the euro zone here. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen-room and we have already the institute of a confirmed cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time it was said that only the countries are supposed to cooperate that want it and that, that do not want it are supposed to stand quiet off.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be more and more of such institutions which finally comes to a strong Europe of the different speeds&quot;, expects Ms Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect she appreciated the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the basic principle also for the role, according to which all topics with effect on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states and not only of the countries of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Fire story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The Innovator IBM comes into the second century of his existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> One wanted to search for a suitable word, that the strategy of IBM in a most exact way characterizes, then would be this presumably the word &quot;longevity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the wide public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as modern enterprise although since his foundation already a century has passed by. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Already their first head put the basis for this longevity - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already it represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could be solved easily for itself if the people were ready to think a little. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; became like this to the trademark, around which the life of the future giant should happen (and simultaneously for the title of the internal magazine which one began near IBM already in the year 1935 to hand over). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the enterprise culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;Meant for us from IBM this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement in the direction of future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was successful also therefore a whole century because it remained loyal to his principles and shied away not from changing everything else everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That allowed to transform us, in the course of our first century, the technologies, the business and also the society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope, which we create still more in the next a hundred years&quot;, Samuel J. Palmisano, the present director of the enterprise, said on the occasion of the anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="324"> System thought over </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson practiced already in the thirties social care of his employees - in similar way, as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM-people had paid vacation, an insurance, as one of the first American employees through the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a compensation system thought over for best innovator and Händler. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Also the long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are just as worked out. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The enterprise was from the beginning brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM disconnected any Diskrimination - and could select itself correspondingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In accordance with this antidiscrimination strategy also the present plan is, that Palmisan at the top of IBM in the next year of a woman is taken turns - of Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> That one is there already thirty years near IBM, up to now it took the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing and strategy leader one. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM does in the last years so-called online-brainstormings which many future strategies and innovations arise from. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No miracle - there are ideas enough, in the enterprise really almost half a million of people is busy. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good call </seg>
<seg id="333"> Your unshakeable position in the business guarantees a strong image and this to inside and according to Außen to the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning IBM rather had the draft of an institution, as a bare technology enterprise&quot;, Economist told that one the professor about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School and the authoress of a book. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is no technology-enterprise, but a company that helps to solve business problems with the aid of technologies&quot; added George Colony of consulting-company Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the enterprise itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - mentioned &quot;Big Blue&quot; in the states because of their logo familiarly, grew up in a century to one of the greatest enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most varied technology-enterprises anyway - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> From all American technology-enterprises IBM has most patents and already five of his employees were honored with the Nobel prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> E.g. bank automats, credit cards, finance swap, bar code or also the floppy disk belong to his best known inventions. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approx. 220 billion dollars of market value (Market capitalization) IBM was this year the second-largest technology enterprise (now according to Apple), at which it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The look ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations found the taste of the customers from today - for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers of IBM PC were unhappy jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Business is based on the forward motion, therefore one must not &quot;commit&quot; oneself to the past emotionally&quot;, Samuel J. Palmisano thinks about that. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore IBM does not have any problem to build his foundation walls on different platforms - and to leave it also again when they do not function. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike the opponent Microsoft who stands in the principle with his operating system Windows and falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> Services participate in the profits of IBM in greatest measure, software and hardware are involved to in each case a fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Hardware with one was in this case in another 1990 more than fifty per cent part most strongly represent. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000 IBM disposed of few assets throwing off profit to the value of 15 billion dollars, invested at the same time it, however, 58 billion dollars into the purchase of future-pregnant technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> IBM goes on with these Investionen also after 2008 when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Also here IBM, which increased his investment extent right in the great world economy crisis, remained loyal to the legacy of his first head Thomas J. Watson. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Up to now it shines, that the IBM enterprise survives the present crisis regardless of. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the IBM-stocks went up since 2008 around 120 percent missile-like and the clear profit of the enterprise increases kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The enterprise slogan of IBM says: everything can be changed - only the values not. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also therefore it may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM-history: Of the cheese tailor to cosmos flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> The a hundred years ago in New York founded IBM society (International business Machines) had at the beginning a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> It took over the IBM name only in 1924 - initially it was a question of a brand denomination for a subsidiary in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The fusion put the foundation stone to the later IBM society from four enterprises whose history goes back until the eighties of the 19th century. </seg>
<seg id="361"> You had technologies as for example the famous pricking card clocks for the registration of the work beginning and end. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new enterprise, that to 1930 also the chairmanship in the supervisory board inne had. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint who employed the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson so that this helped him with the management of the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This Leader outshone even the founders of IBM then - the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise is based on Watson&apos;s ideas until today. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson guided the enterprise to 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, began as already the name betrays with the production and the marketing of all possible machines for the trade - of sausage-and cheese tailors, up to cash boxes. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In the first four decades in which Watson guided the company it doubled their turnovers on nine million dollars and the enterprise expanded little by little onto all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> It was so indispensable to Watson for the company that he sat for whole forty years in the chief armchair only then he became from his son, removed Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his management IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also the first programming language developed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the sixties flights helped technician and computer from IBM of the NASA with leading into the space - to the Mercury and Saturn and in the year 1969 also the famous flight of the human being to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile IBM developed in the year the first computer family with same computer architecture in 1964 - the row of IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> A classical PC which determined the computer-standard of that time came to the market in the year 1981 under the name of IBM 5150. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM disposed to the Chinese society Lenovo of his computer production, on the other hand she bought, however, the consultant part of the enterprise PricewaterhouseCoopers and she got fully with that and very into the business with consulting services and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy, that IBM in the last three years is been worthwhile the draft &quot;Smarter Planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The intention to use technologies in clever way in fields up to now not even planned embodies it e.g. also for the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the city administration. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the commercial sector IBM imported recently the platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; which is supposed to help the traders with leading the entire commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history also in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In already 1932 IBM founded a subsidiary in the former Czechoslovakia - as a first country in central and east Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today IBM ČR practices among other things also a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for central and east Europe settles in Prague and here there is also a top team of researchers of world level, that dealt with the technology of the voice recognition. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Darina Rychtářová above their unfaithful husbands: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Iveta - this donkey can keep you you, I do not want it anymore! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now end is! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After their spouse Josef Rychtář (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartosová (45) had become their lover, Darina remained still the hope that Josef awakes from his pink dream and comes home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, now it is final past with the patience and for the further life she set herself clear rules. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Josef can come home, however not more than my partner&quot;, declared D. Rychtářová. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Bartosová had offered refuge in their own house, she would presumably not have remembered once in the dream how that with their husband ends. </seg>
<seg id="388"> As Iveta onto their pushing there after 30 days again aus- and back according to Říčany pulled, accompanied like Josef. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Yes it confessed even public, that he loves it. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Darina resigned with the time, yes it seemed even, as if she wants to make up with their unfaithful husband again - finally now, however, it gave him the race passport. </seg>
<seg id="391"> It is Rychytář regardless with whom his wife sleeps </seg>
<seg id="392"> If nevertheless Rychtář Iveta Bartosová in future should leave, he will surely receive pauper not open at home then. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to conclude his days in our common home, I will not hinausjagen it then.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;However not as an old donkey gotten lost more loved, but as a human being to whom I still have certain links&quot; Ms Rychtářová betrayed; she also said, however, she separated from it already emotionally and insist only on mutual correctness. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The circumstance, that it of Darina the back door has bolted, Josef supports up to now with dignity. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I respect the decision of my wife.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I stay with Iveta together, nothing is changed at that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My wife wants a paper-marriage and I respect that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="399"> &quot;The company runs, I see to the repairs, the garden, the plot, I do the purchases.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="400"> &quot;With Darina I talk in a very normal way, we do not divide only the bed now&quot;, J. Rychtář (the leaf) said Blesk. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If a new love wants to be searched to Darina, it does not want to hinder her at that then. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;We do not sleep with each other, therefore it is regardless to me whether she has a friend or who that is. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is clear to me that that is my fault, I fell with Iveta in love and therefore I take over any responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst feminine bad habits: How does it stand with you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If one asks the men to name some typical feminine bad habits, they joggle some without exception promptly then from the sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Loves women, you recognize themselves in the following lines, in which we make a few bad habits pass revue again, that make to the men the blood in the veins boil? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchase addiction </seg>
<seg id="408"> Does their husband reproach them to be purchase-addicted? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Must you buy at least a quarrel for yourself weekly? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Go shopping gladly and may it be also identical a little more in the case of actions? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then it is presumably really a question in your case of a weakness. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are at least conscious of that to themselves and attempt to hold their purchase pleasure to some extent under control. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But hand onto the heart, which woman already tolerates it, to hang about in search of an outerwear fitting well only so through a dress business and not to try oneself out now all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women, for the men it is often the pure hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Nevertheless they consider how they already often said to their husband once - stay you once more gladly outside... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too fat&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I would have to lose at least five kilos - I am supposed to start jogging or doing gymnastics&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;You like me anyway&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="420"> That occurs to them in an anyhow best known way? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then belong presumably also to the women who are regular proprietarily from how they look. </seg>
<seg id="423"> That is for a long time not that you are supposed to make go, however, many men react to that allergically if their wife complains about their appearance constantly. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex agrees agreed - with increasing frequency of the complaints the women are increasingly more incompatible. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and cleanness at first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is a fight against windmills. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Windows clean, boarding and dust wipe, scrub the tub - and this at least twice weekdays. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Do you swear at their partner because he stamps again once onto the clean tiles, you the children chide, with dirty shoes because the just scrubbed wash basin is already again dirty and because the glass door has at the living room cupboard already again fingerprints, where nevertheless the polishing does so much effort? </seg>
<seg id="429"> You should suffer from this kind &quot;of Devianz&quot;, then you should know, that one must not exaggerate anything and that order and not suit cleanness in the family life at first place. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Finally this immoderate purity fad can damage also the mutual relationships and particularly the rest in the family. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Burins </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Dirty gym trousers come into the clothes-basket.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You really want to put on the old socks tomorrow once again&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;One does simply not fling a wet towel onto the floor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised, that that exasperates him. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Clearly that is not badly meant, nevertheless they only want, which has everything his order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> If the men knew this, the women did not need to grumble possibly so much then. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Gossip and gossip </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women clap and gossip gladly, there whispers behind the back or even slanders or one forges alliances. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are now focalized on relationships, therefore they gossip gladly about such topics, as for example - who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Presumably everyone of us women is ready with a little harmless gossip and gossip. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand onto the heart - that is particular to presumably all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> That is not to be mixed up, however, with gossips of coarsest caliber, that nothing and nobody is holy, that despise presumably everyone in their surroundings and that represent a considerable danger especially for woman collectives. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr and Voráček helped to Philadelphia with their assistances to the victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr had great part during the Monday game of the NHL with two assistances at the 5: 3-Triumph from Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and again most productive Czech player is through that in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine year old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and was proclaimed to the best player of the match. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Other player Jakub Voráček recorded two assistances in the same game also to Jágr&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jágr said to the game opposite journalists he prophesied a large evening to Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Already before the game says I it, that he succeeds in a Hattrick today.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> I had that somehow in the feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Occasionally such a feeling overcomes one&quot;, declared Jágr after whose action&apos;s Giroux already with the first shot the Flyers achieved a gate. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A little later also the second hit had &quot;a Czech track&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček erkämpfte the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second in front of the Abpfiff of the first third the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a Short-Hander, but the second third belonged then to the Flyers again. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Concrete Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr it achieved his third hit, after that Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth gate. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I do not want to say that he is the best player of the league, but determined he belongs to the best three&quot;, Jágr appreciated his center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;It would not be liked to me in the life that I play with such an ice hockey player together to the end of my career as with it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;That pleases me gigantically.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I cut my game open I to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All the years in the NHL my other players set their game for me and now the spit turns itself round&quot; Jágr smiled. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina still turned game into the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again once Dwyer that continued from a punishment shot it came to a gate here. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt read prevented, however, every further complication, in which it was successful in majority two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Distinguished Pronger still acted in our zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He caught the puck, I incorporated journey and (Read) drew to remoter posts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I attempted to meet him and am glad that it banged&quot;, Voráček described the last hit of the lot from his view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Through this victory Philadelphia sat down at the top of the eastern conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček hurt himself in the game against Buffalo and departed in the second third because of an injury at the upper body from. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens expiated next to theirs Beck finds out also their leadership one unlost in the Penalty-firing 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomás Plekanec could not change one of the punishment shots. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team presumably the high illness-conditional loss on the defensive - they played the game only with five defenders to end. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;That is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played the meeting only with an only practised player to end, young players were the rest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there nothing can be set off, in this way we must become ready&quot;, said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;At every change an attack wave after the other one and we did not have to counter that with anything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We would have had to make the game simpler and bring the puck from our third.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> Here there were still reserves&quot;, thought P. K. Subban, one of the defenders. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec repelled thirty shots of Tampa Bay and carried so leading to the 5: 2-Triumph over Winnipeg at. </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the jets which ended a series of five defeats with that five different shooters had part. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of the travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> To 1989 there were in the former ČSSR only five granted state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agencies sold then only journeys into the socialist East-bloc countries particularly, into the west might then only Chosen. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so Czech tourists traveled onto the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic republic - the GDR), into the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania onto the Black Sea and to Hungary onto the Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A bright exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia broke a prowestern course and therefore the journeys were restricted to Yugoslavia strongly. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of those socialist times was it, that it was allowed not even citizens of the East bloc (therefore also the Czechoslovac), to travel within the framework of the socialist countries freely. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen of the ČSSR to poles or really wanted to travel for example individually to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter to that then, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Already then the travel agencies offered also journeys into the west, then one had to accept, however, gigantic snakes or stay also at the sleeping bag the night before the travel agency, and/or have at least &quot;good acquaintances&quot; in the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Also so the thing had long yet not worked. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called currency promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was given to only &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others were not allowed to travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not indeed a freely exchangeable currency, without currency promise it would have been therefore impossible to get the necessary finance means (western currency) for a journey into the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The from far away meisten Czechs did not transfer their vacation at home, any miracle, that the Czechs bought themselves innumerable weekend houses and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today. </seg>
<seg id="493"> A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 onto the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> During to 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs transferred in the last year 4.5 million of their foreign vacations into countries of the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A tremendous paradox that one is not more conscious today at all is the fact, that one into the currently most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until in 1989 at all could not travel because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Resemble from the beginning of the nineties of the last century the currency duty into the adjacent west-European countries was canceled, which caused a tremendous wave of short visits particularly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechoslovacs could simply not get long time of their journeys into the west enough, everyone wanted to have been at least a few days there. </seg>
<seg id="498"> So the Czech holiday-makers slept in the case of journeys to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had then already the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a retirement. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature at trips abroad of Czechs was then a trunk vollgepackter with canned food, beer and continuous sausage and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="500"> A further important milestone was the introduction freely that one exchangeable Czech&apos;s crown - after decades our tourists could buy the western currency freely at last. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our life level and through that also the average salaries went up, which einmündete in 1997 into a further important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demands for journeys the travel agencies began after 1997 to prepare journeys through charter flights through which the air trips verbilligten thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts in comparison with the past incredibly regularly. </seg>
<seg id="503"> The Czechs, except for the USA, already currency-free payments with all sophisticated countries of the world, had end of the nineties which made the travel even simpler. </seg>
<seg id="504"> It resulted in the year 2000 in a further interesting moment in the history of the &quot;mail-samtenen&quot; traveling than thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight into an exotic country was dispatched - to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then annually direct charter-airplanes with Czech passengers fly into far remote sunny countries; this year one flies directly from Czechia to twelve exotic Destinationen. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Onto the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually to exotic countries! </seg>
<seg id="507"> A further significant moment in the epoch which characterized our &quot;postrevolutionary&quot; development came in the year 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17th November 2008 the visa duty for Czech tourists through which our country joined definitively under the sophisticated countries of the world picked up the USA. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In the year 2008 the Czechs spent in their history for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time it gave for a single vacation stay including the costs at the vacation place of more than 15 Tsd. CZK per person from. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairperson - again a stalemate threatens. </seg>
<seg id="511"> For already almost five months the Czech soccer has no chairperson and it threatens in this case that the successor will be not confessed from Ivan Hasek at the top of the Czech soccer association (FAČR) even after the exceptional general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Until today there is not indeed yet any agreement according to which election regulation people are supposed to choose. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without these at all no vote is possible about the three potential successors. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech soccer - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June Hasek resigned from his function, at which he had asked his colleagues with the resignation to that to agree and to find a strong personality that can lead the soccer in future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the era according to Hasek the old squabbles between the two association chambers that can not agree on a common candidate broke out once again. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was proved klipp and clearly on 16th September, when the new chairperson should be selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegatees of the general meeting had come very for nothing into the nation house in the Prager quarter of Smíchov, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not a question only of the choice in this case self. </seg>
<seg id="519"> One could not agree indeed once on who is actually voice-entitled during the full collection - only the statutes-moderate representatives or also the officials endowed with a proxy. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this only point one achieved at least partial agreement which also the recommendation of the institute for state and right in whose opinion a representation is not admissible on proxy basis contributed to. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The quarrels around the election regulation keep on lasting, however. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Also the executive committee did not bring more clearness into the thing, at whose meetings - regardless, whether tidy or exceptional - basically nothing at all other more on the agenda stands. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the opinions were changed with respect to the choice of a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same one. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question says: how is one supposed to proceed in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate-situation? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The quarrel point affects the question whether one is supposed to proceed in agreement with the statutes, or whether a very different model must be found&quot; Dusan Svoboda set, one of the three deputy chairpersons of the FAČR firm, that represents the pro soccer in the management. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to statutes-moderate model the candidate who receives the bigger prozentuelle support in the chamber for which he presents himself triumphs in the third round. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is supposedly readily to pay attention to the compromise that the candidate triumphs who receives the higher voice number from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech page in turn exists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two third majority with this prozentuellen voice counting. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Then the two qualifying round does not have at all any sense anymore this mode would &quot;question&quot; the entire two chamber draft, the election regulation does not understand Svoboda the objections of the mährischen page that would find it best bend, but to choose according to valid statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Also Tomás Paclík agrees to that surprisingly even if it emerges that the statutes-moderate election regulation presumably comes of all candidates at the ehesten towards Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;It is my wish that according to the statutes people largely choose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;In this way no senseless replacement variants are thought out, as during the last general meeting&quot;, the owner (the soccer club) declared Victoria to Plzeň that presents himself for the first time and distanced himself in his comments opposite particularly Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains, however, optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In his opinion the new chairperson will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate also constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification of the national team for the Fußball-EM on the present day would surely contribute to smoothing of the feelings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;If the soccer rides first on the euphoric wave, also the willingness to the cooperation is greater then&quot;, thinks the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experiences from all three adepts and this both on professional, as also regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more reserved there. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately conflicting.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;That is not a thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts &quot;to bend&quot; the rules to own purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;Therefore a renewed blocking is not impossible during the general meeting.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope, however, for finally the healthy human intellect triumphing&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - a lot of time for the understanding of all pages does not remain more. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should happen supposedly directly in Montenegro, however who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be anyway complete up to the qualification game. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charter flight stuff with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl according to Podgorice should fly among other things could not set off at the morning into Prague because of a technical trouble at all and so one sought feverishly according to a replacement variant how one to bring a part of the executive committee nevertheless still onto the venue of the bar rage first leg. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Finally nevertheless presumably the meeting to which it is supposedly supposed to come on Wednesday is then decisive on minister level. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobes, the minister of school beings, youth and body education would have convinced the fissured parties of an agreement gladly within the biggest sport association of the country. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It stands a lot indeed on the game: state allowances, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech soccer and also the pending general meeting of the ČSTV which is supposed to show the new direction to the Czech sport according to the finance problems from Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into the fight around the position of the chairperson because he does not see any suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> When Tomás Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers in front of the exceptional general meeting a strong candidate that would have filled to all his ideas about the new chairpersons of the soccer association to the Czech republic (FAČR) could have formed he would not have accepted the fight for this top position at all. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there was a good candidate, I would fight for it then and renounce the choice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the present situation did not succeed in finding such an adept&quot;, said Paclík ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for Paclík, to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, is to prevent it therefore, that the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta that top of the FAČR reaches. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that he proposes in the case of his victory to carry out the function of the chairperson only a year therefore to 2013, up to the appointment the tidy general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of the chairperson he would have found out one gladly top manager seen, that is not knitted all too much into the soccer event. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;With some relevant people I personally spoke.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> Hardly to believe that some said to me they did not want to identify currently with the Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such opinions would have changed gladly&quot;, he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="558"> The most out of everything Paclík supposedly interrupts the connection Pelta&apos;s with the chairperson of the Pilsner district soccer association novel Berbr, a man with controversial call that is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegatee votes on general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason, that Pelta would have the position of the chairperson inne. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;With his victory the present state would be conserved and in the Czech soccer it would not precede at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The support through Berbr, one clever Businessman, would agree with the soccer twice badly&quot;, emphatical Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> With that it alludes also to Pelta&apos;s name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen for the determination in a Korruptionsaffaire which Pelta, however, punishment-freely followed from falling. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta to the (tsch.) Soccer should bring in.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how we would &quot;stand&quot; in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA&quot;, said řekl Paclík, his former saying, &quot;he will sell the Pilsner soccer club if Pelta becomes chairperson&quot; nevertheless already a little calm sees. </seg>
<seg id="565"> If Paclík should triumph in the Thursday choice, he can absolutely imagine, however, a future cooperation with Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just the same also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl that Paclík in front of the general meeting in October had supported that ended with a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great abilities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine it well for example as a head of the national team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But I do not believe that it is able to guide the association as managers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;Nevertheless I do not put my nose into matters which I do not know anything about&quot;, said Paclík who had guaranteed for sensation in September with his being in front behind the recall of the referee commission with Luďěk Macela, who Dagmar Damková replaced. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík himself claims, he feels increased to the role of the association chairperson. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And refers in this case to his abilities with the management from private companies, since last summer he is also a head of Pilsen that celebrated the first triumph with his support in May in the league. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the Power in order to change something in the soccer environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;In order to restrict the influence of certain pressure groups that tend dazu to influence Disziplinar- and appointment commissions what degenerates until disgusting situations&quot;, Paclík mentioned that does not do any secret from his antipathy for example towards the Sparta-leader Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> He would regard as one of his priorities the Festigung of the relationships between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help it would become with the political top politicians lobbyieren, that more money flows from the lottery tax into the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;That is one of the decisive things which the new chairperson should dedicate himself to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it results in the taxation of luck games how the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, then they must say, however, where the money goes also klipp and clearly&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclík does also not regard his connection to the Pilsner club as Handicap although he himself stresses the chairperson of the FAČR must be &quot;überparteilich&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta in turn is united with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;That is just not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> A lot of sense does not do to my opinion, however, either, to transmit my stocks to a third person hypocritically in the Pilsner club in order to return after one and a half years again&quot; Paclík explained. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would exclude a stalemate-situation in the future. </seg>
<seg id="584"> One of the candidates for the chairperson office, that is Miroslav Pelta, promised two days in front of the general meeting of the soccer association it will look strong in the case of his choice for that, that the FAČR gets new statute, that in future exclude quarrels about the election regulation from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign will the Czech selection surely defuse itself with a possible success. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta had promised already before the not realized choice in September, he wants to concentrate in the case of his choice on the national team and the production of finance means. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided first onto the last moment, to participate in the choice before the last general meeting and so the two month long pause liked to help him, to defend and to introduce in a wider context his ideas about the management of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People on all levels dedicate themselves to the soccer, they are impatient and they expect therefore that the chairperson is known on Thursday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;He feels that it is highest time, the man that is united particularly with the Jablonecer club that but also many years near Sparta and in the executive committee acted thinks that the association is guided by somebody. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also therefore it thinks that it has sufficient experiences in order to lead the Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced, that for the present problems with the choice the euphoria that prevailed at times of Ivan Hasek is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately statutes which were not as complete as they all had picked up were approved of during the general meeting in June. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they had allowed interpretations not different, we would have &quot;had&quot; from September already a chairperson&quot;, thought Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Just the reworking of the most important document of the civil union it used as baits for the delegatees. </seg>
<seg id="595"> I &quot;should&quot; become &quot;chairperson, then I take care of that personally and am to bear responsibility personally readily if it does not bang.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;That is a fundamental thing without which he can not be&quot;, says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Furthermore he does not attempt to distance oneself opposite his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Already formerly it had announced he can imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl that he acknowledges because of his juridical education and knows good that his opponent would be his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It which did not let in turn any dry thread at Pelta did already long not attack also Tomás Paclík anymore. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In the soccer he moves himself already over a year and can refer already to certain successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were, however, reducing and many people were shocked from his choice campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;Also therefore doubt now a lot of at his real character&quot;, addressed Pelta his opponent that remains loyal to presumably his Proklamierungen that have expressed it already in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In his opinion his strongest arm is the knowledge of the soccer of the lowest game classes, up to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the sign of Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;I would make an effort also for ending all Affairen - of the Causa of Bohemians, up to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of the last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Now after that I would become me on negotiations with the private and state sector&quot; the forty-six year old candidate ČTK two months ago said &quot;to fall in order to guarantee sufficient finance means for the whole soccer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech soccer will not mean any staff purges. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would have to vertraut machen first once with the job definition of all employees&quot;, he said in the direction to Strahov, where there is nervousness due to the long anarchy understandably. </seg>
<seg id="609"> In spite of the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios who accompany the pending general meeting he believes that the delegatees do not go on Thursday for nothing according to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point in dispute should really be how one chooses in the third round then we get over that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;The soccer needs plausibility and it recovers that one only through that if he has a new Leader at last&quot; Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins under it to work in a hard way </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the previous deputy chairperson Jindřich Rajchl should be elected as the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech Republic on the general meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly become to many people in the association the mood vermiesen. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises indeed that one begins in the case of his choice to work in a hard way. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for single soccer fields. </seg>
<seg id="616"> In addition he promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relationships to the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and to continue the work that the previous presiding Ivan Hasek began otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As a chairperson I would like to dedicate myself to the soccer as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> Begun by the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, about the national selection, the professional soccer, up to the achievement soccer for the youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;In this way I do not want to say that I want to make everything alone&quot;, said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and would like to distribute the competences so therefore that every member dedicates himself to a certain field in the executive committee.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will distribute hard tasks so that the soccer gets on with mile steps in every segment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> About that many would not be just delighted, because they, to criticize only instead of the work other, even really to work in a hard way now would have to begin&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement took into consideration not to run at all more. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;From me it is known that I work on the day 20 hours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I must know that it does sense and that people that do not fling me sticks incessantly between the legs and question every step that I do support me&quot;, he said as a declaration why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people said, however, to me that I must not give up because also others would do it otherwise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;That is confidence which one must not verspielen&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Supposedly being allowed to continue the work which he began under Hasek also motivates him. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;In two years we overcame a big piece work and I do simply not want to throw that away now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> Processes were started that do presumably not become noticeable before in a few years and see I would become only reluctant &quot;that they&quot; meant &quot;somebody stopp&quot;, it and express his objections with that, that for the case, that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen, the situation into the times in front of Hasek could return. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in systematic procedure and that is something which does not bring Mirek Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Particularly people who would make the soccer like this that it was only still there for chosen ones support it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> One can reproach me for presumably some, however not, that I would be biased.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I make an effort for being objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want soccer for all, because all are fine then and not only the Auserwählten&quot;, noticed Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It contradicts also the claim, he is only a chairperson of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even if some people claim the opposite, I really plan to do the best possible thing for old mares.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example it is time to consider whether one should not subdivide the league that winners climbed up in each case then into the first league into a Czech and a mährischen part.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Then it could not happen, that only three mährische clubs play today what especially for the young players a problem is in old mares in the league&quot;, Rajchl means. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because also the head of the Pilsner club Tomás Paclík followed the fight for the function of the chairperson now, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that it is chosen. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I verspüre a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me as their deputy chairperson and recognizes me now that clear successes stand behind me&quot;, Rajchl mentioned, that also the saving of zig millions of crowns for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success looks. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand he blames himself partially for the association not pulling at a single rope. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he is saying from Pelta &quot;it is from the beginning disqualified to help to the Czech soccer to new confidence&quot;, it holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate that really has to offer something to the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can question, that it achieved distinguished work in Pilsen only in a year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If it &quot;should&quot; be chosen, then he would carry on presumably the things, the Ivan Hasek introduced and it would not change also the staff occupation in the commissions fundamentally obviously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> It would surely not &quot;want&quot; to bend&quot; the things&quot; &quot;for his advantages&quot;, Rajchl judges his rival. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Europe&apos;s most beautiful pools </seg>
<seg id="648"> Jump into the blue one </seg>
<seg id="649"> Of Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Paddling pools in UFO-optics, splendor pools in Budapest: His blue miracle can experience who travels through Europe - and rest after a city tour or an excursion the tired legs in mineral baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where Wellness is most beautiful in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When iris Meder in the last ones went one years on research journey, one was not allowed to be missing in their baggage: their swimsuit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Backwards on the water lying, she looked highly into domes formed artistically, it swam towards marble cherubs, that waited for them at the edge of the pool, and that was astonished above meticulously restored youth swimming-halls. </seg>
<seg id="654"> She liked a bath, it matched flugs into their notebook - along with details worth knowing about the design and history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Architecture historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and she imagines now in their just appeared book &quot;Bathing-joys&quot;: Nation swimming-halls in Munich, historical bathing-palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;Hardcore concrete constructions in the Taunus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Through 13 countries it led their &quot;journey into Central Europe&quot; to the most extraordinary baths&quot;: Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungarians, Romania, poles - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The 46-year old German is a true bathing-culture enthusiast. </seg>
<seg id="658"> With sport she does not have much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water that is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Annoyed only, that swimming-fans must come with blue tiles and chlorine stink to terms, breathe in the beguiling fragrance of spruce forests during jogger or can listen to cheerful bird chirp in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I wondered one day why swimming pools must be actually always so ugly&quot;, says the Meder living in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;Therefore I started collecting beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> Water surface doubles architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> Ripples in the diving pool and ethereal sauna-oils - the Wellnessfaktor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are operated, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builders have given themselves to effort, swimming-halls can be one truer eye feast: &quot;Instead of a floor one has a water surface in baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;It is on the one hand transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building, however.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colored tiles, springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The compact picture book &quot;Bathing-joys&quot; provides things worth knowing on 190 pages about the architecture and cult prehistory of historical Wellness oases - particularly fancy for a jump into the blue one does, however. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The pool-collector Meder discovered remarkable copies at their investigations in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Next to splendid spas as the 100 years old Széchenyi-bath in Budapest she found some nitrate-containing waters in an earthy karst cave (Cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a hot spring whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> On the other hand offer spectacular prospects many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one is having the whole city in mind from the inhabitant of Zurich Dachbad, one can look into St. Anton in the exterior pool of a bath on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the driving on the ski-runway. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Badegäste expects the maybe most extraordinary pool-design in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO landed just in the alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> From three to above open shells it steams in the winter while the mountains of the Ötztals into the sky are jutting out in the background. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> Not in every swimming pool the odor increased to the pool-collector Meder from chlorine into the nose. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many hot springs smell of sulphur, in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of fuel oil which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The odor comes of the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen welfare water that is almost black and that mud sticks to one to the skin as soon as one makes glide into the basin - a Wellness experience of the special kind. </seg>
<seg id="677"> At a place Iris Meder was also disappointed on their search for beautiful bathing-places, however: When she wanted to go to the free and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a terrain shut off. </seg>
<seg id="678"> That 1902 designed by the architect Dusan Jurkovic meanwhile Bad was locked. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Meder flung a look through the weather-beaten windows of the red-white-yellow Jugendstil-building, she saw how weed proliferated between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> On the other hand one counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: to the palace Thermal in bath wild bath. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This bath already behind themselves has three construction phases; one can discover not only neo-Romance elements which come from times of his establishment in the year 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the alhambra-style which was added around 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since the careful modernization 1995 is the palaces&apos; Thermal the favorite bath of the pool expert iris Meder - and that not only, because it comes from the Black Forest initially. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It is already an achievement to melt so different architectural styles to a so fabulous unit together&quot;, says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> Apparently only still near such a palace the dive is minor matter in the thermal pool. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agrar-speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> Deutsche Bank makes illuminate raw material business </seg>
<seg id="687"> Of Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with Agrarrohstoffen? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to MIRROR-ONLINE-information Josef Ackermann charged a team to examine the consequences of the speculation for the paupers of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January the company group leader wants to draw consequences then. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the federal citizens the thing is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not think according to a study acceptable that banks speculate in Agrar raw materials as wheat or corn. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of the interviewees even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> That is the result of a Forsa-inquiry on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report, that Foodwatch in the middle of October presented. </seg>
<seg id="696"> In that the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets push up the prices at the global raw material stock exchanges - and bear the banks therefore a complicity at the worldwide hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the Verbraucherschützer turns actually against German-bank-leader Josef Ackermann even if big banks act as Goldman Sachs or similar to Morgan Stanley. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Initial were commemorated raw material bets for that to protect traders against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> However in the meantime most experts are agreed that the long spinners were uncoupled from offer and demand - and at the expense of the Poorest Profits do. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Differently than the US competitors husbandman reacted to the criticism: He promised, to check the reproaches and said, &quot;to risk the good call of the Deutsche Bank&quot;, no business is it &quot;evaluate. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information of MIRROR ONLINE an International Team checks currently the reproaches from the Foodwatch-report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Until end of the year the examination is supposed to be finished, then the results are presented to the executive board of the Deutsche Bank - along with recommendation, as that is supposed to be dealt with. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January the top of the bank wants to inform then which consequences it draws. </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the end a reduction of the raw material business could stand, or even the complete turning away. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Husbandman tinkers with his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch-leader Thilo Bode welcomed the information, at the same time his criticism strengthened, however, at the finance branch: &quot;The betting on increasing prices of food shows especially drastically how banks damage the common weal today inconsiderately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Husbandman stands as an uppermost bank lobbyist now especially in the duty. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank must delete all installations with which money is used for bets onto food prices&quot; from their port folio, said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;Regardless, whether it goes Mr husbandman around people suffering from hunger or around the call of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight of husbandman comes at first sight surprisingly, clear is, however, that the company group leader would like to give few months in front of his departure from the office a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the executive board leader will not change differently than plannedly into the supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a turning away of the controversial Agrar-speculation it could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And around possible losses he hardly needs to cut himself - in this way finally his successor would have to do. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every Second would give up raw material installations </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch makes an effort for holding the pressure on the manager highly. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Up to now already more than 30,000 internet users participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday Bode published the inquiry, for which the institute Forsa at the 7th has questioned and 8th November 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just hold eleven percent once it accordingly for legitimate, that the Deutsche Bank offers installations with which prices are bet on for food. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would draw also personal consequences if they find out that their bank participates in such businesses: Every Second would give up according to the inquiry all installations with which money flows into the raw material speculation. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 percent would warn to acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think about that to cancel their account and to change to another institute. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21st house in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The pavilion gotten changed </seg>
<seg id="723"> Of Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architecture history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian international exhibition pavilion of Brussels 1958 achieved prices, became the museum in Vienna, stand leer and degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is reopened as an exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If by modern Nachkriegsarchitektur is enthused, of clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new materials that are typical for the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is for the Brüssler international exhibition 1958 an apt and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers pavilion got then the gravel Prix d&apos;Architecture light for his and floating working steel glass construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is regarded until today as a milestone of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> It made the architect so known that that one built Pavillon also during the next international exhibition of Austria. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like secondary construction in Munich it became 1973 finally internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His as a temporary exhibition construction one had set up planned pavilion to the international exhibition in the Swiss garden near the Viennese south railway station, rebuilt and opened up in 1962 in that a museum of the 20th century - it was mentioned the &quot;20th house&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Neither the building was not suitable, however, spatial and technical as a museum - no walls for the hanging of the art, no good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> In spite of that it was used for so long until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building stand leer and came down more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz rebuilt the pavilion, he calls now &quot;21st house&quot; and is useful in future as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening opens the museum there to Belvedere, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became new directress of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, put through the new start. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, promovierte art historian with considerable career and other in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later with Sotheby&apos;s, that Guggenheim Museum and as a foundation directress of the museum the modern one Salzburg, put through the reconstruction emphatically with politicians and monument conservationists, she got public means and private sponsor money and defined the use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for present art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a book store, and an office building had to be built for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Severe supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the realization Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only, because it Joseph Olbrichs Secession alters into Vienna sensitively and enlarges and had won the competition, but because he studied near swan cerium at the Technical Vienna University and the pavilion was an &quot;enormously important place&quot; at which he had had a look at the exhibitions &quot;almost every weekend&quot; for it. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the aurochs-draft, and he knew the problems of the building which lost generosity and lightness already during his moving to Vienna and his Umnutzung. </seg>
<seg id="744"> During the present reconstruction there were far greater problems: The building was &quot;an energy centrifuging&quot;, says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, used glass-fabric supported insulation glass and replaced the glass roof through special triplex. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Cold bridge steel bases were supported or replaced, and asbestos-filled covers were renovated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements brought place for the new use, a sunk light ditch between house and street guarantees for the illumination, a bridge leads to the entry - almost a new building, however still the easy tail pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original external doors stayed, the house is deleted in the old reddish brown rust protection tint. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema hall is even still very just the same how it was formerly. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And that all under severe supervision of the monument authority and with small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often a material which is good and which is cheap and also the monument protection office liked&quot; had to be found&quot;, Krischanitz says and refers to a ruppigen ground in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> In spite of all compulsions, problems and reconstructions the building stayed flexibly and slightly. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It was difficult with the pavilion &quot;that came along from Brussels&quot;, said Krischanitz recently, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture &quot;always stands &quot;at the wrong place&quot; and wants to raise a correct consciousness in spite of that. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the 21st house is, however, not at the wrong place, because a city-structural stroke of luck kicked in: Around the Swiss garden around just the completely again planned &quot;central station accommodation&quot;, with office and living houses, arises. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And maybe still another stroke of luck will set in: The 21st house could get strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliners Temporary Arts Center, and as one hears, she negotiates already with the city around a nachbarschaftlichen location in the Swiss garden. </seg>

<seg id="764"> A doubling of the internal and external employees is planned among other things for the snow removal on railway systems and platforms on 16,000 persons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> It is an objective to release platforms from four to five hours up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the flanks necessary for operation from snow and ice. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Rail-leader Rüdiger Grube had warned against two months after a top meeting with government and industry before train failure rates and delays also in this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> In the last winter the railways had considerable problems in the passenger traffic since she lacks reserves among other things with difficult weather conditions. </seg>

<seg id="773"> As if the problems were not already enough at home for the Deutsche Bank, gets to the branch reams now also still his past in the USA one: The Frankfurter institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison in order to settle quarrels because of the bankruptcy of five big co-operative banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It is a question of the sale from mortgage papers. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The financial market adjuster NCUA reproaches a whole row at big banks to have induced the co-operative banks with wrong promises to the purchase of the finance products; they would have ran through the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such papers lost during the financial crisis value strongly and carried away the banks into the depth. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are satisfied, that we could solve the topic without the parties having to move in court&quot; a German bank speaker said in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank did not grant any fault with the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> That is valid also for the Citigroup who committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The NCUA-chairperson Debbie Matz welcomed the obligingness of the two money houses. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit union administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US co-operative banks and clicks with bankruptcies in order to protect the customer deposits. </seg>

<seg id="789"> Even if the events date back already some years, so waves the banks currently in the USA a sharp wind towards. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and inspectorates tired innumerable complaints in order to receive reparation or to avenge misdemeanors. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) activated the biggest complaint wave. </seg>
<seg id="792"> She reproaches 18 international big banks to have cheated the two state US-Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with mortgage businesses in the volume of about 200 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Also the Deutsche Bank must be confronted with a complaint of the FHFA, here it is a question of several businesses to the value of in total 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>

<seg id="802"> An investment of Warren Buffett is regarded as an accolade in the financial world. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Accordingly the IBM IT-Urgestein may mention himself &quot;Sir IBM&quot; now. </seg>

<seg id="809"> IBM comes down since geraumer time the lucrative IT service&apos;s as the company of computer centers. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The more than 100 years old computer engineer offers also software and consultation as well as efficient company computers. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett had avoided technology companies until dato rather. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He says he invests only in enterprises whose business he also understands. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Instead of this Buffett grasped for instance at a freight railroad, with a lubricant-manufacturer or machine builder. </seg>
<seg id="814"> His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has also parts of a whole series of big concerns as Coca-Colas or the Munich Re next to about 80 own subsidiary companies, the former inhabitants&apos; of Munich Rueck. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The 81-year long one had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway into the 1960er-Jahren and built it up with clever investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Nevertheless his life-style is modest. </seg>
<seg id="817"> He is therefore for innumerable investors in all world a cult figure. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost untrüglicher sense for the money-earning was the nickname &quot;Oracle&quot; to him worth &quot;from Omaha&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After Bekannt are climbed the Buffett investment&apos;s the IBM stock vorbörslich about a percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM also is named, is at the stock exchange more than in total 220 billion dollars worth and numbers in this way together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Near Microsoft, so Buffett said, he does not want to get in, however. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Founder Bill Gates is a narrow friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is tangible </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the exposure of the &quot;Zwickauer Zelle&quot; Turkish media doubt about the German constitutional state. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper even speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; which now again revives. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight Turkish-stocky ones and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="827"> This information is reacted to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many Deutsch-türken a ghost for a long time in a dead way believed returns in this way: Since the fire assaults in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has not been any comparable violence with right-extremist background anymore against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> That there is foreigner hostility in Germany was never into consideration in spite of that. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The uncovered right-extremist network reveals, however, extent whose dimension for a long time yet is not forseeable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;The bloody ideology revives again?&quot; titelte the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; on the other hand it stresses that a V man of the intelligence service is supposed to have been to one of the culprits, and it is proved worriedly that also German authorities into the right-radical swamp could be complex. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Prudently the Turkish Germany Municipality reacted: It reminded at the weekend with a reminder guard before the from Brandenburg gate onto the victims of racist power. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks before the Turkish municipality had thought in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruiting-agreement. </seg>
<seg id="835"> In cheerful colors was the With each other produced - as a history of the success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> As a slap the reporting of some Turkish media works there: &quot;Germany&apos;s present to the Fiftieth&quot; says the heading of an article in the Turkish internet platform &quot;Oat X&quot; that reports the backgrounds of the murder series. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the Germany edition of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; can not be taken it, to draw this intellectual connection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It starts stinking&quot;, the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci is called. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It stresses in that that people were murdered, would have paid the taxes and would have achieved an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Extremely critically the procedure of the police and their late search success is discussed in German-Turkish internet forums. </seg>
<seg id="841"> The German authorities did already rather not remember why to search for suspects in right-extremist circles the authors are surprised. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Many show themselves at least rhetorically readily for drastic means: If people &quot;keep on working sloppily here, nothing else remains for the migrants so than the self-defense and the armament&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;That will be presumably the best selfprotection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;From the kindness of the clarification and appropriateness of the penalization of the entire network the internal peace hangs very strongly in Germany off&quot;, writes &quot;Selen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> The assaults of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties clarified what means it if the internal peace is in danger in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event showed the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat more clearly and the German, that distrust and distance can lead to right power. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The assaults sharpened, however, the Wir feeling&apos;s on Turkish page. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Do not repeat the errors of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press particularly the failure of the German politics was criticized then after the assaults: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire assault of Solingen he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish President of the State, made on the grief celebration in Cologne, however, from his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel represent - Kinkel counted then in his speech as the local Turks achieved many deliveries. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Completely so, as if the value of a human being is charged to the height of his tax deliveries. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The present reporting of the Turkish media shows again once how the distrust of many German Turks is deeply into the local rule of law since then. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Next to the efforts of an extensive clarification and re-evaluation of the right-extreme terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The scandal bank of the Zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS went in the financial crisis almost bankruptly and slides since then into the next one from a crisis. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now a German is supposed to do. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So Axel Weber had surely not thought it. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure of the top of the Federal Reserve it had become known in July that he would enter upon an almost just as spectacular new job in 2013: Board of directors president of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was pleased in public, Switzerland praised whether their beauty and the UBS whether their again gained solidness and made friendly remarks fall about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS created the Turnaround&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> However already in September it realized that everything would come very differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of the UBS in London had avoided all standby systems of the bank and about 1.7 billion euros verzockt. </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS executive board leader Oswald Grübel, a banker not praised only in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The board of directors president of the UBS is regarded since then also as hit - and all ask: When does Axel Weber come at last? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already it became known that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it takes over the board of directors chairmanship already in May - not only in the year 2013, as the bank on Tuesday informed. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber that hardens. </seg>
<seg id="871"> He is not a banker, rather economics professor and note banker and a training period would have had certainly necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="872"> With a stroke it takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that just once again proved then that they longest the title &quot;largest scandal bank of Europe&quot; deserves. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the UBS is on the one hand gigantic - until recently she was the tallest property manager of the world - and on the other hand for years slides into the next one from a scandal. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems like this, keeps on being spared the once so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It began in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> To 2007 the UBS had an excellent call. </seg>
<seg id="877"> She had combined the image of the hidden and sound one, but also ausgebufften Schweizer property manager with ambitious objectives: It wanted to become a very great number also in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand so the UBS administered in 2007 more money of wealthy customers with 1.6 trillion dollars than any other bank of the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand it had moved on as an investment bank into the league of the biggest banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> That did impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and later long-standing bank professor told in Zurich Hans Geiger: &quot;I then always posed my students the UBS as patterns of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From present view one asks to oneself: How could I me only so mad&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was mistaken tremendously. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In the year 2007 it became for the first time apparent that something went wrong appropriately in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year executive board leader Peter Wuffli who until then was regarded as a highly-intellectual and just as brilliant banker stepped surprisingly back. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later one foresaw, why it had gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment section of the bank had itself with subprime-papers verzockt and had to refuse an invitation from billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to shoulder that, the UBS canceled a capital increase at the level of of says and write 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For that she found in fact investors, however which one which some would have turned up the nose at until shortly before still: an intransparenten Asiatic state fund from Singapore and an Arabian state fund that it was so hidden that one did not find out even his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> However, that was only the first stroke. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 it came more badly. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to announce new billion losses, board of directors president Marcel Ospel, 2006 still that at the second-best one paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: The UBS stood faced with their misinvestments in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought billions of problematic securities from the UBS for zig, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond issue, over which they could become co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how it is dramatically for a small country if it houses so large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the balance-sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as great as the economic achievement of Switzerland was (see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again we could not save the UBS&quot;, says bank researcher violinist. </seg>
<seg id="898"> To the first disaster the second connected herself. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already few months on that the UBS capitulated in the tax quarrel with America and declared itself readily to hand over the data of wealthy customers which had evaded taxes possibly with the aid of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Furthermore she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these businesses along with punishment impact. </seg>
<seg id="901"> In this way the UBS admitted to have helped with the tax evasion freely more or less. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Simultaneously she lost something, that always had been their capital in the competition around rich customers: the nimbus of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> According to the scandal the Swiss banker&apos;s discretion was not the same one anymore. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It the resignation followed from executive board leader and board of directors president. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the bank had lost within less months their plausibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking through the blemish speculations and in the property administration through the help for the tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just than it became again a little quieter, just than one thought there this unblissful trader history follows now the UBS will manage it already again: A single trader verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notices that something goes wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it becomes apparent: It does not work with the risk management in the investment banking obviously still. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli one had had to state that the risk control changed into little&quot;, says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institution of the Zurich university. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also the finance executive board of a large Deutsche Bank is sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is that she does not have the risk control under control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> Nevertheless in this case it had been the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers a long time ago had lined up exactly to become guardian of the big properties of the world: no far too great risks, for that security for the money - the world liked to collapse also beyond the alp republic once. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The safes of the Swiss banks had become the symbol for unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still matches the cliche of the high-quality Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classical. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank wears their head office the inhabitant of Zurich railway station trasses&apos; that leads from the central station directly to the Zurich lake that is framed from the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are splendid, the loading rents belong to the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> One finds jewelers as Tiffany&apos;s here between Swiss tradition businesses as the Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries the Swiss banks are residing here: of the National Bank about the palace the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> One enters the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are marble-lined, before that thick leather armchairs stand, next to the bank logo a big sign to the &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer searches here: Security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, replaced this idea of the Swiss bank sometime, however - or betray how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His names he would not like to read more gladly in the newspaper finally it, as all Swiss bankers, does businesses also with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS became much too large, he thinks - particularly in the investment banking, where furthermore the Anglo-Saxons would have expanded. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss would not have to say anything more there. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And when nevertheless, they adapted themselves to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons for a long time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> The Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS was it actual to her first high profits gave and then the collapse: No European finance institute lost as much money in the subprime-jungle as the Swiss big bank did. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15th October 2008 the disaster became visible. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million country concluded the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The UBS-crash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros in order to save the big bank standing before the bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could it result in that? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem like this particularly in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two of the three Swiss big banks joined to a tremendous company group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank arose that was too big already during the fusion for the small Switzerland - and always further increased. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped with that that the two different precursor-banks of the UBS complemented themselves: a rich, however, overslept bank with the emphasis property administration into Zurich and a poorer, however, already more strongly internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers came favorably onto a lot of money with which they could turn a gigantic wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are combined to the UBS with this rise: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 company group leader the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairperson of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team&quot;, says bank researcher Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest that knows about models and statistics a lot, and Ospel, the stomach human being that plowed from the bank lesson up to very above.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel relied to the end on Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli at the end probably made a decisive error: &quot;He thought his models are the reality&quot;, says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;That is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Clear is: High spirits came before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of the UBS remember clearly the manager-meetings on which company group leader Wuffli distributed the same motto again and again: Pushing Goldman Sachs from the throne. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She led the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks of that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> There the UBS wanted, very up. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps were already successful to her. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign exchange business and in the share trading it played very above. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Management consultants that were charged emphasized, however, a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banker language &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there is a tremendous distance to the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has gaps with American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> In order to fill this gap, UBS went into an adventure which cost it to almost the existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungrily for growth, both the bank itself and a Hedgefonds founded before it invested in American subprime-installations. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It developed into a tremendous machine that packed securities onto American mortgage credits and passed them on - in this case, however, also even risks kept. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also still, than other banks searched the exit for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Still in the summer 2007, when the American property market in flames stood, the UBS bought there&quot;, says Bankenexperte to violinist. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So large the euphoria, so deeply the case. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after the other one had to go than the attempts to tidy up in a more difficult way turned out than thoughtly. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts at the UBS became the ejection seat and are until today wobbly. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for a bank which lost all obvious business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bank researcher violinist has already an idea: End with the investment banking, concentration on the property administration, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Very so far the bank does not want to go indeed (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is now already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> On the coming Thursday the new bank leader Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present his future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 years old Italo-Swiss was thought actually only as interim solution when the bank separated from predecessor Grübel surprisingly. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime it continued: It is supposed to lead the businesses of the UBS permanently, Bank divided the inhabitants of Zurich on Tuesday with. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to drive back the investment bank onto the state in the middle of the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It deletes 3500 places. </seg>
<seg id="971"> That will not suffice, however. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what does she want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> Those ones are the questions which Axel Weber surely now already asks to himself. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In public he only says up to now, it searches an apartment first with his wife once in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stock exchange </seg>
<seg id="979"> The threatening recession in Europe took the courage from the US investors for the week prelude. </seg>
<seg id="980"> The government changes in Athens and Rome remained without fighting power. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The curbed industry production on the continent nipped the hopes for a stabilization of the fault crisis in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The general relief about the government changes in Rome and Athens could not continue. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The euro fell opposite the dollar. </seg>
<seg id="984"> The Italian and Greek glass still has in the last week as half fully been valid, not than half empty - now again the problems were pushed, however, into the foreground, Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott said marks. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Particularly finance values stood on the sale notes. </seg>
<seg id="986"> The Dow Jones index of the default values was quoted around 0.6 percent to the commercial end with a minus with 12,078 points. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In the commercial course the market barometer shuttled between 12,027 and 12,170 points. </seg>
<seg id="988"> The wide understood S&amp;P-500-Index closed with 1251 points, a minus of a percent. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The index of the technology stock exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went with 2657 points from the trade. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In Frankfurt the Dax with a minus said goodbye from 1.2 percent at 5985 counters. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The industry in the 17 euro-countries reduced their production clearly and prepares itself for the end of the upswing. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The enterprises produced in September two percent less here than in the Vormonat as the statistics office informed of euro action. </seg>
<seg id="993"> That made the US investors sceptical: &quot;We are not an island, but dependent&quot;, Steve Goldman of Goldman Management said. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe will not be able to free so quickly from a recession, furthermore there are further signs of the weakness near the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether it is strong enough to Europe to do everything for an end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC-interview. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore it is too early from his view to invest in European state loans or banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead of this Buffett threw in decades old principle above the heaps and got into the US technology branch. </seg>
<seg id="998"> His investment above more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the tradition company group and let it against the trend in the commercial course at first just one percent be quoted more highly. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The paper closed almost as before at 187.35 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Buffett paid according to own information 170 dollars per piece on the average and holds now 5.5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent. </seg>

<seg id="1003"> The house silvers almost the entire rest of his parts of that one to China Construction Bank and paints 6.6 billion dollars for that. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> The institute wants to pad particularly his capital rate with the net-profit from the business and follow harder regulation handicaps in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The airplane farmer Boeing hotted up the pace and located the losses with that in the Dow. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> The stock won 1.5 percent after the company group had collected the greatest task of his history. </seg>

<seg id="1009"> At the New York Stock Exchange about 710 million stocks changed the owner. </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Intelligent crows spread in cities from </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places rooks are regarded as &quot;problem birds&quot;: However, from the cities the highly-intelligent animals can not be marketed for a long time anymore, say experts. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Ones like it, the others would like to rid themselves of it very quickly: Crows are belonging for centuries to the townscape, however, in many communes resident complaints accumulate about dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> In this case a remedy for the &quot;problem birds&quot; is not up to now in view. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Rooks are not to be gotten from the cities more out, said experts with the first crow symposium in the East Frisian one. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> There experts discussed from the entire federal territory about possible ways out. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> You search alternatives in the cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Conservationists put down in this case the problems also to the rural exodus of the especially protected rooks in cities: The chemistry use in the agriculture destroys the traditional living spaces increasingly. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> The hunt, increasing development and the felling of typical breeding trees did the life to the birds heavily. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows stand under nature conservation. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are big colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> There a controversial project for the massive killing had provided in 2005 negative-headlines from crows in the rural district. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics had referred to the call tracing of the animals in bird trap and the killing with sticks as especially brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;The normal eviction, the Vergrämen, does not bring anything&quot;, the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found from Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Splashing nests with water or felling trees has often unwanted consequences, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals avoid, big colonies split up and they distribute themselves at other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Vergrämung is conceivable only as an exception at hospitals, homes for the elderly or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We must live with them, we do not get it more away.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Without the surrounding area the problem can not be solved in the cities, mayor Wolfgang Kellner thought from Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> A combination of Vergrämen of the animals is conceivable from sensitive living-fields and attracting-offers in order to settle it again at other places. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> On the other hand &quot;Info board instead of chain saws&quot; recruited the psychologist and ethnologist of Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different contact with the animals: &quot;Finally we can stand a pimple in the face best self-confidently.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jürgens had established in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger crow teaching-path at which signs inform of the life of the highly-intelligent rooks. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Meanwhile the project is already accepted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Also for the criticism at the noise of the birds had Jürgens an own opinion: &quot;There every amount is communication, those ones have to say a lot to themselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and skilfulness of the animals are legendary: Rooks do not use only aids in order to come onto a delicacy, but they even manufacture their tool as an aid themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Behaviorists of the Cambridge university tested recently at four rooks, as far the intelligence of the birds suffices. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In an experiment the birds learned quickly that they must bring a scaffold to the collapse with stones in order to reach so a moth larve. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without a lot of training they recognized purposefully which size and form a stone must have in order to make the platform collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second attempt the clever crows had to solve a trickier problem then. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a cylinder in a normal way made the researchers had seated a small Eimerchen with a moth larve. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> With the beak the birds could not reach their booty. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers had put down wire pieces for them. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals shaped a hook with whose help they caught the Eimerchen then at the grip from the small tube from that. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four rooks succeeded in this even immediately. </seg>

And these central figures function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you are lost in the fog of the war and robbed of your illusions to Männer and women as Englunds. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> A Swedish historian and journalist is Peter Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is furthermore the new constant secretary of the Swedish academy which determines the Nobel prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He wrote an unusual book which he does not describe incorrectly as &quot;a work of the anti-history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains only few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and outfit. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is little a book about that something passed, he declares, but rather a book above how it was. It deals with &quot;Feelings, impressions, experiences and atmospheres&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;Beauty and frights&quot; almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both pages of the war together, of school girls and botanists up to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance driver and office workers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people become hero. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some become prisoner of war, lose limbs, become mad or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Each of these lives flares up as the Votivkerzen in a church, some join while others would be ceasing. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Englunds book deviates from the usual history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It in addition corrects the idea the First World War was only the disastrous war of position at the west front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;Beauty and startling&quot; roam with expert look over other theaters of war: the alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, east Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Hives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is almost from the beginning a traveling book. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war floods the life of these people as a natural catastrophe, as a hurricane Katrina which smells of Kordit. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> You introduce yourself, you are a woman that is at home with their children, and hears cannon fires in the distance. Stay or do you take the flight? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who comes actually? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly somebody understands what happens or why actually this war is led. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Missing facts&quot;, so Englund finds, &quot;were revamped with suppositions, assumptions, hopes, fears, ideas fix, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;Beauty and startling&quot; follow single persons as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse, in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Your histories were already mainly taken memories to letters from published material and other. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Your life reports can frightening or be overcoming, nevertheless they are extremely alive in Englunds of the crowd of small moments losing in details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them deal with lack and Itself make-shift arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the history of a German school girl it tells: &quot;Substitute, everywhere substitute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper associations, wood buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He tells more of the replacement chimneys in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes &quot;Meat, that was done from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and at last with a wrong bone of wood was served), tobacco that was made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were soled with wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There were &quot;837 registered food substitutes which were allowed in the production from sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes as he notes down. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some histories deal with honor and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own urge for the wildness and says about the war: &quot;One feels that that is for all that what was rather planned for men than to be in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the best seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand and to do as if such a facade means civilization and as if there were not any barbarism behind the own starched and shod shirtfront.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> In reverse a British soldier recognizes that he will presumably die and not take memo from anybody from that or see to that. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If one refrains from the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that this happens before a public&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead of this it is as terrible as &quot;a condemned man who was hanged in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations act of the old Europe which falls from each other, and about new kinds of the terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict became an economical contest increasingly&quot;, writes Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He catches the arrival of that, what it calls &quot;a new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century&apos;s&quot;: &quot;the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit that slaughters while he is being behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Englund discusses the soldiers that attempted actively to infect oneself with a venereal disease with a prostitute in order to escape the front service. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The grotesque expression of that can be discovered on the market with gonococcus pus, because soldiers bought and smeared onto their genitals, in the hope to come so into the hospital&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those that had really despaired abraded it into the eyes, which led to that, that they were the rest of their life blind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves poetry becomes supple to Englunds and nevertheless unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes he catches the kind and way in which the war &quot;in unique way provoked uncontrollable strengths: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The people begin themselves to ask why their leaders bring it to the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War were mostly rather falsified as Paul Fussells &quot;Great War and Rot Memory&quot; or novels as Erich Maria Remarques &quot;In the west nothing new&quot; as extensive history books. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Englunds band joins an unconventional fame hall. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has the most disastrous end from which I ever read in a thing book. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do not give it anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> However it is, as he would have weggeschnappt us this page with the central figures with his book before the nose and lit it with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> According to an early slip a minutiös planned infringement </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of Polizeibeamte were shared at that, some of them bore use helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> One had decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time people are hardly in the Zucotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept a secret and only few hochrangige officials were informed. All others believed at the beginning to participate in a practice. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Chief constable Raymond W. Kelly was right among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation of full challenges put. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> The incidents of the last weeks as the start of pepper spray against protesters what offends against the rules of the department and provided the squatters with an enormous increase at public sympathies were not allowed to be repeated anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And so the police operation for the removing of the protesters was carried out from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of the planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Officials had prepared these when they observed how occupations were handled in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A disaster practice had occurred with a look on Zuccotti on Randalls Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Appoints intensified the so-called chaos training - measures for the terrorism abatement which also the fast transfer of a great number numbers among from police officers - around themselves on Lower Manhattan concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training unit found Monday night on the Manhattan-page of the East River instead of. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The command to move in in the park came &quot;in a last minute way&quot;, said somebody, that order with the is trusted, which Deklarierung spoke as &quot;a practice&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few policemen, that my knowledge&apos;s were included, did not know that it was&quot; a question &quot;of the Zuccotti Park&quot;, somebody that would like to remain anonymous said. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones that knew that it was a question of the Zuccotti Park were the hochrangigen officials of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> A reason for the secrecy was a lesson which the city had learned. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14th October officials wanted to evacuate the park, withdrew then, however, when hundreds of protesters came together after these of these plans had found out. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Officials of different police units were participated in the operation of the Tuesday, among other things also task forces from the whole city - groups of one hundred of mobile officials that usually are employed in highly criminal neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said, that in the course of the day many persons in the park one- and go out, almost as commuters, so that 1 clock is a good time in the night in order to go in. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was adequate to do this if the least number of persons stays in the park&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood before the departure at the pike slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan bridge ready. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lamps and the first of all recorded news that droned from the loudspeakers splint many protesters intimidate. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> When the public officials penetrated the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply rafften zusammen their things and left the place. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> The police said that until 1:45 o&apos;clock no tents would be touched in order to give to the protesters time to manage their property together. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of officials were seen as they collected themselves in the surroundings in order to intervene, if arrests should become necessary in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters were forced to leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, speaker of the chief constable, said, this is too of this happen own security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists say that one wanted to keep it from observing the police operations in the park. And they said the contact of the officials was very rough. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that TV cars could have made photos in the Church Street at the west side of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> As themselves the police in the direction of waistcoats through the large jumble at personal things of the protesters, among other things Koffer, Kunstrasen and Tüten with Kleider, moved, employees of the town cleaning that canceled followed it which had been let back. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to go were dragged towards outside. Pictures of that appeared already short time later in the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A macronucleus of protesters got position near the kitchen field of the warehouse in the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some established barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Approximately 10 persons in the epicenter of the warehouse tied themselves together at their arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two persons chained themselves even to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Officials of the disaster protection were called in order to cut it loosely. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out until approx. 3:30 o&apos;clock in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The clearing was according to statements of the police finished after 75 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that 142 persons were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> It resulted in most arrests how he said due to &quot;improper behavior and resistance to an arrest&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, departmental head of the detectives, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> In spite of his presence Mr Kelly &quot;did not lead the operation&quot; as Mr Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> For the case, that they should grasp, a second group waited to the eastern page of the Broadway from officials, between Liberty and Cedar Street. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the pins Street, a block further southern, barricades were constructed. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the vicinity always further around around the Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At a place it was observed how several officials, many of them with protection signs, floated outside according to persons. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There were approximately 28 persons in the northern vicinity. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the gewalttätigsten actions of the night occurred in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> By 5 o&apos;clock a protester jumped south of the pins Street onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators skipped the air the tire&apos;s of a police bus. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At a place the amount flung a piece of plywood. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end an official and a protester came into the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Trade union of the attendants will submit complaint against the city because of dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The trade union, the hundreds of school attendants, that last month their job have lost, represents, intends to sue the city on Wednesday since the dismissals are not necessary and discriminating due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The complaint is probably the last possibility, that of the trade union, district council 37, in their efforts, to cancel the dismissals, still openly stands. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Have described six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other employees that belonged to the worst paid employees of the city and had lost their work on the 7th October in a move with whom the budget gap should be filled the union leader than political revenge for one having refused the access to a health ground that the teams maintained in the last year of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Was rejected this accusation categorically from the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> On a hearing of the town council it said to Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the last month the dismissals were part of the budget that one said goodbye in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the town council fired back and declared him that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school help would be released. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the town council 37 said, they would have and they warned the education ministry against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submitting of the complaint is announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The complaint becomes Mr. Present Walcott and the education ministry of the city as defendants and count eight released workers as a complainant that all are colored or Latin-American women as most of the helpers that lost their work. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said, there would not be the complaint for the city and thus their single claims can not be commented to. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a complaint draft which there is for the New York Times the trade union concentrated on the number of the dismissals at the schools in the pauper quarters of the city in order to support a complaint because of different treatment. She says that poor schools would have lost more helpers since they are chronically unterfinanziert. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> She explains, that, during it no dismissals on states Iceland and only few dismissals in the schools the upper East Side or TriBeCa was, have lost 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and were released 46 helpers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers that were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: &quot;This is not a neighborhood of well-to-do parents who can organize donations in order to absorb budget shortenings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was shortened this year around 3.26 percent. In addition money disappeared when the city changed their calculation method for the extrafinancing for every pauper school registration. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The trade union in addition laments that the conductors of the High Schools were guided through the language in a Memo who approved the dismissal of the care coordinators into the insane. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The Memo also used the English word &quot;excess&quot; in order to describe the action when &quot;excess&quot; (German: hand over) in the USA usually the change of a teacher of the payroll of a school into a pool of available workers describes, that are paid from the central department. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not &quot;handed over&quot;, says the complaint draft. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission ends, congress ready, with regard to Libya communicate </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally it looks as if republicans and democrats were already in Washington to agree upon Libya with regard to the revolts. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All which was necessary for that was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of the American interference. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday the committee decides for international relationships of the senate on a resolution which subordinates to the chairperson John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut, near which one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who began with the reconstruction of their country&quot;, said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts through two parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language likes to ring innocently, however, up to now nothing was simple in the Libya-debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer legislator of both parties and the White House argued about the word choice of a series of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya-mission of the NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of military strengths of the USA in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law was rejected in the senate by a wide fringe group of both parties and it did not result in any vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> However, on the same day this law failed in the senate. In addition the chamber outvoted a decision for the shortening of the money for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Through that the US mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress, that indeed angry enough was to criticize Obamas, however, approach within the framework of the mission not furious enough, in order finally to pull him away the ground among the feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then the indecision of the congress of the events was overtaken. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebel and Gaddafi was killed on 20th October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO-mission ended officially on 31st October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Maybe now the senate is ready for the action. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the committee for international relationships &quot;congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary persistence in their selfliberation&quot; and praises the men and women of the US American military and their coalition partners that support the military operations to the protection of the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and their professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution in addition confirms &quot;the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable crossing of Libya for the democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measures will receive the full support through the committee for foreign relationships or will they divide up the legislators as it did the law of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The last composure bumps onto the resistance of the senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars speaker said on Monday that he did not see the final composure of the new law up to now yet. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to Kapitol it suits at the senate to vote on a constitutional change that requires a harmonious budget this week a top priority in almost every congress legislative period of the republicans and some democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the management of the republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another field to be voted at this time in the senate or congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators attempted up to now unsuccessfully to bring their changes to the vote in spite of their often enough attempting it. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes which were presented to this congress and contain a whole bandwidth of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are double - the same law was presented to both the congress and the senate - others deviate only easily from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> It further dozen gives at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and one only in the senate, that Federal editions would control. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are also identical, but they give the possibility in this way to boast to their customers - in particular beginner with the republicans that want to polish up their course of life -, that they &quot;wrote&quot; such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The budgetary control law that was passed in August requires, that both senate and congress vote on a change of the budget compensation. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March 58 senators voted for a resolution not binding which supports the idea of such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget some members want to restrict the number of the regulations which members of the congress can present while the republican José E. Serrano (New York) is wanting to cancel the limitation on two terms of office of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) suggested a series of changes that guarantees the right to a good education and health care among other things. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> A change that forbids a marriage among homosexual is just the same as a change that prohibits from the burning of flags, a presentation always turning round again. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators in addition want to facilitate the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the states refuse these. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Travel so eagerly as the members suggest to changes so much more quickly they as in the last years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th congress legislators presented 77 of such changes. in the 110th congress 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The speed fades in comparison with that of the early 1990th years in which members suggested every two years to regularly more than 150 changes so the numbers that the senate library provides. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> However, they were not either much more successful than the present ones were. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change that is to be added - the 27th -, was ratified in 1992, was suggested, however, to the congress in in fact already 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Struck&quot;, &quot;not &quot;conquered&quot;, however&quot;, according to Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination attempt </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after an armed man had fired from next distance during a choice event in Tucson onto them the republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) occurred Monday evening in the national television. She only sang to the Broadway piece &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said, the wish, to recover it is larger than that one to return to the congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> When it occurred together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-news &quot;20/20&quot;, she struggled for words and help needed during the walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The broadcasting showed the hard slow recovery of the damage which the ball caused which divides their skull, drills the left page of their brain and crossed their head from front up to behind. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago it returned surprisingly to the congress, around triumphing their voice to the fault brake give. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In their first TV interview after the assassination attempt in January in the case of which six people were killed and 13 hurt Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and their convalescence as &quot;difficult&quot; described. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked her how she feels, Gifford (41) answered: &quot;Very good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and their husband, the astronaut mark Kelly, part was of one one-hour &quot;20/20&quot;-Specials, that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the married couple: &quot;Gabby: A history above courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special hunts Giffords convalescence since the assassination attempt of the 8th January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos which Kelly had recorded in the first weeks one sees it in the hospital bed, with baldly shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It can lift only one or two fingers if their husband encourages her to that. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later Giffords is in a rotation chair while therapists are showing her how she carries out simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nodding with the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A twitch with that lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, their first words: &quot;What.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After few days Giffords whispers a further word: &quot;Toast&quot;. She would like, that their breakfast is changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos that are played in the ABC show point, that music an important role in Giffords &apos;Convalescence played: One sees&quot; as the congress representative together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and to Tom Pettys &quot;Free Fallin&apos;&quot; sings. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer Giffords who spends two hours with therapy daily said that she can not remember the assassination attempt on the day. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Your husband said that he had read Giffords an article of a daily paper on 12th March about the assassination attempt than it interrupted it and asked for the first time for the six people that had been killed during the assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The probable shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is treated compulsorily medically while he is waiting for his negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died&quot;, told Giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of the convalescence of his wife, so Kelly Sawyer told, it said: &quot;I was struck.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;Therefore, I would say: &quot;Gabby, you were not &quot;conquered&quot;? Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You were only struck. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you stand that and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops rather feel pity as respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street gala dress, the millions of dollar for homeless veterans in New York City collected. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad above helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Onto a keyword there collected a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine around it around. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The amount in black dinner jackets got up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The soldiers were seen as heroes&quot;, said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A rank-high military officer on the gala dress, that among other things of the stick leader and former chairpersons&apos;, admiral Mike Mullen was observed, the role of the troops saw different. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;You were introduced as orphans&quot;, wrote the officer in an E-Mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure, the organizers have it in a well-meant way. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it was not a respect, really not. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The blatant inconsistent impressions illustrate the hard relationship between the military and the mostly distanzierten, sometimes admiring American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has his price, say service members. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public behaves increasingly as if the people would do her sorrow in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We were not by any means victims&quot;, said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, the troops&apos; in Iraq commanded and soon to Afghanistan will go. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;The only way of the support is &quot;however apparent that one is, to press us into the role of unhappy souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The topic is extremely sensitive for military chiefs, that not thankless or want to appear in the quarrel with the public that uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also they recognized that the rage which beat towards returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was by far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a consequence conversations occur about pity in the Quiet and Private one between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons from fights have returned with the Marine, the Colonel warned retiredly mark of Cancian they before people being able to see their service outside of the military world from two different perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would consider it with a feeling of reverence since they had conquered rebels and traveled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would wonder whether a &quot;furious, violent veteran&quot; hides himself &quot;under the surface&quot;, said Cancian who had fought in Iraq and took over a higher state post after his return in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his job hunting, so he said, he sensed that some of the Befrager inquired subtly whether it is in the situation to resist to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington now after his return from the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;If you talk about your service, you must hold the negative impressions on the other hand&quot;, declared Cancian his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The missing lightness of the military is rooted partially in the missing interest of the Americans at the war. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> That services on the battlefield become little experience with the military from a country has and it sees only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, selected only rarely as praise. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We than to appreciate a nation more the way it was still completely usual in the Second World War&quot; did not say &quot;military heroism&quot; lieutenant General David Barno retiredly, the US troops&apos; in Afghanistan commanded. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead of this the praise of the politicians and the public most mainly focuses on the sorrow of a service member. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops find recognition for the number of the attacks that they stood, the number of the friends, who lost it or for the weight of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Military is confronted with the wachsenden pressure for the hard punchthrough at rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> In this week an important hearing decides on whether 28 women and men are accused of nonintervention at a rape in front of the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If it should not result in that, hundreds of complainants stand ready for the next hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Lance corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when it was oppressed at night by a soldier colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and it returned just to their barracks from San Diego of the supper with a friend that bore a 12th pack beer with himself in Miramar to the north when it stumbled on a masculine colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her whether he might accompany it on a drink into their room. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;My alarm bells started&quot; Lyman said. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But Texan wiped their objections aside. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &quot;Ach what, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wanted, I would have listened to my stomach feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Few minutes, after they had gone in Lymans rooms, the man stepped behind them, it pressed down and she violated, she claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18th November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military employees wait anxiously for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint is approved which they raised against the former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, in court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint claims, that to Gates and Rumsfeld did not rake against the widespread rape within the military and under injury of the constitutional ones the soldiers&apos; have gone on. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C. submitted, the complaint grasped at the beginning of 17 complainants that, however, went up onto 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men that say that they were oppressed by soldier colleagues or misused sexually all and that the military failed to condemn to investigate or one appropriate according to jurisdiction the supposed attacks availably put., </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says she hunts the uppermost military leadership since the problem begins there. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The military is hierarchically built up&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who the single persons that are in the position are to exterminate the culture retaliation that one too? The leadership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke in addition says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Your strategy: Instead of all complainants putting so to speak their eggs into a basket, they submit many more complaints if necessary in order to receive the pressure uprightly. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of the defense for the Ministry of Defense, led by Federal state attorney Neil MacBride, made a request in order to reject complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the court that there are for Newsweek would bring on fully the defense strategy, in the first place, that the military can not be accused by present or former soldiers for injuries to whom it came in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Due to a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, the so-called Feres-doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries which are added to themselves in the active service of contained soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The probable damages arose during the military service of the complainants&quot;, says the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Ministry of Defense refuses every comment on this history. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The things have changed themselves since the 1950th years. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are not yet authorized for the service in the fight, the distinction is only like this in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in the contact tie with native women in the war fields. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in clashes, died. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it does not stand in their fight only there: three more complaints except for theirs are pendant. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At the Yale Law School the Veterans prepares &apos;Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of probable promotion of an anti-women atmosphere in front of. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Independently of that compiles the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America a complaint against the military before, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis &quot;Personality trouble&quot; that rape victims received in order to release her from the service - a usual approach according to activists as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women&apos;s Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Your group gave in December complaint against the Veterans administration (German: Administration of the war veterans) one, in which she reproached her for discriminating practices in their contact with achievement claims for persons that indicated to have been misused in the service sexually. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws was presented independent of each other through a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties that a series of clues offer the congress. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Responses Office became 2010 according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and (German: Office for prevention and announcement of sexual abuse) the Ministry of Defense&apos;s 3,158 sexual abuses indicated. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> Most of nevertheless the abuses are not announced at all and after the own estimate of the pentagon this number considers approx. 13.5 percent of the appreciated ones 19,000 cases to which it per annum comes. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report which was published in March examines also the prosecution rates: In 2010 20 percent of the understood cases in the military in court, only half as many as in the civil law, came. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Describe the complainants in Burkes case their attacks only as the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lymans case she announced the probable rape of the military police less than one hour after the assault. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> In this night, so she says, she was asked 11 times for telling the details of their rape a whole row from policemen, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It had a rape set and the blood of their assailant which came from a cut at his arm was found in their bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listened to by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex which she had before the infringement with their friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the supposed culprit who finally was absolved. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember still well the day, when the judgment was read out&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought the drifts would start. I ran shouting from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;You brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember, that I came out, than I again, to my commander said: That was not his procedure. That was my procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was asked to consult a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality trouble and declared it as unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> From January 2010 she was released dishonorably so that she does not receive any support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint which Lyman and the other complainants submitted gets on is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence, at the George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> In spite of that, so he says: &quot;According to my opinion they should get on.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine which is criticized since it was questioned for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am during one&apos;s lifetime a critic of the Feres-doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is wrong a decade afterwards, because they do not have the same stimulus and the same deterrent that brings a liability with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot;The chances stand against them... however it is important for them that they attempt it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will change themselves only then, if good people are ready fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will begin with their hundreds of other complainants for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will keep on fighting the military in this respect until it results in reforms&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whatever when first kicks in. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: Observing you as researchers on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he became the new face of the right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many Jungs who their anti-immigration opinion in an online way sent. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday having inspected Breivik which stood at an amok race in Norway in July at which 77 people were killed had his first public hearing in court. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik alone likes to have acted, it is not alone by far in the Cyberspace: He transferred a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, that support right-extreme groups on pages of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> According to the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find the way out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> However, how does one find it? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> That is easy - one must login only at Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We stated that it was not heavy to come to them&quot;, says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOS over the digital populism&apos;s in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks cache of personal data is so encyclopedic, it says to Bartlett that the researchers must simply use the advertising-tool of the page in order to define their wanted demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - be for Vermarkter so as it for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found half a million of fans of right-extreme groups in whole Europe and aimed for it then with Adds, nevertheless to link with a new band or a new diet product instead of himself, the Adds invited users in whom their education state, their attitude opposite power and the assessment of their own future were asked for to an inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were in the situation to consult more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without their having also had to leave their office only once. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a quite new research method&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results hardly surprise. Online conveyors of right-extreme groups are mostly young, masculine and are angry about the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a kind of surprising torsion are &quot;those ones, who combine their online activism with an off-line activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those ones that sitzen bleiben behind their computer screens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> DEMOs work is only an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page in order to study everything from health questions up to society trends as in &quot;Likes&quot;, plaintext messages and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users that three contents add on average per day Facebooks &quot;Data supernova&quot; generates a research boom that made the number of the scientific works with the name increase to this page in the title in the last five years around almost 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers the beautiful thing of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this page people who one does usually not reach with his clipboard on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;If you attempted formerly to consult people of the British national party, it was very heavy to identify it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to inform the party first and that one would never have given them admission&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;At Facebook that all is omitted - they go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the page offers a possibility social health problems to recognize and to solve. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues&apos; has found out that students that discussed their full drunkenness on Facebook tend to the problem-drinking significantly more strongly than students that kept quiet about this topic. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests, that control equally ranked students, for example living-consultants, the page and help a student, when this too much status updates postet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can not solve a problem if you have not recognized it&quot;, told Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and ladder of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children&apos;s Research institutes in Seattle of the Washington mail. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We found a possibility to identify endangered children who would not have been found differently.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook taps in addition constantly the data of his own population. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team of the page created statistics of the relationship status and Valentine&apos;s Day, poll at the Zwischenwahlen 2010 and a National luck index (at which in the first place information were used onto which only Facebook Zugriff has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the page should turn their big data treasure trove into research purpose accessibly for others.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Nevertheless the users of Facebook know that she observes the page whether they want that now or not. Around with a friend, to be able to play Scrabble the thousands&apos; of miles is removed, one allows the page to lower the own personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what, when the users of Facebook become Teil an inquiry, from which they do not know even something yet? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers are having severely defined guidelines as they gather their data in an off-line way, everything is allowed in an online way. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that many users thought anyway about the fact about a researcher being able to study their profiles&quot;, says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge rennet, for a study from the year 2006 in which he examined the public pages of students for Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;What affects it, it was a question only of them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is still the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> In an even off-line way there is not any guarantee, that a research participant is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What one says on Facebook and two completely different things are what one does outside of Facebook,&quot;, Selwyn says. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore Selwyn thinks in spite of his years as technology researchers that a clipboard and a convent are still the best research tools which everyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is not any substitute for that, into which to exceed real world and to speak with real people&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research must worry around the social thing - and every amount of social life occurs in a still off-line way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Different Behring Breivik appears for the first time in front of a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Different Behring Breivik, the man, of the two amok races has stood, at which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed, described itself in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo as a &quot;Widerstands&quot;kämpfer. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar Norwegens&quot;, he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I raise objection against the court since you received your mandate of organizations the hate ideologies support and because the multiculturalism is supported by that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, there it &quot;Breivik not the possibility wanted to give, to use this hearing as a platform on which it can express his opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused Breivik who brought along a first of all written speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim in addition ordered that the police Breivik keep for 12 more weeks in investigation custody it four weeks no access to the media has. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence exactly more than eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope to be able to look to Breivik into the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that it stays behind Schloss and bolt. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All participated with the objective, that everything comes to a locking away. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought it seems cold and inhuman&quot;, told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was unpleasant, but for me it continues a piece after I saw and heard the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik bore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed during the entire hearing quiet and professional. It looked to journalists and survivors into the eyes, than he entered the building and again left. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In spite of Breiviks bizarre tip, he would be a part one larger &quot;Widerstands&quot;bewegung, the judge to the conclusion came, that it is not insane and said that it would not give any proof of that that he had had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It likes to please to unite, that the attacks of the 22nd July was apparent the work of a single extremist and not that of a group radicals&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> However that facilitates automatically the grief and the confusion that a whole nation still senses? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wanted, it would look like a monster, but he does not do that&quot;, the member of a victim said. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be easier for so much if he did it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs, that was shown this week in a theater </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve jobs on 5th October compared unites it with Henry Ford and presented in this case the technique genius as a tall modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What Apple fans, however, think maybe most informatively in the recently again discovered job interview which one in this week in front of special screenings on the important markets was dusted is how very much this creative head understood business processes and workflows. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self appointed hippie, however he was also a meticulous organizer that tinkered eagerly with diagrams - a man that believed that many managers suffer from &quot;an illness of the thinking that a really splendid idea forms 90 percent of the work... [however] it enormous amount gives one at craft art between a splendid idea and a splendid product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995 bobsled Cringely developed the TV series &quot;Triumph of the compartment idiots&quot; about the departure of the personal computer. And he more long than an hour with jobs together sat in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> To this time were than 10 years last, since then jobs from Apple had been close. And he worked in an already hard way on his new computer enterprise NeXT, and looked forward to the wide assumption of the internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part was being used interview by Cringleys in compartment idiots, he says that the masters of the interview were missing during the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> First after jobs death discovered one a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> &quot;Steve&quot; forms this slightly reworked film material the basis for the 68-minute film &quot;jobs: The lost interview&quot;, that this Wednesday and Thursday into the country marrow theaters comes. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For somebody that is known to that that it detests detailed interviews, appears to jobs here surprisingly eagerly in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview it comes four times to longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of pondering, in which jobs considers unequivocal his thoughts and called in for accuracy is. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments, in which jobs &apos;Perfectionism to light comes to come in more quickly on topics or secondary actions of greater importance if apparently it reacts to Cringelys questions impatiently and anschubst it. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The Lost Interview appears received by Pixar, iPod or iPhone before the era somehow sinisterly farsightedly if jobs evaluates what other enterprises of his opinion correctly or wrongly do and his own vision to the future of the computer represents. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is a thing, posthumous assessments of the career jobs &apos;read. To see jobs here, however, as the desirous dreamer who is on the jump for the magnificence is a little very different, ingenious and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision as the things could be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> In a word after his having explained this here everything, he set out and it did. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A fast look onto seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> He learned how to lead an enterprise: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the whole years in the business I always ask: &quot;Why you do things&quot;?. And the answer that you always get is: &quot;Oh, it is simply made like this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks coming in above things after. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I arrested that. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs exports his efforts wider, to rationalize the bookkeeping at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly one began with &quot;Standard costs&quot; that were numbered onto bare supposition there and that then were adapted with &quot;deviation&quot; - it developed an automatized factory that guaranteed that the business costs could be determined to the smallest. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How the Pope became veralbert: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs tells about the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could creep into the telephone society and lead long-distance calls for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Already a lot was written about the device, however jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of the Selbstbemächtigung, is passing on. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how Wozniak and it would test the box, make a call when they use a chargeable telephone, and unite themselves then from a AT&amp;T-network into another while they are abrading as many satellites as possibly. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We sent things half a dozen once around the globe and if one bawled into the telephone, it came a minute again out later in the telephone next door&quot;, tells to jobs gigglingly. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we learned that we can establish even something that can control trillions of dollar at infrastructure on the whole world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We both, we did not know much, but we could build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that there would be Apple without them. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs keeps on telling of one glorious prank, that Wozniak and it has removed almost, than they called right in the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and with the Pope wanted to speak, during it so good they could imitate Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called right in the night in order to speak with the American diplomat, the two of them had to laugh away before the Pope came even onto the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> How he fell with the technique in love (and Bill Hewlett in an unprepared way called): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> In the age of 12 years, when he searched for spare parts in order to build a frequency counter he searched for Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly to their 20-minute telephone call kept for jobs for the summer a partial time job with Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only enterprise, that I had seen in the age and that shaped it my opinions about what an enterprise was and how it treated his employees well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs of one of the HP employees that went to the research laboratories of the enterprise in Palo Alto became later where it &quot;the first desktop computer, which ever was manufactured&quot; saw. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as large as a suitcase was, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell with it in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would climb at HP as teenagers up and love this machine and write programs for them. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How one corrects innovations: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Repeatedly in the interview jobs above how one invents spontaneously new products speaks. </seg>

<seg id="1659"> On the day at which the Supreme Court gathers behind shut doors in order to discuss the question splitting up politically whether one will listen to a contestation of the health laws of president Obama two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner that became gesponsort from the office that the case in court will represent. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident occurred last Thursday, than all nine judges for a discussion met in order to discuss about the petitions for the examination. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the too handled cases was a complaint that 26 states raised against the comprehensive reform of the health service that last year of the congress were decided, a law that became the catchword with the conservative activists everywhere in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact a 5 1/2-stündige basis discussion is expected in March, that presumably their result will stimulate the premiership fight that will be in the full walk to the time at which the court decision is announced presumable in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The attorney that suit in court and will say that the law is to be tilted will be Paul Clement presumable, once chief public prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen enterprises which the annual dinner of the Federalistic Society supported, an old-established group which dedicates itself to the defense of conservative right principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another enterprise, that the dinner sponsorte, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, that National Federation of Independent Business, who contest the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> A further sponsor was the pharmacy giant Pfizer Inc., that is financially enormously participated in the result of the process. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner occurred few hours in a Washington hotel after the court had discussed about the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Mitch McConnell, the faction leader of the republicans in the senate and a declared opponent of the health reform, had service among other things </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> That is not anything new: The two judges visit events of the Federalistic Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And that does not offend against moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Freed in fact judges from the behavior codex that controls the actions of the low federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were it, they would fall presumably under basic principle 4c of the codex which says following: &quot;A judge stands benefit performances law&apos;s of near and other organizations participate, at what the judge may be no speaker, guest of honor or aloud program no guest of one such events.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nonetheless gave the extreme proximity from Scalia and Thomas to two of the offices being related with the case as well as to an enterprise with a massive financial interest at this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the codex punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court holds itself onto the same rules that apply to all other federal judges&quot; Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA, said. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with floating procedures at the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Your appearance and their support of a donation action for this event untergraben any claim to neutrality and are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas show little consideration on critics, those ones say they would mix too easy for court matter with groups that can be guided by the agenda, as for example the Federalistic Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the Thomas &apos;A known conservative activist is wife Ginni. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The conservatives claim, that it is judge Elena Kagan, that has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was a general state attorney under the Obama-government when the first law contestations came in first authority in court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Your critics pushed Kagan, to pull oneself back from the hearing of the case because of prejudice since it is too very much engaged in the defense of the law in order to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> It does not make Kagan any institutions to do this. </seg>

<seg id="1685"> Airline emirates orders 50 double-threaded airplanes of the type of Boeing 777 with an option onto 20 more airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> In addition Boeing six sells Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business, to the value of more than 1 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is really a rare information that an enterprise gets a task above 50 pieces of his products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a big business, when the enterprise of the airplane manufacturers Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes lies in total with a record sum of 18 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The customer of Boeing is just as unusual: the Middle East, a wachsende gold mine of future airplane orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a prediction which was published on Monday the Chicagoer enterprise reckons that Fluggesellschaften needs 2,520 airplanes from the Middle East in the coming 20 years to the value of 450 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced at the weekend his greatest task of all times for commercial airplanes, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-threaded Boeing 777 jets. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The hammer task came of the airline emirate from Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline in addition has, so Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai aviation show, an option onto the purchase of 20 more airplanes that makes to the entire list price climb 26 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On Monday Boeing Oman Air six ordered then aloud Boeing 787-8, the so genannten Dreamliner which improves the mileage and the comfort of the passengers enormously. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The list price for six of these airplanes is near more than 1 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;That is absolute positively for Boeing&quot;, said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist of Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these special customers is very high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> There are many airlines of the Middle East in the possession of the countries producing oil. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore they do not have only the money in order to pay the airplanes. Rather a rise of the oil prices that normally damages the airlines since this of one of their biggest matters of expense is is not so harmful since the country deserves at a higher oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> That is important, since she said less to airplane orders than other airlines for this purpose tend, to cancel or to postpone if the oil prices increase Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;You have a natural safeguard&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of emirate confirms Boeings leadership position on the market for jumbo jets and it helps to hold the airbus competitor to SAS in chess that attacks the supremacy with the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeings victory on the aviation show comes four months after airbus announced one would postpone the introduction of the largest A350 which competes directly with the 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> One postponed the introduction in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher working load and range. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The Boeing-stocks increased about 1.5% to $ 67.94. </seg>

<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon claims, who drug traders supported opponents to Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race around the governor post. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Apparently the sister of president Felipe Calderon lost their application for the office of the governor from Muchoacan during the violent state choices. She said on Monday drug traders would have influenced the race for the benefit of one of their opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> According to the provisional results Fausto Vallejo won the race from the Institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, around the governor post in the western state. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of the organized crime during the entire choice processes and is especially on the day of yesterday alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country&quot;, Luisa Maria Calderon said a day in a radio interview after the choice on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;You threatened our candidates, our employees&apos; in the inquiries... you filled voting booths, built up street blockades... and people charges to vote [for the PRI].&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI controlled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the premiership in the year 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes for a victory in the premiership choice in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to only just have beaten Claderon that had led in the inquiries before the choice day still. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of their brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as winners. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic revolution party PRD, the currently still current governor, came to place Three, a difficult defeat, for the fissured and luckless left leadership for the premiership choice 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Also Aureoles refused to acknowledge the provisional results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traders and pushes the other candidates, to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacan was mastered long time by drug cartels that specialized on marihuana, heroin and amphetamines. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the native country of president Calderon and it chose Michoacan, to start a militarily led offensive in December 2006 against drug traders. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The power still lasts. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A PAN-mayor was killed a week in front of the choice during a choice event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates got out of fear from the local choices. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, regardless, as disgustingly the choices also appear in Michoacan. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the running around the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: &quot;I think that this victory makes us look in the next year courageously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> ADB pushes Asia onto help in the rescue of the euro zone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The development bank of Asia (Asian Development Bank, ADB) appeals to India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in his hard fault crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend which will slow down the growth of the economy of Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, administration manager of the ADB with seat in Manila, said that the two of them must be most quickly for wachsenden economic nations of the world &quot;everything standing in your power&quot; in order to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Currency Ground or through direct mutual agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> It warned against the BRIC-countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look &quot;dispassionately&quot; at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and the European resources helps through Asia with preventing a long-term breakdown of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are in the same boat all of them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore everyone which can help Europe from this crisis is&quot; helpful, he the Financial Times said in an interview on the fringe of the world economy forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia likes to be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;If therefore China and India can help, then with all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Europe&apos;s monetary union got in the last months into a hard fault crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In the last days Italy&apos;s interest costs went up dangerously and the prime ministers both of Italy and of Greece resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The arising hard fault crisis in Europe stirs up fears, that the global economy could fall into the recession and added calls, that leading newly industrialized countries would have to put together in order to support the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag predicted, that every support of Asia is sewered through the IWF, said, however, that mutual agreements - how for example the purchase of Bonds of the EU rescue ground, the Europäische Finanzstabilisierungsfazilität (EFSF) - that greater bargaining power offers to European partners in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Indian Secretary of Commerce, said that &quot;India&quot; will do &quot;all which stands in his power&quot; in order to help the euro zone since the own economy suffers now from the sinking exports and the draining of foreign capital flow. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the euro zone unstably and uproariously to keep on staying&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We stand before great challenges and we must receive a high growth level.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, it is a task, because where otherwise find we work for our millions of young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue, that developing economies as India did not help the rich Europeans any cause if they themselves stand before great economical challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US American Brown University, said that it would be politically very much heavy to sell to the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or still little on day live at the. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 retire and spend vacations at the beach. Then one has a problem&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, administration manager of the world economy forum, asked similarly why India&apos;s reserves should be used in order to keep the numerous and well paid employees in Greece in the public service with jobs in bad saw, facilities being losses worth as about of the railroad. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the crises will have &quot;significant domino effects&quot; on whole Asia in the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The prediction of the ADB with an economic growth around 7.5 percent in Asia for the years of 2011/droht now the risk of the grading due to the threatening danger from Europe. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the pentagon of possible incisions in the defense being </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense minister Leon Panetta gave off a good heat to the congress on Monday, when it warned against automatic budget shortenings weakening the national security without being noticed. In this way it solved a financial nuclear chain reaction from the halls of the pentagon up to the theaters of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The pentagon thinks over already shortenings at the level of 450 trillion dollars in the course of the coming decade, fears now, however, that further shortenings become necessary around 600 trillion dollars or more if the congress can not achieve any end in the editions. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The effects of these shortenings would be disastrous for the ministry&quot;, wrote Panetta John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, in a letter onto the republican senators. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said, a failure of the congress in the achieving of a budget agreement, what will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead a stop of numerous new projects to general shortenings to 23% as well as. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a high shortening, carried out in such thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and damage other modernization efforts seriously&quot;, wrote Panetta the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would be in addition forced, to separate us from a majority of our civilian personnel compulsorily and since the reduction was turned over so quickly we would have to relieve civilians with probability verging on security in order to be able to reach the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would destroy the belief of the ones who receive our military uprightly and damage our alert seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Finally the shortenings hit the combat troops&quot;, Panetta said. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While the wartime contingents are being directly not affected by the seizure in the antiterror fight, the fatal intervention in the basic budget would influence the war efforts disadvantageously&quot;, Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;Personnel attitudes shortened, what to delays in the attitudes and the attitude supervision that supports the war would lead.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The salaries of the personnel would be shortened, what leads to late payments onto wartime traders and the legal one as also political support would be faulty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators answered to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details concerning the potential influence of the automatic shortenings on the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defense would initiate a fast downfall of the United States as leading military power of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are vehement against this Draconian action&quot;, said the senators in a common declaration on Monday afternoon, when they published to Panettas letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is a result with which we can not live, and it is not certainly any one that one should force on us.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The seizure is a threat of the national security interests of the United Statten and their entry should not be allowed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands, to wait to exclude the pentagon from shortenings, remains. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta expressed increasingly bluntly the possible shortenings although it could gain experiences with the budget many years in the congress and in the White House, before it came onto the top of the pentagon, and he knows that it suits difficult decisions opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> On a press conference in the last week the defense minister painted it a dark picture what could approach - a military with shell, but without core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without ammunition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air force wing without sufficiently trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers which are in the situation to fulfill the mission&quot;, said Panetta in his opening address in the pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is some armed forces which lacks morality and alert and which is not in the situation to match potential opponents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;It makes one become furious in fact.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters at McCain and Graham Panetta mentioned new details, as reductions &quot;significant functional risks creates: Delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our worldwide use and intervening ability, what leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the greatest defense projects of the cancellation could fall victim including the ones that already were tested and are already in the early planning stage. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Also the combat pilot F35 Joint Strike Fighter belongs to this list, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground assault vehicle, the Army and navy need in order to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> One stopped the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollars, but the proponents say that it is an important next step to the rearmament so that possible dangers through China and other opponents can be excommunicated. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How one enttarnt a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look onto the current headlines shows how dubious and widespread delusion and lie are in the daily life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The premiership candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is occupied with that, the accusations of sexual molestation on the part of several women to become gentleman. Both pages are accused mutually of the lie. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The management of Penn State is accused of the Meineids since one supposedly held reports according to which a pensioned American football coach abused boys sexually back. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the last week, when the French President of the State Nikolas Sarkozy claimed opposite the American president Barack Obama heard about an open microphone, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shake countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congress representative and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner turned himself into the fool when he made circulate denials that were refuted very quickly by irrefutable proofs. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former premiership candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in the campaign financing that stands in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then nobody who experienced it forgets of course the media circus which president Bill Clinton released when he lay during his second term of office in the oval Office concerning his sexual relationship to Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Histories above Schummeln in the school and with college-examinations are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were incidents in the case of which teachers set their students the examination answers so that they themselves stood with their achievement inspections well. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors that should teach the opposite send an information, that lies and Schummeln are okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much delusion do we experience? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many these lies be valid, however, as white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that foreigners lie to themselves mutually three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> One which to learn for every human being is important, and this is to recognize lies and/or &quot;To uncover lying&quot; both from personal as also for professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Remote far from a society game as for example charades in which it is the objective, &quot;Have you&quot;! calling is the Enttarnen of a delusion a serious knowledge field that is based on scientific data that were gathered in the course of the last six decades at universities looked at that comprehensive research projects carried out in particular in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> A result of the research is that most old myths were enttarnt about the lying. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies look to one into the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> You stutter, stammer blush and do not fidget always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> One must not conclude, however, that to uncover these liars heavily and to enttarnen are. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A practiced Lügenenttarner can penetrate for the truth, when it something fine about the structure of the Behauptung,die facial expressions, about question formulation and timing learns. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years with examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly wachsenden field of the exposure. And it is clear especially that the Enttarnen of a delusion is a modern ability that is to be learned easily and helps us in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world, when the adjustment or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration for the own professional responsibilities belong. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good in assessing other people whose to wake interest and to master the own emotions. And they sense intuitively how they are perceived by others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research we know, that extrovert people more frequent lie as introvert people, that men &quot;orientated&quot; more frequent &quot;self&quot; Serve lies as women whose lies more orientate by others - normally want to protect they in this way the feelings other -, that married people lie to their partners frequently less than single people (but the lies that they tell are mostly &quot;fat lies&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that others feel less guilty to have lain to this person if a person was enttarnt as a malefactor. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How does one recognize whether anyone lies? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> When first, when you observe the normal behavior of this person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> One mentions that &quot;Baselining&quot;, the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> She sets a reference point for the later evaluating of changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their experimental person. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know better when anyone trips usually constantly with the foot so that they do not accuse him incorrectly if he trips during a meeting with the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Do not consider these accumulations as an evidence of an exposure as alarm bells, the shrill ones. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Maybe people who deceive are petrified if they attempt to remember their history. Maybe show their feet in the direction to Tür or they lean in direction exit, they change their position in significant way or they show a &quot;relaxation after the interview&quot;, this deep, easing exhalation and the change in the attitude, if all hard questions are past. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Enquirers signal often by mistake that an interview is by only in order to hold look-out after this relaxation after the interview. </seg>

<seg id="1862"> Climatic adversities moderated the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government the unemployment and the illicit work increased in Sinaloa while the foreign investments were going back and the economy was stagnating. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> In 2011 Sinaloas will stay in the economic history in memory. It is the first year at which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself even the initiator of the change and stirred up great hopes concerning the economic growth, is at the government. Yet due to the climatic adversities it can not be talked about growth, but on the contrary the most important economic indicators worsened. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February did not cause only losses in million height in the agriculture, but they in addition put narrow borders to the growth of the public economy and caused in the first quarter a general drop of the economic activity around 3.6 percent of These goes back mainly onto the historical disassembly of the agricultural development around 31.16 percent, that braking onto further sectors of the economy affected. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to a report handed over by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (German Mexican council for lasting agricultural development) about the effects of the frost were damaged estates 582 000 hectares agriculturally used, of what 78.03 percent complete and were destroyed the remaining 21.07 percent partial. Affected were particularly the vegetable, May and chickpea building. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The drop of the economic activity until November made in the Mexican state the unemployment go up continuously. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter a fast rise of the unemployment, because of January until March 55 053 inhabitants Sinaloas did not have any employment, what 4.53 percent of the acquisition population corresponds. In the second quarter the unemployment rate went up on 5.28 percent and of July until September onto 6.19 percent, which results 74 000 unemployed persons in the consequence in Sinaloa. Those ones are 18 969 persons more than in the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Smaller liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the department of economic and social sciences of the university Autónoma (UAS), comments on the politics of the public institutions explaining the wachsende unemployment indirectly. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we currently observe is a rise of the unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things with liquidity losses on the market due to the mid shortenings through the legislation that was adopted for the abatement of the money laundry in the congress because for those ones that pile up dollar illegally it is not to be invested easily to make these for itself be worked or for to use something otherwise&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration stopped </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes referred to also a demographic factor being inherent in the wachsenden unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of the persons who leave the country in search of work abroad, in particular in the United States, went back. On the one hand that is to be put down to the entry problems and on the other hand, to find work because it is also there difficult. These people stay here and search work here, what makes the unemployment go up&quot;, he thinks. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Illicit work </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more fatal if one considers the high part of the illicit work. This contains according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the ones Busy in the country, those ones work without paying into the cash boxes of the social security. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> To the unemployment and illicit work the low wages, the lowest in whole Mexico, come according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican social security institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government authority for work and social welfare in Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average month income of the employees in Sinaloa was until September 5352 pesos; that is very much much less than the entire state average which is near 7375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Drop of the ADI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Next to the disassembly of the economic activity and the wachsenden unemployment the strongest drop of the foreign direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years is noted in the year 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority) the ADI of January was until June 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to a decrease of 87.74 percent in comparison with the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government authority for economical development) records a total investment for her part at the level of 17 280 000 pesos in the year 2011 that comes before all things from enterprises from the tertiary sector. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The debts </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Faced with the depression the central government applied in July at 000 000 pesos which should be invested in infrastructure projects for the reactivation of the economy in the 18 municipalities for a credit during the national congress at the level of 3 000. The country congress approved an amount at the level of 200 600 000 pesos, however, no positive effects of the indebtedness onto any of the branches of trade in the country could be found until November. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> For the representatives the entrepreneur shaft did the first government year Mario López Valdés government impotence obvious. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, chairpersons&apos; of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of the using industry in Mexico) held that in the year 2011 no efforts were turned into the harmonization of the opinions of the different sectors, including the central government. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The economic activity in Sinaloa was really this year very poor. Must be worked hard, in order to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we must try hard twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already government teams well gotten on each other in the mood were not matched with each other sufficient&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Slow business trend </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López expressed, that events, as the frost to year beginning complicated and slowed down the business trend of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The small economic river is the result of several events, and other of the frost. One of the most important effects is to cause an economy slowed down which is not sufficient in motion around an economic dynamics which could produce an acceptable river of processes, products and services. Therefore we will &quot;close&quot; the year far below our expectations&quot;, it thought. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Defining appointment again </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairperson of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneur association of Mexico) in Sinaloa declared one must lead the state to more dynamic productive activities. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In general we observed that was worked. We believe, that it necessarily a long-term program is to be developed into the re-assay of the economical appointment and line of the country, because it is to activate all material and humane resources Sinaloas important&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Doing a lot gives </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The chairperson of Coparmex showed how developing a future perspective which steers the efforts of the government into better railways importantly is. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;In general I would say that the government achieved good results in different fields. The economical development came ahead, but a long-term program is to be developed importantly&quot;, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> It stressed that the present state power did progress near the government. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> &quot;There are fields, with regard to which one can say, that the government acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that was worked and that the government is conscious that another amount work lies before it&quot;, he expressed. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Arrest because of 8 kg of marihuana </seg>
<seg id="1899"> To five years of prison and was condemned 100 day etching an inhabitant of Navolato because of the possession of eight kilos of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> The prosecution of the republic announced the drug merchant is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval that was punished for a crime against the public health - here the possession of marihuana determined to the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested at the 7th Junio 2010 by Mexican militaries during the supervision of the street Cipriano Valdez opposite the sentry no. 80 in the small town El Castillo, Navolato. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The drug merchant went in a white van, in which it kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small rucksack, in which the militaries found eight kilos and 23 grams of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> For this reason the confiscated product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punished one keeps on being in the execution institution. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Debts for construction works </seg>
<seg id="1905"> The social constructions planned in the programs Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants run danger, not to be finished because of missing means or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda meant. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The state government declared the ladder of the urban authority for social development there that they float although the schedules of work already continued now in danger the means being entitled her to, that for the three programs 11 million cross peso, not has paid. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> He said, the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million peso, from which 25 percent fell on the state. Until now only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed means to the construction works, for which a delay of the construction termination is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> &quot;12&quot; million must contribute it, and although the year already draws to a close, they have us no pfennigs given, and that although they would have &quot;had&quot; to pay us a part already in July&quot; he thought. &quot;In order to be not too late at that, we already began with the construction works, and they continued already far, but we need the money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1909"> He emphasized that under the government from Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state did not follow his obligations, for which the municipality had to take up a credit at the beginning of his government at the level of 7 million. That would correspond to the amount which the central government would have had to find. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;That was already in the last legislative period to us like this gone, because the state did not have sufficient economical means. The programs liefen weiter and this year we had to get the means which the state had not found for ourselves in order to participate in these programs&quot;, he exported. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Even if the state authorities are obliged to the payment of these means, it commented, that with the minister of administration and finances, to speed up the administrative works and to pay the outstanding part as quickly as possibly, was applied. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> &quot;Almost 12&quot; million must contribute it, and although the year already draws to a close, they have us no pfennigs given.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The court approves the crossing onto the digital television in Mexico for 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The adaptation of the analogous ones to digital signals belongs in the last years to the most important changes worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Uppermost court of justice of Mexico (SCJN) showed the constitution complaints that were submitted by the senate and the parliament against the presidential decree and must be brought forward by virtue of the the switchover of analogous onto digital signals of 2021 on 2015, due to lacking eight voices that are necessary to the law contestation back. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, under that also the president of the Uppermost Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, thought the president Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he handed over the law decree with the details about the switchover on the terrestrial digital television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this decision the constitution quarrel started up by the senate was refused since he did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight voices so that the court can decide itself on the constitution moderateness or the non-Verfassungsmäßigkeit. The law in force remains like this. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> In the project for the complaint that was elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero it was suggested to declare the law decree as unconstitutional there for those ones regulations affecting the radio and the television the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Feather ale commission for telecommunication in Mexico) responsible is, for which the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservations. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> For the benefit of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument both the senate and the chamber of deputies submitted constitution complaints against the law decree. According to assumption of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero did not use the law decree anymore and stopped all activities to the equipment of the digital transfer. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The Council of Ministers refused also the complaint submitted by the chamber of deputies without kicking in into the debate about the project for which also the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed, not to be agreed on the arguments of the project, and indeed in the sense that the country government must not adjust with general rules the measures that the public administration is supposed to take. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I do not believe either that the independence of the regulation place would be influenced if one did that&quot;. It reminded also of that, that for the planning of strategic political fields, as for example the sector of the telecommunication, for constitution-legal reasons the central-governmental government responsible is, because this leads the state affairs. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitute of the analogous signals through digital is one of the most important changes that occurred in the last years on the whole world and it causes a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> The postponing of the adaptation, it thought a postponing of the usufruct of the digitalization is what a decision that has points of view not only technical is in the public interest because she grasps economical, social, political and safeguarding aspects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> It accentuated, these matters, &quot;required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of the economical management through the state they contained a group of features that the constitution puts into the hands of the central-governmental government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> It called into the memory, that many countries would already have carried out the digital adaptation worldwide, and indeed over the government, although they were in charge of highly specialized facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> One can not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree intervenes in the competences of the congress, because the laws passed by the legislative would be kept&quot;, she assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> To count out the possibility separately the ballot papers in Michoacán is taken into consideration </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the information of PREP the difference between the first and the second place during the choice of the governor is just 27 percent at which 879 voices were not counted out by in total 6074 yet. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of the single counting of the ballot papers is this year at the choices a reality in Michoacán, because according to the data distributed by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place at the governor choices is just 27 percent at which 879 voices were not counted out by in total 6074 yet. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this sense the president of the Consejo reminded general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the choice place having just adopted a row of regulations for the harmonization of the local rules with the reforms of the Federal states in choice matters once on the last 9th one November. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> It is reminded of that that yet his law had not adapted either his political constitution or his choice law to Michoacán about the choice justice onto the reforms adopted by the congress so that these had not come into force with this choice round. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state indicator within the periods of time planned for that with the argument, still to have objections to that. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> On 9th November the Uppermost court of justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on constitution complaint submitted over that one by the local legislative and the voice of the state representative for the constitution reforms judged as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; too since this does not have the right about that &quot;decide or on the other hand to insert a veto&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> María de los Ángeles Llanderal declared with an interview about the possibility of the single counting of the voices that thanks to the assumption of the guidelines through the Consejo general del IEM the possibility that the local choice authority can count out the ballot papers in part or completely would exist now. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> So can under the following conditions the The results will make in voices contained to a or several choice parcels in part counted out in the protocols not ueberein; there are not the protocols about the voice counting and calculation file-moderately or it is not in the possession of the chairperson of the choice committee or there are obvious errors or alterations in the protocols. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> In addition the total counting of the completely filled voter registration cards can occur, when there is a difference between the supposed winner and the one that stands on the second place, the same or smaller than a percent is, an explicit request is presupposed at the beginning of the meeting of the parties-and/or. Coalition chairpersons before, that is the second of the mentioned candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The scrutiny can occur also in their entirety if on completion of the tidy calculation it is stated that the difference is identical or smaller between the supposed winner and the candidate on the second place than a percent presupposed there is an explicit request of a representative of the party that candidate Zweiter became. In this case the choice parcels would be excluded that a partial counting was exposed to. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It is Erwähnenswert that the choices are in Morelia in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference is just 0.16 percent between the first and the second place although the voices were not counted out by 129 of in total 923 choice protocols yet. </seg>

<seg id="1976"> On Wednesday education of the new Italian government </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow the president of Italy in order to introduce the new government which is supposed to offer the forehead to the crisis which led Italy onto the edge of the economic breakdown to this. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow the president of Italy in order to introduce the new government which is supposed to offer the forehead to the crisis which led Italy onto the edge of the economic breakdown to this. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A communication from the premiership palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday in order to confirm the government education. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Goes out from that that he will introduce a cabinet mainly put together from technocrats although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said he would present the results of the conversations with the political parties for the government education to the President of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to become ready with these difficult times&quot;, said the former EU superintendent to the journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not confirm the government education expressly, but it follows from his comments that the obstacles are overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &quot;frame is now well marked out&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti got it into less as three days, to form a government, that is much less time than in a normal way. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which drove the costs into an intolerable height for the debts. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The government new, led by the former EU superintendent Monti must say goodbye a hard saving-parcel that was demanded by the euro politicians in order to retrieve the changed confidence in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The pressure for the hurry that burdens Monti still intensified through the varying market, due to which the Italian state loans for 10 years with 7 percent of interests were loaded. That corresponds to apply the European rescue screen at the state with which Greece and Ireland saw themselves forced. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria informed the press after a meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support this government according to all strengths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this government is the last chance so that Italy comes out of this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The success chances Montis were increased by the support of the party PDL from Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis, considerably. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> &quot;We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are certain in order to cause good results&quot;, said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right-party. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because until now many of their members spoke out against a government mainly consisting of technocrats which just forms Monti. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Support of the parliament </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Resistance to his efforts or the putting off of the reforms could cause once again a disastrous attack of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks exerts also pressure with his tip a failure Montis is a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneur associations as well as with youth and woman organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Tuesday evening is supposed to be closed the meeting round. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano that put an extremely fast government change in motion in response to the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After short reviving by the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign due to the insecurity about the success of the new Prime Minister the costs reached again critical borders for the Italian state loans. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> A rescue of Italy with a national debt at the level of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the present EU rescue screen. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said his government must last up to the next choices to probably be kept off in the year 2013 in spite of the forecasts that the politicians will give him only time for the conversion of the reforms the choices starts prefer. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti expressed, he would receive politicians into his cabinet gladly, but the large parties insist on this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their objections faced with the procedure imposed from the pressure of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Show political sources there, that the mutual distrust and the disagreements between the lots make the inclusion complicated by persons from the political life. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Spaniards have more game occasions as the Ticos </seg>

<seg id="2012"> In addition the experiences with the Spanish fury come in the case of complicated qualifying matches with the euro cup and the soccer world championships. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> On the other hand the Tico-footballers have few international meetings within the framework of the Concacaf which stands on the FIFA ranking list very below. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> We will see, as the Spanish team their last register pulls: The goalkeeper Iker Casillas who reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games. </seg>

<seg id="2035"> On this day they occur from 19.30 o&apos;clock in the national stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> You read a departure from the conversation whose complete duplicate is to be found by La Nación in the online-edition. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For your Costa Rican fans a dream is fulfilled if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you conscious to yourselves, which means that for your fans? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> In Costa Rica a dream is to be played which is fulfilled also for us. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> That is just the second time once, that we in South- and play Central America, and until now it was splendid. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I was only once in Costa Rica to the vacation. It is a so wonderful country that we will remain still a few days there designated. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> For us it is exciting to bring our music there there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask that to you because the fans are the band completely turned out. You experience the days most intensely before the concert. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank to stand all these years at our page. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> We needed almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thanks, to have waited for so long and we are sorry about having needed for so long until we came here. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even think that your concert will become the greatest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> A little pressure does not carry that out your visit from? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the most splendid shows which we put down in the last 21 years occurred in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope for those ones doing us fitly for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Real, we fancy playing there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we surf gladly and we are enthusiastic from the jungle. For that Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did you become acquainted with Costa Rica and his waves for the surf? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Many of ours friend are surfer and I have a splendid friend that lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for the surf. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for the surf. In this way, about people, that the surf love, we heard about that. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> With a look onto the tour you offered giant shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Which plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Since we have never played there yet, we do not set ourselves also any borders. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will attempt to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat your repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe, that is partially like this because we can have nine plates and play them about 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision which we will play in each case is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> If we incorporate two or three songs that we did not play more already longer into the repertoire, we can receive our concentration better uprightly and they surprise us because the reasons call it to us into the memory why these songs fell to us. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the public. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour you celebrate your twenty year long history. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, total. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> At first once I believe that nobody of us imagined to play once in a splendid skirt band and that also still more than 20 years long. That works as a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We put also further on this blessing and think it fabulous to be able to do music still together also now. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We like ourselves and are enthusiastic of producing music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are able to have gone luck onto the places of the world to which we wanted to go always once. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could not stand better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What meant for you to have participated in the birth of the Grunge actively? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It was always an honor to belong to this group of large bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are gotten used well with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising and plenty unusual if a movement follows from a group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Occasionally a band follows from a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come simultaneously from the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of that and feel honored, to be part the Seattle group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we play still together. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In the last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are pleased, to be gotten used still with them all and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle-Sounds. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very much unusual, that a band as yours with the same musicians has stayed together for so long time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us are playing already for 21 years together and check mate (Cameron) bumped 13 years ago to us. That alone already much more time is than many bands überdauern. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At first once I still believe that we consider ourselves all happy at the life his and in addition we take care of each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We all are narrow friend, for which musical ways opened up that give every individual the freedom for the experimentation. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> Familiar to one the other one and his music. We could not feel better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the fame was not always simple. On the other hand you could always do thanks to your success what you wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The kind as we grew it made simpler to us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We guarantee, not too often to be on tour, because it is too easy to succumb to this game with gigantic crowds that love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as one thinks of the people coming because of the music, that reminds you of your having to respect the music and what she started up without being crazy on that a famous skirt star be. That anyhow never interested us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Which memories do you have onto your other project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe, we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was splendid. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were for three years a band which had never handed over a plate up to the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed over having needed for so long. We are gotten used still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that built up the band with us. If I hear a song or see photos, I think of which incredible human being Andy was and how it made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh together and to talk about music and soccer and many other topics. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was an exceptional person and we miss it. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> Is the domestic band Las Robertas for the opening of the show in Costa Rica responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It makes select in particular Eddie Vedder, and the band therefore for the opening that you know their works have? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us to videos from several groups and we liked this band best. Because of that seeing what can offer Las Robertas live curious we are. That is determined tightening. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter if you play live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder) I do not have any presentiment. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it, and I believe, he sings the First that he remembers. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom were you influenced as a bass player? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Of so vielen+ </seg>
<seg id="2103"> To the First ones to be remembered by me Geezer butlers, John Entwistle, belong to C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many that I could talk about the bass players who I like the whole afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How did it create Pearl Jam to keep the Grunge to the life although it is not a question of a fashion appearance more? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe, we all do not feel very united with the word Grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> If I think about that, I remember the bands that I mentioned before for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others that arose at the same time. If they are important also today still, I find that splendid, because this music rewards for it hear and bands as Mudhoney do now better music before than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning their music was darker, now it is more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> That is interesting, because I believe, there are a few songs on the new album that could weave something carelessly. But there are also other songs as The End or Just Breathe who are classified as very dark songs who being had also something positive at themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> To both of them the tears came to me when I heard how Ed played it. There are very dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe, when you get older and a little traumatic in your life has passed influenced - e.g. when one loses a dependant or a friend - that your artistic work and your music and these two songs embody that unequivocally for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think, however, that one can be a happy human being and do dark music in spite of that. </seg>

<seg id="2149"> Except for Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquín because of murder and hard bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both because of drug traffic, are left. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> The procedure Coloms is a government act which occurs if all judicial and constitution-legal authorities for the condemnation of the former Staaatspräsidenten (2000 -2004) are emptied. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> According to the decisions of the Fifth Punishment Yard and the constitution court of Guatemala Portillo must be handed over if his right situation is clarified in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> Portillo was absolved for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his government. These negotiations preceded to the delivery, but the minister inserted contradiction and stimulated the case again. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Trinijove helped 6000 people young, threatened from the social exclusion </seg>
<seg id="2154"> The organization was started up to avoid the Marginalisierung by young people without professional training. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> The first 25 years of the social welfare organization Trinijove led to important results: 6000 people young, threatened from the social exclusion were supported in this quarter century in order to find a way out from their difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> In addition the jobs gotten over hundred for this social group come. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> On the occasion of the anniversary balance was drawn yesterday by Fabra i Coats, which more than 300 persons participated in, at an event in the former work buildings. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> Trinijove was started up in 1986 in the quarter Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with small training state, without work, with drug problems which were threatened from the risk of the Marginalität. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Numerous persons responsible of facilities and institutions who cooperated with the association during these 25 years participated in the celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The participation of political representatives of different directions at election campaign times proved the neutrality of the work achieved by Trinijove. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Except for the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Catalonia Region), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor took at the ceremonies and at present link-green town council Ricard Goma teil. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Also the present Catalan minister of social one and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the president of the public social aid of the savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, went to the big hall of Fabra i Coats. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mas stressed that Trinijove was started up in very difficult times and that the present times are not less complicated. But he added that the work achieved until now is a good basis. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> For the president of the Generalitat Trinijove is a model, that to fight against difficult circumstances white and people in trouble gives hope. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> &quot;The depression is not anything new&quot; for the association and the work which it achieves&quot;, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Busy house in which giant parties were organized was evacuated </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The house-owners had filled 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at the street of Balmes no. 51 (Barcelona). </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without having achieved resistance. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything refers to the nightmares of the neighbors of the house no. 51 thinking an end of the street Balmes. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve persons left yesterday noon the building voluntarily, who fills it illegally held and in that they had organized gigantic celebrations, that had driven the neighborhood for the despair. The clearing occurred on judicial order without without police intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> After the clearing the door lock was exchanged in order to avoid a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From now on the admission will be controlled&quot;, confirmed the house supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters who had filled 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the remaining ones were inhabited - took along the entire electric installation and part of the water supply. In addition they had painted the walls and all kinds of garbage leave behind, particularly cans with alcoholic drinks. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In the three lower floors gigantic Partys were celebrated which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants for the despair. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> There is a disco, Balmes 51 which took also damages from that, next to the building. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Your holder, Maria Pantinat declared Europe Press that their business would have fallen off about 80% since beginning of the house occupation. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the disco referred to the squatters doing her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros while these were costing 10 euros in the disco. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> In addition the owner of the leisure time restaurant had been announced by the neighbors because of disturbance, during aloud their statement the noise not of the visitors the disco came, but of the squatters and in particular of the guests of the celebrations that were organized there, and that became according to statements of the annoyed neighbors in the last weeks more and more and longer. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The person responsible of the disco declared that the molestation was so great that they came with the owner of the building ueberein, not to have to pay any rent for the last nine months. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Also the Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she received more complaints of the neighbors in the last weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The chairperson the PP (Partido Popular - people&apos;s party) in the town council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week had demanded, to evacuate the building immediately and to get the problems of the middle class coexistence as well as the coming down of the quarter into the grip. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> It declared that before the summer only a floor of the building was busy, but that the squatters had advanced into all floors of the building and almost all apartments in the last months. Into some it had resulted even in thefts. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense he added that it is necessary to put an end to the impunity and to act against the unsocial actions in the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday a further building was evacuated in the quarter Nou Barris by the Catalan police. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 15.30 o&apos;clock the police came closer to the street Montral no. 35 after she had received a call of a neighbor which had observed how four persons wanted to penetrate the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The Four of them were arrested immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects are agreed on the announcement apart from the quarrels about the fees. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban announcement about the 16 gates starts the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the middle of the 1980th years, to the climax of the meanwhile disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published their abusing-writing about the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona city. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> It was compared even in numbers with the Central Park by New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the fall of the CMB in the year 1987 the park became the upper limit of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few ones that does not expand in north south direction but up (Mountains) and below (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Now no more the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogibärs served as a model. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far was one, as the city in September a giant announcement, existing from 16 competitions, for further access gates according to Collserola distributed. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Beyond doubt a fool refers to the draft of a park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that is like this, or somebody plans to put gates on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question surrenders by itself: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The announcement is the topic not only from organizational view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Already almost a recurrent topic is which two members of this caste in an old way resident that meets in the elevator can fall back to. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare correspondences between what three architects think about that from Barcelona, and some professors that applied onto the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The announcement is adequate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán &quot;it is necessary&quot; to speak after the attack onto the coast over the &quot;front at the mountains&quot;, so far the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that has been delivered aus over the green apples, not. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;One should take the principle as a basis, that Barcelona&apos;s biggest park is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is well accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex&quot;, the architect judges, for that of the titles a &quot;lexical trap&quot; in themselves &quot;Gates from Collserola&quot; brings out: One may they not &quot;than accesses to a park introduce, but as a delimitation of fields on which must act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with city-structural experience, considers the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; which contains &quot;some dangers&quot; in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers due to the &quot;insecurity, which brings the organization of a public room nowadays with itself&quot; after the experiences from the 1980th years to have their &quot;swan song&quot; in the field of the forum. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first apprehension is the own limitation to what may be built on. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;To delimit something always means to define the next step&quot; that is to cross it. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;One must think about new city-structural planning instruments, because the present ones [with reference to the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol that sticks to the question more closely means, the page of Collserola that Vallesana goes in the direction simplifies &quot;can&quot; be understood &quot;as a park, that in direction Barcelona not&quot;, and indeed for reasons topographical in that. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol reminds of there being already a study of the patronage de Collserola that should not bump onto deaf ears although it is thankful to the municipal administration that it gave his committee the possibility to participate in this project &quot;at first sight&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition he says that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter that it makes for the architects possible to participate in the debate although he expresses his &quot;doubts&quot; about that whether this technical profile should instruct the multidisziplinären teams started up (&quot;exactly the correct thing, he says) We architects should be only a tool.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona points out that the answer to the question is complex in the heading of this article since in the announcement conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: &quot;16 competitions were advertised in the cross-section&quot;, he, &quot;on the axis mountains-sea&quot;, says. But there are not any profile perspectives which the field considers in his entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> That resulted at least in his case in his participating in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to that. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripe is so equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in his whole length that a soft crossing arises between city and green belts. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino assigns Jonás Larrazábal, which comes freely </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days of silence the authorized representative of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor from Monterrey of the process which is led against it because of probable blackmail. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> After 72 days of captivity Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is let to freely after the authorized representative of the Casino Red forgave him before the Second punishment of the district to lead the process against the brother of the mayor from Monterrey because of blackmail. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Sergio Gil García published after the assassination attempt onto the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, a row of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen that probably forces him for the payment of a sum of money so that the municipal administration approves the secret company of the bet house. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> According to the charge the prosecution opened a punishment procedure against the brother of the panistischen mayor who was arrested on the 2nd September for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimonial it became brought to the capital into the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> At this place it stayed 49 days according to a second warrant of arrest after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes because of bribery and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19th October he was transferred to the custody institution by Cadereyta, because it had bribed probable the owners of the Casino Red with one millions of pesos. On the other hand he remained only a few hours in the central security tract since there were murder threats against it. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him, at the legal proceedings as an occupant of the urban prison to participate from San Nicolás de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On 25th October a custody regulation was delivered to him by the secretary of the Second punishment of the district, Jorge Yánez. This stated that there would be sufficient proofs after the investigations lasting almost two months in order to speak for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bet house Jonás guiltily in order to be able to open this in the corresponding train. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday the authorized representative of Casino Red requested, Víctor Aldo García Gómez the judge José Luis Pecina, to remit the punishment to the brother of the mayor, for which it is put on free foot in the next hours. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the judicial hearing Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether this repaired the damage and which one of the owners of the bet house expressed his pardon. The attorney restrained the name, however. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> According to the legal matter 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is absolved. Also in the following one no objections to the process can be made, in addition no compensation is demanded. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the hearing of the authorized representative of the bet house by 15.50 o&apos;clock Larrazabal Bretón was put immediately on free foot. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza in order to inform Jonás that he was absolved and his case to the acts would be put. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> He informed him also of the judicial order for the immediate release. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details about the airplane accident in the case of which the government secretary Francisco Blake and further seven persons died. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transportation&apos;s - SCT (secretary&apos;s office for communication and transportation in Mexico) informed of the investigation results referring about the accident in the case of which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and further seven persons died to the helicopter with his whole intact structure bouncing directly against the ground without the pilot being able to have initiated an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome,Sekretär mentioned for communication and transportation that the pilot would have confirmed before the start the climatic conditions were suitable for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The facts, that height contact with trees with which the helicopter lost the trunk had the propeller blades in 25 meters, seems to refer to the helicopter having had several contact plates.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> It also declared that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, for which it met all assumptions for the transportation of the personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition he said that with the investigations on the field on which the machine had come down no helicopter parts were found. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;During the search no airplane parts were thought of other places, the impact affected the entire structure. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The helicopter was for 19 occupants built, for which it met all assumptions for the person transportation. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The field shows a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> At the time of it is major as soon as possibly to get the investigation results, however, can these several months, maybe even a year last. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Gilberto López Meyer for his part assured of, president of Aeropuertos y Servicios auxiliary (secretary&apos;s office for airplanes and auxiliary services in Mexico), that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial during the impact with travel air speed flown and had fallen the airplane on one soft slope. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information strengthens the assumption that it was a question of a normal flight operation at the moment of the strike.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference the conductor of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, counted six relevant points which should be considered at the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> View flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the flight norms it was a question of a flight to the rules of the view flight. That means that the team would have to have had sufficient view during the flight and at the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Climatic conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The AICM recorded suitable climatic conditions during the start. During the continuation towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico-state some clouds hanging deep came up. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Chosen air routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that the team had selected a lower field with better view because of the clouds towards the Cuernavaca-valley. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Strike place: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The strike coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly there were not before the strike either a control loss about the airplane or a deviation from the air route. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Spreading of the remains of the airplane in a restricted field: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information present up to the present time indicate that the helicopter had hit from straight and lateral direction. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of the scattered airplane residues make presume that the helicopter with his intact structure had hit the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No references to fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Offer the remains of the airplane at the accident place do not make either on fire or on explosion conclude. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last investigation results indicate several contact plates. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the investigations on site airplane parts were found on a height of 9200 feet above sea-level. The ground is sloping and shows a Schrägung of seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some information indicate that the helicopter could have had several contact plates. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a minute search on a field that exceeded the field shut off at the accident place no scattered airplane parts could be found, intensified something the assumption that the intact airplane structure had bounced against the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces some research protocols for the location of the gene for corpulence </seg>
<seg id="2268"> They social security institution of Mexico leads a research project for the location of the gene for corpulence with children and young people that is supported by specialists of the IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social security institution of Mexico) announced that it conducts a research project for the discovery of the gene for corpulence with children and young people under the title &quot;Genetics of the corpulence in childhood and youth&quot; with which the genetic marker in connection with predominance are supposed to be found. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López, conductor of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of medical research, emphasis biochemistry) at the clinic hospital declared to de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, that an interdisciplinary team was built up, existing from doctors, nurses, feeding specialists and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course of studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley from Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 o&apos;clock tests with children and young people are carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> It stressed that the investigation began on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the Federal state México) and is continued by Nezahualcóyolt since the 8th October on the sports ground (in the east of the Federal state México). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the objective is reached by 500 to 600 investigation persons, the study is continued on the sports ground by Independencia (in the south of the main municipal district) and finished on that by Morelos (in the north of the capital district). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> It declared the becoming acquainted of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of corpulence and the identification of factors of risk of Mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative illnesses is the objective of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the worldwide Tags of the diabetes it declared it is striven for that three thousand children and young people in the age of six to 14 years questionnaires feeding-gotten with the consent and under surveillance their parents should fill. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Also questions are asked to you about their physical activity and their familiar illness case history in order to control factors of risk which diabetes or kidney insufficiency could result in the consequence. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He exported furthermore, that on the mentioned Saturdays the investigation persons measured (Weight, size, waist extent), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood values as the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (Attempt of the identification of genes in connection with corpulence in the childhood) would become. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López stressed, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health personnel over the alarming gain of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The health inquiries from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the part of corpulent boys around 77 percent and that of the girls with corpulence increased around 47 percent. Also the Übergewichtigkeit went up dramatically&quot;, stressed the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> It indicated the search for genetic Markern is reasonable because the genetic history of the population of Mexico would be distinguished from that of other nations. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He served, that one (e) Mexican (in) on average too 65 percent more Indian-American, too 30 percent more European and to 5 percent of African origin it is what is reflected in the genes that stand with diabetes and predominance in connection. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Very generally it declared to burn the surplus of the energy taken as me (Calories) the genetics of the corpulence presses itself in the impotence from, so that this is stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher declared that would withstand direct benefits for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children with whom would be found whether these showed a degree of Übergewichtigkeit or corpulence. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the nape and at the inside arm (Akanthosis) which refer to the probability of metabolism troubles and diabetes in the Vorstadium would be examined. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information would be handled confidentially and the parents would be informed of them in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain the parents all results of measurement and suggest changes of the life-style which are adequate for the prevention of illnesses to them. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López declared there would be three basic factors which are responsible for predominance, corpulence and other chronic illnesses: To transfer movement mangle, that is missing movement in the everyday life, most time of the day before the television set and to use means of transportation, short ways on foot to go starts. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high calorie photo, that is, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger and so forth) together with a high fat and egg white photo as well as the genetics that is supposed to be analyzed in this research project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the department of chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops with polymers modified asphalts in order to make the mixture more resistant opposite climatic conditions and temperature variations </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Attention was paid to the signs that take the pavement as a basis, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City field of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the department for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured of, that when the placing and the maintenance of the asphalt coating would happen appropriated, the number of the potholes considerable reduced or even complete are avoided. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture &quot;Potholes from technical view&quot; that it held on the occasion of the International year for the chemistry he announced that the lab for which it is responsible with polymers develops modified asphalts around one the asphalt similar mixture make, that, however, a greater mechanical resistance both at high as also with low temperatures shows. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera meant, that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate should be used, as for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order to correct the behavior of the pavement and to avoid the appearance of potholes in this way. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> It declared that the asphalt - the most difficult part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon connection from which a part has a high molecular weight - the so genannten Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they lend the pavement his characteristic tough-elastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Tough-Elastic behavior of the Asphalts means, that this with high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid retains, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost firm, while he is becoming fragile with very low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;That is, that the resistance of the Asphalts is not uniform on the streets, but&quot; is &quot;changed&quot; at a day depending on the climatic conditions and temperature variations, the chemistry engineer exported. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ noticed the streets of Mexico City would have mainly a flexible pavement which consists of six material shifts from which the last three contained asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the uppermost shifts a sealing coat of asphalt lies that consists of stones small, bathed in asphalt and then hardened. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single Steinchen of this sealing coat, was swum in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles are moved on that and strengths are produced, this shift facilitates a good strength distribution in the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;If it was modified asphalt, would distribute the strengths still better&quot;, thought the chemistry engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot;About the sealing coat&quot;, he exported, &quot;a last shift is laid out, the so-called base that consists of tiny stones that is of sand that was swum also in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Since is this shift in the contact with the vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical strength than the sealing coat and it must make friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> The this pavement most strengths receives and distributed, the base in addition needs an adequate fat person and the material of which she exists must be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climatic conditions, in particular moisture and temperature variations, are wider, important factors to be considered, before all things the water&quot;, he said, &quot; because it influences the behavior of the sealing coat considerably. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the ground becomes moist, water penetrates the shift and escapes in an only difficult way again. That causes a softening of all shifts of the pavement and due to that the appearance of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a pothole arises&quot;, he said, &quot;the sealing coat is cleared away first of all while the sealing coat is being influenced only after that. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a question of a process which would have to be maintained with the first signs through adequate maintenance programs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system of Mexico) declared that the vehicle load is a further important cause for the appearance of potholes. Therefore the fat person of every shift of the pavement must always stand in relation to the vehicle load and it must be guaranteed that to avoid frequent potholes this regulation is kept to. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera referred, that still many studies on themselves could wait, for example above asphalt emulsions that are in other countries even already on the market, and with those ones the potholes simple and repair without application of high temperatures made. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What did the candidate del Valle lack in order to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that affected that that Melina Ramírez Serna got the crown of the Miss Colombia not. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives his 14th Misstitel. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again once Valle del Cauca went out emptily during the allocation of the crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to give itself in a satisfied way with that to stand on the winner podium to set a silver crown and the band that expels it as a new Miss Colombia for the show. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result preserved this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and that took Zeder onto himself, the Departamento comes already to 14 Misstitel and Melina goes along with the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in the hands. Belonging to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The great question that many ask today says: What was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a big favorite that had shown with every demonstration that she decreed above all in order to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing it had been chosen for the queen of the police and for the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received and that the crown of the Miss Colombia with home took. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> To appoint the first factor to be regarded as decisive for the decision of the jury it to the First Miss is, that they the answer to the question &quot;Of which one book influenced you most strongly and why&quot;? that had been put to her from the Carreta Literaria Leamos by Martín Murillo Gómez, not had convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the interrogator: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot I quite believe in the literature I believe, a kind is to be civilized, ultimately I believe, that the book that shaped for my childhood most strongly `The small prince&apos; is &quot;, a book going quite deeply. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the time of I read `Fault and atonement&apos;. It is a book of the universal culture which we all should read. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book, the `Leidenschaften&apos;heißt. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> An answer that bumped onto little approval firstly because of the concept zivilisieren&apos; and secondly, because it had not declared actually in which way every book named by her had influenced it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But on completion of the ceremony Melina declared to feel quiet and happy with the result: &quot;The universe is wise, it happens, which must happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people: Read please a little `The small prince&apos;. It is a splendid book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things it is said that the darling of El Valle burned out. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogotá pointed out, that the fact that she &quot;was&quot; the preferred &quot;one&quot; that collected all Beifälle and that previously had gotten all prices (Gastronomy competition Oster, public vote about the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre) that had made jealous to other candidates, which the queen that therefore could not shine on the stage stresste.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And one noticed that during their first idea in the swimsuit at the beach of the Hilton-hotel and at their two elevators during the coronation celebration. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although it surely occurred at both of them, it lacked nevertheless the strength and the swing which the representatives put from Magdalena and Atlántico for the show. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; with the channel RCN meant, that the fact that Melina was crowned the Miss, &quot;it shows that nevertheless finally the candidate that gains most prices during the competition does not become queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition Valle avoided at the end of the press - an error. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie concerning their interest in the social work which is the essential Thing of the National Beauty Competition ultimately. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It will have already his reason that two days in front of the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared they searched a woman who committed herself to the social matters of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty alone does not suffice to Colombia for a Miss. One must look over the physical thing and concentrate on the social opinion, on her having cooperated in the competition at projects already before the participation&quot; she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also speculates, that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose that one noticed of her in the stomach region had sinned. But that is inconsistent, because the jury elected her as a candidate for `natural beauty&apos; with a healthy body, good feeding habits and responsible physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that it improves that Melina did not have the best body, &quot;however their problem with the Fibrose at the stomach&quot; would give &quot;, that for me honestly said hardly was to be noticed, their dot number pressed on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos thinks the surgical interventions to which she had subjected herself were the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how she should make her be made correct. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Your body has never been their strong page, and she had to pay to this place.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this price which is awarded the first time of the National Beauty Competition a cruel forecast which should become true in the night arose after the appearance in the swimsuit. People whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to make her into the pleasure come to the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Identical, whether that is right or not, fact is that Melina enters upon their domination year from today indeed not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the possibility to represent on appointment of the National beauty competition Colombia at one of the international competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will come in as one of the queens which in spite of their overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped into the history. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> The work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano was like this </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali came in as the man who identified &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; into the history. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials plays a decisive role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On the last 4th one November a Lophoskopist went of the investigation unit of the prosecution (CTI) from Cali as the man, that the identity of the chief of the FARC confirmed (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionaries armed forces of Colombia), one: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; through comparison of the fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González Bereitschaftsdienst had, a man from Puerto Tejada that for 21 years with legal preliminary inquiries cooperates. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he had to go into the jungle frequently for five days in order to reach the place at which the corpses who it should identify were found. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 he siedelte ueber according to Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses it specialized on Lophoskopie, that is the investigation of the skin that is stopped frictions, that is the manual and feet faces. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week of the use against the so genannten Alfonso Cano it was pointed out to Eliazar to pack clothing for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something large expected it. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira according to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that it should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion that one can be that of the man that that one had routed oldest Guerrilla of the world existed. Therefore he should take along the ten finger print leaf from Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When it, however, reached with the Untersuchungste the place at which the corpse was found, it could not identify it due to his physical appearance, because this did in the least not resemble the figures which he had seen in the mass mediums. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He did not have any beard, was dressed as a farmer of the area, did not wear any glasses and was very much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifier, ink, a planting-ladle and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those ones on the print leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had seen correctly: It was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> This man coming from Puerto Tejada was the still same night responsibly for that to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to inform that it was a question of the head of the FARC in fact. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> On tracing </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali the assessment which the president Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González made on a press conference about the use against &quot;Cano&quot; become zuteil was very important. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate which can be a key factor during the solution of a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten do not identify only corpses, they support also investigations in murder and robbery things and they confirm the identity of the arrested persons. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> During their arrest many delinquents present wrong identity papers or they do not have any. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take away the fingerprints from them and search these in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told to us that it had to tear a piece of wall from a house with a theft, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this place with his hand when it pulled out a safe crammed with jewelry and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for the decrease of fingerprints. However, in this case we could take the print from the whole hand and identify the delinquent that had participated in several thefts&quot;, he remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> With the aid of the fingerprints also murder suspects can be unburdened or burdened. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently a dead man was found surrounded from liquor bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> During the determination it was presumed that a dependant could be suspect, and in fact a fingerprint agreed on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although that does not guarantee that it is a question of the murderer, nevertheless so it is related with the place at which the crime was inspected. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist of the CTI declared that &quot;the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would be taken of the object.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If they appear, she becomes a planting-ladle or she uses a band to the cash and carry. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After that the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or onto the civil status office. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers&quot;, declared the expert of the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He thought, not everything is the way it would be represented in the TV series SCI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> So as all gold is not what shines all which one tackles is not either a fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But in spite of that it can be used if one carries out a corresponding comparison. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; ones provoke the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into tents on the Zuccotti-place. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A majority complied with the clearing command and changed his location into a park seemed likely. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street provoked the authorities of New York on this Tuesday, when they attempted once again with a judicial order to enter the Manhatten-place after they had been evacuated from the place in the dawn and had attempted to fill another place at the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the Zuccotti-place onto which they wanted to provide with admission with a judicial order that allowed the &quot;Indignant&quot; one the renewed camping at this place. Meanwhile another part of the movement stuck to the clearing command and kept on filling a park to the north in the city, where it resulted in nine arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is, that, if the court does not allow us to camp on the place we us at another place find and continue the battle with legal means around the return to the Zuccotti, with sit-in the and peaceful demonstrations, mark told to Bray, one of the speakers of the movement &quot;Ocupy Wall Street&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray exported that the answer &quot;Outraged&quot; to that one onto the clearing of their tent warehouse that directly of Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered an, until before court, where the judge Lucy Billings distributed an order that forbade the violent clearing of the place and allowed the demonstrators the camping, came. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition the &quot;Indignant&quot; ones filled a new park that is completely found at the crossing of the centrally sited Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entrance into the Holland-tunnel that unites New York and New Jersey and property is the Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> You could fill the place for at least an hour. But after that the police arrived and some of the demonstrators arrested although Bray can not give any exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he saw also several journalists with handcuffs under that. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization assures hundreds of people would have arrived at this place at which also a delegation of religious leaders as signs of their support of the members of the movement and to the mediation with the police had arrived. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile the Zuccotti-place (a ground in private property) stays closedly in expectation of a judicial hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in the case of which the legality of the clearing occurred in the dawn is supposed to be analyzed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the demonstrators driven from the place bore photoprints of this judicial order with themselves and distributed it. You gave it even to some policemen that guarded the place, which resulted &quot;some small collisions&quot; in the consequence, as Bray that had indicated told some policemen would have beaten demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities, to clear members from Occupy Wall Street from the place as well as the application of &quot;Laws, who were adopted after the occupation and to forbid that the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had used already before return to the park.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg, who due to this judicial order the renewed opening of the place was canceled for the public traffic and the demonstrators, explains before the press. It pointed out to the demonstrators the city laws not allowing them to settle once again with tents and sleeping bags at this place. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The mayor defended personally the clearing of the Zuccotti-place carried out in the dawn in the case of which almost 200 persons were arrested, and which was concluded because the demonstrators &quot;offended against the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg declared it would have given the order for the clearing of the place because this itself &quot;into a place had changed, onto which the people did not come for the demonstrating, but for the breaking of the laws and in some cases, in order to cause other persons damage&quot;, because &quot;threats would have received some businesses&quot; and the residents feared &quot;for their living quality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The clearing in the dawn was disgusting and shows, that Bloomberg is interested in the reason at the protection of the finance interests and not at the protection of the interests of the North American workers&quot;, the speaker of the movement added, &quot;not to respect the freedom of the press&quot; that accused the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The persons responsible of &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; informed of their thinking about organizing &quot;great actions&quot; for the Thursday and indeed together with municipality organizations and trade unions, to commemorate around the two months that the protests now already regret since the 17th September. </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan becomes after the earthquake reborn </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The BIP increases around 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, that still always in the convalescence after the destructive earthquake that einmündete into an atomic crisis and the worst disaster, which is Japan the 2nd world war had experienced. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the property damages on 300 000 dollars, a stroke, that in spite of the difficult world economy situation, to weaken seems. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> To three quarters of permanent case the information were used for the gross domestic product of July until September for finishing this chapter at last: the BIP increased about 1.5% in comparison with the former quarter and about 6% to that onto the year of projected rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the business year begins in March 2012 - in addition means the fastest growth since the period of January until March 2010. </seg>

<seg id="2412"> In fact the enterprises increased their investments around 1.1% in comparison with the drop around 0.9% for capital investments which were noted of January until March, the first drop after six months of unstoppable rises. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In spite of that the actual change of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively from keynsianischen impulses that use the crisis, in order to establish infrastructures or to build again. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan woke up in particular thanks to the development of the domestic consumption which forms currently 60% of the Japanese BIPs. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable increased around 1%, initiated from the wachsenden expenditure on vehicles, journeys and spare-time occupations. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo confided in the home market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - into one of the &quot;refuge currencies&quot; of the investors, that before the fault crisis of the euro zone and the gloomy predictions for the USA. flee, a privilege that burdens the accounts of the export enterprises as a tombstone. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a harder currency the products are abroad more expensive, a serious problem for a country, which economy is based on the health of the tall technology producers. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota and Sony for example their weak business results of July until September led back to the notation of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> During the markets also furthermore the peripheral EU countries besieges, the government Yoshihiko Noda remains watchful. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;One must pay attention to the continuous risks, for example onto the deterioration of some foreign Ökonomien, the effects of the floods into Thailand and the fast revaluation of the yen&quot;, the undersecretary meant yesterday for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The perspectives are not real very much brightening up. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The organization for Economical Cooperation and development (OECD) declared that most member states would have shown clearer signs in September for a slow-down of the business trend. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that takes the turning points of the world economy brought onto the light, that with the greatest economic powers the brake would have moved. </seg>

<seg id="2429"> With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries pushed up and themselves insecurity making wide Greece gets lost also further in the labyrinth, that from the great European fault crisis leads out. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek temporary government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political strengths is proved slowly by facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, was referring yesterday to there not being any alternatives to the structure reforms and the a hundred days fixed with his appointment being possibly too shortly for their conversion, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis of Samaras, assured that it will support the new economy measures and not take back his demand of new choices for the planned date, the 19th February, under any circumstances. </seg>

<seg id="2446"> The peak above Kleinstkredite is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for the impulse &quot;two fundamental objectives&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> The queen declared people strive for until end of the year of 2015 175 million poor families being supposed to have access to these finance services and ten million of these budgets crossing the poverty border. </seg>

<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but it continued in the fall, in particular around that activist it suffices to achieve, that the government politics with regard to the Greeks today and possibly of Italy tomorrow than to assess too laxly. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The premiership request of the European Commission suggested by the executive committee was accepted almost one-consistently. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Among 1001 delegatees only nine had voted against that, ten had abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The Standing ovation several minutes continuous that due to their intervention decrees Angela Merkel as well as some hours meant for Wolfgang Schäuble later first of all lieβen on the part of the three Europe-inclined Ministers of Finance of no doubts open. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of the chancellor supports - in the same way as that one Offer - following slogan: the answer to the crisis lautet&quot;nicht less, but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only, because Europe means peace, but also da&quot;neun millions of jobs directly of the euro are dependent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Ist&quot;die time for a breakthrough come&quot; for the chancellor in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could be expressed in the euro zone through a modification of the Lisboan contract with regard to the budget politics of the countries confirming the control of the European Union; in the same way this, however, could lend&quot; in the choice of the president of the European Commission on basis general voice delivery münden&quot;,um Europe a face. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> This is, however, in any case one of the request proposals adopted by the congress to which Wolfgang Schäuble godfather stood unequivocally. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly the 47 of them are only little likely to agree rapidly on this revolution: Groβ-Britannien is stands the thing refusingly opposite, and the leading ones of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is to know. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The milestone is, however, put. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> In the same way the delegatees refused the proposal of the weighting of every country in an overwhelming majority in the EZB executive board according to the weighting of the single Ökonomien, which would bring a strengthening of the position of Germany with themselves obviously. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> The chancellor, concerned about smoothing of the climate within their party, intensified therefore the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She did not attempt, however, more, their congress at the expense of der&quot;kleinen&quot; or the in trouble contained European countries win, that would criticize the arrogant Germany immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> So far the Europe request of the importance der&quot;deutsch-French friendship&quot; a section dedicates, Angela Merkel Frankreich does not call onto the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not direct. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because this reminds of Leipzig two centuries ago standing in the center of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Actual one of the defeats of the Napoleonic army humiliating most at the very top. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What does the fraud represent with sick announcements? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> According to the family allowances UMP and government tackle the sick announcements now. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy arrives on Tuesday, the 15th November in Bordeaux, to consult around a family allowance cash and a speech about that - already since 2007 always turning round again - to express topic of the fight from the state against social fraud as well as economical dependence. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> In order to accompany this attack that goes out of the aim to subject the economy in a hardness test, on the other hand, however, herald of an axis of the right premiership campaign does not represent less, the majority wants to concentrate on employee suffering-announcements. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> At first with budget-economical objective: the government aims for the introduction of a fourth Karenztages for consideration of a sick announcement with employees in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> On good German means this, that a sick employee without approval of the specific company would lose the wage of four days, thus therefore at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A Maβnahme that according to the Tageszeitung&quot;Les&quot; Anger threatens &quot;reverberations&quot; to cause, to insert 280 million euros, however would help. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that with another Maβnahme of rather symbolic character would go einher: to arrange the civil servants an uncompensated Karenztag in the illness case (up to now there is not any qualifying period for them, in the contrast to the three Karenztagen in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Stand meanwhile these questions at what the abuse combined with Arbeitsabsenz is aimed at this time in the discussion, the majority provokes the fraud subject also anew. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Controls will be considerably more important, and in addition these are to refund if this is demanded&quot; warned Xavier praying-edge on Sunday, the 13th November, before the microphone of the sender RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As also in other cases the effects of this announcement seem a little bit out of proportion with regard to the reality from fraudulent actions in the field of the sick announcements. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is in fact already since 2002 object of permanent observation as well as political offensives which most frequently bore fruits. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not more frequently sick elsewhere in Europe than persons are. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Let&apos;s stay, however, at first with the national digits. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the country health insurance CNAM more than 237 million euros of day compensations were paid in the year 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Gemäβ of the economic research and documentation institute of the health service represented the day compensations in the year 2008 with 11.3 billion euros 5% of the health editions. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount 46% fell concerning concerning motherhood vacation as well as accidents at work and 54% illness vacation, that heiβt 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And accordingly 2.5% of health editions. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In the year 2010 only 14.5 sick person days the French were entitled opposite the 17.8 days in the year 2009 according to a study of the Alma Consulting group on the average. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average which hushes up certain differences: another, in the year 2007 of Monster.com, web site for career planning, was published, it showed that 75% of the 40th 000 consulted, French employees declared not to have taken any single sick person day. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another, study this time understood from the health insurance explains that 37% of the sick announcements were in the year 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above that. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with their European neighbors the French employees tend therefore not more than elsewhere to disability. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One in the year 2010 of two researchers of the French, state center&apos;s for science research (CNRS) led long-term study showed, that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (illness- or in another way establishes) oscillated, and indeed in France between 10% and 11% towards 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud with sick announcements sets one disappearing small part with regard to the illicit work dar. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Concerning the fraud only a weak Ausmaβ is reached here. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The Bestärkung of the legislation since in 2002 it brings with themselves that there are systmatische controls with sick announcements that exceed 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In the year 2008 the CNAM found (public college for Aus- and further education of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized ones, short-term sick announcements, that heiβt in 37,050 Fällen&quot;,ungerechtfertigt or too long&quot; were. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the systematically controlled sick announcement cases of more than 45 days of duration one counted 11% of an&quot;unangepassten under 1.2 million or unjustified&quot; Fell, the heiβt 132.000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total this does therefore 169.000&quot;ungerechtfertigte&quot; Fells onto several millions of employees that asserted a sick announcement. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A digit which represents only a weak Ausmaβ opposite for example that one of the illicit work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP representative Dominique Tian, author of a feature appeared in July with regard to this question, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss of earnings per annum, that is more than the total costs at day compensations, and thus considerably more than those ones defraudation at last-named. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Daddy demos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece has a new emulation necessarily for the interception of his economics. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This had on Monday that announces 14 November of the prime ministers Lucas to daddy demos before the parliament under add of the fact that the a hundred days granted to his government on the part of the union did not suffice in order to finish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;In order to be able to continue the endeavours towards a strengthening of the economy, we need support of our European partners as well as a new program for the budget adaptation&quot;, declared the head of the government in his first public speech at the Eröffung of the debate about the vote of confidence of the parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The conversion of the decisions made on the occasion of the euro summit conference on 27th October is die&quot;Hauptaufgabe&quot; of the new government, &quot;there the collaboration of the country within the Eurozone&quot;auf the game&quot; would stand as he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Correspondingly planned to M. daddy demos, the state deficit of the Landes&quot;um the 9%&quot; of the gross domestic product of today to at the end of the year to lower, after this in the year 2010 10.6% and in the year 2009 at 15.7% lay. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The rights leans the new Sparmaβnahmen from </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis of Samaras, head of the right wing, had given on Monday his approval of attempt serving the escape to the already approved Maβnahmen with regard to one from the fault crisis, mentioned it beforehand, however, that his party would become not readily for an additional Sparmaβnahme erkären. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote for the benefit of new Maβnahmen&quot;, he said on the occasion of a representative meeting of his party New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> It had declared itself readily with the handicaps of the reduction of budget deficit and debts, in the same way as for the fight against the waste, faced, however, any politics that would stop the economic upswing hostilely. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Olli Rehn, EU-Kommisar entrusted with economic and currency drinking-gifts that had prevented that IWF and EU do not release the necessary loan over 8 billion euros without written guarantee of all parties above their support of the planned Maβnahmen had answered to Antonio Samaras, that his word suffices and would not sign anything under pressure of Auβen. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, according to an expert committee </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in refusal of the death, as follows from a report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The committee declared, that governments cooperated, institutions of the health care and doctors with regard to analgesic treatment around the best analgesic means ready to set, and this also about the cancer cases exceeding. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude opposite the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of the Canadians accept in fact on that to speak with their doctor about conditions among which they would like to die and hit dispositions for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society by Canada, at which six experts were shared, which are associated with each other on different fields, among other things ethic, right and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends the government to change the criminal law in such a way around suicide and euthanasia accompanied allow, where this choice positions itself, and indeed with patients, that than to be looked at in the situation to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude the experts quote a recently published inquiry of the independent society EIU which had compared the death quality with each other in 40 countries of the globe of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada positioned itself at that on the 10th rank, the study notices that &quot;the medical dying-care in Canada produced a culture in which the people are afraid to touch the topic death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians do not have any access to analgesic means, so the experts sent for from the Royal Society of Canada tell to us. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And in spite of the wish of the Canadians of the majority, to die at home, so die, however, finally 68.6% of these in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> The rate with 86% is here considered by the entire country at dying-cases kicked in in the hospital in the Quebec most highly. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the tricky question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide the authors of the report come to conclusions, the the position of the federal government that already geäuβert has of no changes of the criminal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide want to carry out, opposite are. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Now, however, there is according to the experts, have inspected the gleichermaβen ones all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and accompanied suicide legalizes or have entkriminalisiert, no evidence, that such decriminalization Miβbräuche in those one application, therefore the practice realization of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or not agreeing persons after themselves would pull. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary one encounters considerably more case of such infringements just in the countries, in which euthanasia and are legalized accompanied suicide not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is unequivocally illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although here unequivocal illegal&quot;, Jocelyn Downie declares. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians approve the euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let&apos;s Vergegenwärtigen ourselves that themselves had according to an Angus-Reid-inquiry carried out in the year 2010 already 85% of the Canadians for the benefit of the euthanasia geäuβert since they think this allows persons at the end of their life to moderate their sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And believe 66%, that the facts of a legalization of the euthanasia has negotiated not for the consequence the message that the life of older or handicapped people less value besäβe. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> With regard to the persons, that have practised already an accompanied suicide, the interviewees to 41% represent the opinion that these should not be pursued legally. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> Situation represents itself what affects maintaining or attitude of the means with patients as less clear, according to the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> In the same way these advise in their recommendation list that in the criminal law it is supposed to be indicated that the settling of the means for which there was a valid refusal is not supposed to be regarded as criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The expert committee in addition demands that specialists of the health service should be trained in the task of having to fear a settling of the means at the life end to respect, and this without legal pursuit. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The committee declared, that governments cooperated, in order to set the best analgesic means readily, institutions of the health care and doctors with regard to analgesic treatment and this also about the cancer cases exceeding. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally the committee demands physical pains with regard to the means already in the Canadian institutions for the health care comprehensively used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take these into consideration at least since these served little as the euthanasia to that in the same way reduce and these itself onto the same procedures would refer. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reservations of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts on the right field of the health service expressed already reservations from Canada with regard to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, the attitude of the report-signing experts has among other things als&quot;extrem&quot; describes since this of the euthanasia practice sets with sick people in the final phase of any borders. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the gates for a situation, in which every to whom than 18 years it is world-weary and older to ask another person for being helpful to his suicide to him&quot;, so RA Deschamps, that yesterday had checked a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report splint to put the direct responsibility of the individual about all other values that are shared to the society in the social knit fabric. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Now however, so he says, would give es&quot;Leitlinien and obligations in a society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, expressed strong resistance&quot; opposite the conclusions of the report &quot;to ebenfalls&quot;einen&quot;, who&quot; called &quot;her als&quot;Pro euthanasia manifesto&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who even member is to the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report information concerning the nonpresence of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and are legalized accompanied suicide, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy politics: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts should triumph over dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> A topic exists, that on basis of short-term considerations or due to emotions must not be handled, so this is certainly the energy politics. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and costs of the electricity influence the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of the enterprises in direct Maβe. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take a choice meeting as the reason to think about this topic as well as about the position of the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will bear only then fruits when she probes the entirety of economical, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data found. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution drives forward a doubling of the electricity demand up to the year 2050, if an enormous part of the world population is not supposed to have to renounce a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Simultaneously one must moderate the shortage of the fossil resources in order to keep on being able to produce electricity continuously without forgetting the compelling necessity for the decrease of the hothouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Kept on being isolated therefore blebt Germany in his decision to renounce nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> Neither this is not the case in Belgium, which subjects his decision of the necessity to find a substitution-capable replacement source, in the Switzerland which once just intends only still to build nuclear power plants of the last generation yet. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Groβbritannien, Finland, poles, the Czech Republic, that Netherlands, Swedes, South Africa, China, India and Brazil in order to name only some states on the other hand their projects keep on pursuing with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States decided for her part according to Fukushima on attaching a further unit to their park in their taking the work Three Mile Island deactivated after the nuclear accident once again in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Also when the onto renewable sources of energy achieved, German model sometimes than model is put down, so the reality contradicts, however, the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice in Berlin knocks down in the form of a rise in price of the electricity price, an energetic dependence intensified by the increased resort to import gas in particular on Russia, a rise that through gas and coal power stations of caused CO2 emissions. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The entirety of these joyless effects will become noticeable already within few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case Denmark gives reason to the contemplation. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is on the one hand European table leader with regard to wind energy from which it gets 30% of his electricity, on the other hand the country is, alternately used with wind energy, to one of the strongest users of coal and gas; aufgrunddessen his CO2 outputs as well as his electricity price are each about 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European mean. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the permanence of our energy politics our neighbors pay one unlike our French budgets around 40% of higher electricity bill. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Since the energy price represents a decisive role of the competitiveness as well as a stability pledge of the industry on national ground in the globalisierten economy, the französichen enterprises have an advantage due to the most favorable electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Every significant reduction concerning the nuclear power would involve therefore a strong growth of the energy price, which would make become the noble statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power for the illusion. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Inquiries showed that that one is a price that to pay the groβe majority of the French in the same way little is ready as recognize it resistance to the principle of this source of energy makes. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We Vergegenwärtigen ourselves that the energy politics of our country facilitated it a branch of industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs build up. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Due to their strong export character it brings a vast quantity of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises onto the international markets and this turns into creator of innumerable jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> France should understand the decision to get out of the nuclear power, so a Groβteil would fall victim to that to this KMU, and the annual 6 billion euros onto capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which electrician would charge an EPR designed for the functioning onto sixty years if the downfall of his producer is programmed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Around the energetic equation one must grant to solve, that it just as little one as a devil work gives a miracle means for the production of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The solutions developed by the company Areva, CO2-poor to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the Komplementarität of the sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> To receive the highest possible security level uprightly is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a law enforcement agency which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in already existing works as for example at the construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their teams who made themselves a name due to their professionalism are just too proprietary from the security idea. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years the nuclear industry experienced three fatal breakdowns. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only an only, and indeed in Three Mile Island, kicked in under normal operating conditions; so it went by without consequences for human being and environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl the drama was caused by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of extent from two natural catastrophes never been was caused that the death of several ten thousand people caused. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw their lessons just the same from this accident as she had done this after the two preceded ones. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation of the law enforcement agencies of the French and German operators and constructing engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that makes resistance for him possible opposite such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Since it is taken as desirable among the electrotechnicians to build a nuclear power plant, so a construction stop would be a fabulous present in Flamanville onto the competition of Areva and EDF, when one would let them free railways, to tear the leadership position onto himself in the inevitable nuclear power development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is unavoidable and legitimate to search for the best energy bouquet for our country, however, it would be irresponsible to make emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber who determines just as economical, social and financial situation of our country dominate a debate. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration load or chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration politics led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many kinds of angles - overloading of police, court and administration organs due to a politics subjected to the numbers, compatibility of this politics with the status of a &quot;country of the human rights&quot;, as France itself had called itself. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently the molestation of official page directed towards foreign students had shaped the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior usually had (see Libération of the 23rd May) announces that Frankreich&quot;keine has talents, bricklayers or waiters from the exterior necessarily&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this politics was analyzed only rarely from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> A comprehensive consensus dominates this topic indeed between rights and left wingers. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> From right page the clay was changed by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976, dass&quot;900.000 unemployed persons, under that&quot; more than 2 million immigrated workers &quot;, no problem for a country might represent&quot;, not &quot;pick up&quot; from left page through Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, Frankreich&quot;könne the entire poverty of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> Only difference consists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of the invasion of the national ground through hordes of Polish plumbers was divided into the year 2005 both of the right and of the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> From both warehouses the immigrants were perceived as a load for the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference consists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit, that one is opposite the immigrants admit willing. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande restricts himself in his program on banalities that refer to that cooperative development allows it unsere&quot;Migrationsprobleme&quot; solve. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a load, as a problem, can affect the choices possibly; however, it is economically expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> How us the economic experts Ian Goldin and vergegenwärtigen to Geoffrey Cameron in a recently appeared work, which summarizes the newest findings concerning the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our future tenses, May 2011, of Princeton University Press, 352 S.), a wide consensus exists among the specialists with regard to the positive influence of the immigrant flood onto economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restricting the immigration would invalidate the growth and damage the labor market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The native workers base the apprehensions opposite the influence of the migrants on the idea that these threaten, in particular that one small qualified to substitute when they exerted pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The experience shows, however, that the immigrants in truth are considerably more complementary than as the native wage workers since they schwerpunktmäβig carry out professions in sectors that are unausgelastet job-technically. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The immigrants in a small way qualified work in sectors which annoy native wage workers little, the more qualified ones among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the training is not adjusted to the work offer. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive wage effect </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way as a surgeon would have difficulties, to work in a country in which there is a lack of anesthetists so this Komplementarität causes a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs onto wages and internal labor market situation also between locals and migrants. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri calculated in this way, that a 1%-iger causes rise of the immigrant flood an included, long-term rise of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And these without consideration of the fact, that the variety brought in by the immigrants is the idea creation as well as the economic growth zuträglich (high part of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants contribute also net to the employee benefit systems, in the European countries on average about in a height of 1% of the general budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The world work organization estimates for example, that a person immigrating from 30 years in the age to Germany brings in the public budget on average about his lifetime a net contribution (Gains minus editions) of around the 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted the missing Schnittpunkte&quot;mit to starting of his mandate the teeth&quot; cause. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These said teeth which should deter the immigrants achieved, however, the contrary effect exactly. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented the democracy, now it remains to think over the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember even that, who had been able to pass the entire 20th century to their invention in the Athens more than two thousand years ago about the tragedies of the First world war, the totalitarianism, the holocaust, Gulag, however, of also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece above themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some had believed presumably, it suffices to exercise the right to vote and indeed in most directly possible way, in order to see the democracy prevailing over their enemies once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> One knows since Napoleon&quot;dem small&quot; that it was a question of a feature of the state of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general right to vote that represents necessary condition of the democracy is condition not sufficient for that and can become zum&quot;Unterdrückungsinstrument just as well&quot;, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot squeezed it out then. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires more by far: a public room, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the powers, a training, clarification, economical and social esprit de corps, a jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe in which we are is a depression, but she is just as much and most first of all a political and democracy crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The mind change of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums would have had twice informative character in this respect: once that of the necessity of a forceful return of the politics, on the other hand, however, also that one of the worrying feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be taken as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight were migrated today and that the republican soldiers, or most of those of them, not aim more into the correct direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We do not have to extract anything in order to insist on a success of the internal referendum which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in turned precedence. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free appearance for the European autocrat or a jump with joined eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: A groβartige choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from full right, clarified and constant, a choice and democracy, this time on European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are not any crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know by the way already anymore where to end the enumeration - since there is only a single crisis, and this rules in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is completely Europe, which submits to the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies which suffers from his powerlessness and his solidarity lack. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is completely Europe, which is humiliated on international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> One is worried about sovereignty transfers in direction Europe - it is completely in this case Europe, which loses his sovereignty by degrees, and in this way each of the nations attached to him. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The priority consists in that, the nation sovereignty the leadership of the European project back onto the hand give. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it was due to the entirety, whether the Europeans reduce the load of their debts, free themselves from the markets and can initiate a future through investments. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Definitely the exit from the crisis has to lead decisions on European level to the condition that can not be felled without total demokratische Rechtmäβigkeit without us into the ruin. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal of Jacques Delors and the socialists was combated long time over, everyone insists today the European economic leadership on that. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> A renewed Torheit and a further dead end would be to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it vorschwebt to the citizens -, however. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new stage of European construction onto ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In order to make in France the republic arise, one needed the fact, &quot;create&quot; republicans too. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of the interests alone could achieve here not suffices. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction keeps on remaining valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must form a Europe on economical level better integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved, when one one seen political more democratic Europe creates, a truly European nation sovereignty. </seg>

<seg id="2772"> Chip cards &quot;without contact&quot; become the common property </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The world fair for chip cards opens their gates for Paris near at the Tuesday in Villepinte in optimistic attitude. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 should end according to Eurosmart from microprocessor chips (Ec cards, SIM-Karten-Telefon) actually with a 11%-igen increase of worldwide sales, with more than 6 billion sold units. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The tragendste segment is at that the technology without contact which facilitates payments in public means of transportation or settlement of purchases when one very simply holds the card onto a reading device. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Opposite the a year before sold 320 million 460 million chip cards without contact should be sold this year worldwide! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Your share of the market should increase in the year 2012 still further (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe gains ground with regard to the payment without contact after it hinterhergehinkt long During the region Asien-Pazifik. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million visa-cards are endowed with this functionality already, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France the beginnings are rather modest: Only 400,000 visa cards without contact were spread. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The consumer markets make, however, steam. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour emitted therefore this year 2.5 millions passport MasterCards without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> In order to proceed with higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks equip their customers with these cards. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two groβe French finance institutes committed themselves to giving bank cards that are equipped with chip without contact&quot; &quot;to their customers in future systematically&quot;, Gérard Nébouy quits, president of visas Europe France at. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment by mobile </seg>
<seg id="2786"> That is, however, only a first stage on the way for the means of payment of the future: to the mobile telephone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> One disappearing small percentage at devices is endowed with the NFC technology necessary for the realization of these transactions (Near Field Communication) up to now. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;You are behind guessed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they should find out at least next year a real upward development.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We reckon in the year 2012 the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide&quot;, declares Marc Bertin, chairperson of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen which will end of December until next June. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are supposed to be equipped with a capsule which approves payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE practices a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>

<seg id="2796"> Terrorist front gets on, of Sahara to Nigeria </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is about the relationships between al-Qaida worried in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The already long under suspicion standing relationships between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem confirm. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday the Algerian Vize-Auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers attained darüber&quot;Gewissheit now&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The kind and manner, with which both organizations go ahead onto a clear cooperation as soon as the relationships of the secret services point there&quot;, he declared without keeping on going into the detail. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to do a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Interfaces to light supported the investigations about the kidnapping of two French in the Niger occurred in last January. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> The Antoine de Léocour kidnapped by supporters of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey and Vincent Delory should be on the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers on the occasion of an operation carried out through the French special units getöten. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> French and Nigerian observers want to have thought in the ruins of the field several telephone chips which belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the led calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, in the Niger as well as in Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to radio France Internationale (RFI) the observers interest in particular the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian, that long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram had delayed; the other one leads to a man, which is on its way as the Aqmi and the sect standing is valid. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is a progress, one must wait, however, for undoubtedly more unequivocal proofs before one can speak of a functional cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;It is, however, conceivable&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;One knows for years that financial and intellectual support of Auβen covers the champagnes and that this shows herself increasingly actively&quot; the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo reduces. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In these last months diese&quot;Unterstützungsleistungen&quot; in their course &quot;became&quot; increasingly more obvious, in the same way the addresses as well as the operation modes of Boko Harem, that now onto the calling in of suicide assassins as well as the use of always complex becoming explosives indicate, that bear the same handwriting as those ones that were used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The International Community in order to begin near Washington has carried out since this time pressure on Abuja so that one takes into account there for the problems caused through Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities long considered the grouping in fact as a community of Illuminaten to whom no special attention has to be given time over. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Fast success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> The Boko Haram set up in the year 2002 in Maiduguri in surroundings of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - what means so much in Haoussa wie&quot;die western education is a disgrace -&quot; the establishment of an Islamic emirate pursues in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this destitute region the alliance finds out rapid successes. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It politicizes and demands strict compliance of the sharia while the activists attached to her are fighting against the godless central government in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The activists have first of all churches, bars and authorities in the visor. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009 the activists of Boko Haram with their increasing attacks against the commissioner&apos;s offices showed themselves especially actively. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction on the part of Abuja is however as usually indifferenziert. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> The Mohammed Yusuf taken into captivity is killed in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Due to that the sect becomes rapidly more radical and leaves their strongholds in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> She confessed herself last Christmas then for an assassination attempt in Jos which claimed 80 human lives to another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June the fault of a suicide assassination attempt that happened in the safeguarded police headquarters in Abuja is assigned to Boko Haram - the first of his kind. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August the local seat of the United Nations gets to the major international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The education of a terrorist axis in Africa, that of Mauritania above Nigeria until there to Somalia is supposed to lead, worries since then all security experts. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> A crisis-weakened America keeps up a complex world simple, in order not to say: simple ideas lead? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> If one listens to the republican premiership candidates so, the voters could get almost this impression. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For some days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their combatants are letting their thundering declarations as well as their statements concerning the Auβenpolitik, traditional republican emphasis, repeatedly verlautbaren. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> About China, Iran and the Israel help fall - underpinned frequently in keinster manner - slogans. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> The Mitt Romney standing highest with regard to the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; in the course tended to summon the Chinese before the WTO and they der&quot;Währungsmanipulation - leading topic in an America, that through the migration of entire branches of industry to Asia onto the Äuβerste is stimulated -&quot; accuse. </seg>

<seg id="2839"> He had called for a solid, but constructive conversation exchange with Peking (also the current attitude Obamas). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman is not heard since it stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Reagan&apos;s image </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney had praised also military strokes against Iran if the sanctions to the Stoppung of the nuclear program should fail. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, I stop Iran&quot; it had sounded. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is wiedergewählt, they get the bomb&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> North stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas conduit north stream, that goes by on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly with Russia, sat down in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It is supposed to supply gas for an equivalent from 30 million budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to inspect this event with shine and Gloria. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 invited guests, under that four State- and heads of the government have attended, last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under Orchesterbeschallung and with gourmand buffet of the opening of the new gas conduit that unites Russia and Germany below sea-level directly with each other north stream. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medwedew, the French prime minister François Fillon as well as his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands turned symbolischerweise together the steering wheel of the valve which carries the Russian gas to the west-European net. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new gas conduit Western Europe is supposed to be delivered by a first pipeline 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per annum from 1,224 km according to length that connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipeline, the one package of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allows, is supposed to be finished at the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And one makes already the contingency of the construction of a third management on same stretch be heard. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom the punctual and point-exact finishing of this enormous construction as a victory works. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The north stream pipeline will facilitate a direct gas delivery same to Germany, and indeed under avoidance of any route course through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country road. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: For them it becomes now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia when they threaten to close the admission to west-European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, had not zurückgescheut before comparing the north stream pipeline with a &quot;new deutsch-sowietischen pact&quot; in connection at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in the year 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the topic is politically seenly äuβerst sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe gained an even higher supply security through the advocation of this Russian project. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> This, however, energy European at the expense of a weakening, since the project beat a breach between west and east Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia did not finish it in hardly five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, that show strong gas consumption and their gas occurrences for the end go, to put through. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas conduit is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that unites us in organic way&quot; confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the gas conduit when it referred to that in which degree the groβen gas contracts also of political and economical page are important. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this declares the wide smile of the Gazprom managers in Lubmin numerously represented with regard to the gas inlet. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas conduit is also an exceptional technique. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater management consists of steel with concrete coating which is supposed to protect her against anchors. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the seabed, in about 200 m of depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Near their construction dating mine fields had to be avoided from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;About hundreds of mines had &quot;to become&quot; as a precaution away or destroyed&quot;, Jens gave miller, speaker of the society north stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Increasing Maβnahmen to the protection of the fauna and flora had to be caught to Auβerdem. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The management is a long snake of metal, heavily as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither through valves, still maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, however, the project persons responsible refrained from that since the Swedes were keen on seeing a Russian state society settling on height of their coasts in permanent way to little. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the case of an average we close the gas passage in less than one minute&quot;, Müller specified Jens. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the case of a leakage that escapes in the gas conduit contained gas therefore into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is regarded as only little probable, however, by the constructing engineers, there the Schweiβnähte onto a permanence of a leakage per 100,000 years was estimated. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The state supervision of the gas conduit is guaranteed by an underwater robot that is operated to external observation purposes from a sea-going vessel both as also of a device that circulates in the interior of the gas conduit. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the form of a cigar, miβt a meter of diameters, is introduced in the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three complete days of the moving through the management with a speed of 3 meters per second, the device supplies with his arrival most exact information about possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas conduit was designed in order to function for fifty years without having to be subjected also to only the least repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gas circulation is very simply guaranteed through pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This is in 200 cash at the Admission-, 100 cash at the exit place. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five societies united their strengths for the realization of this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The wiring stays, however, in the hand of Gazprom which holds 51% of the parts. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The German societies E. ON and BASF keep on being attached here (each to 15.5%), in the same way as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group of GDF Suez (each to 9%). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five societies formed an enterprise community that north is mentioned stream and that is charged the construction as well as company of the gas conduit. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has their seat in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is especially favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom let out then the entire capacity of their gas transportation to this society, and indeed onto verlängerbaren twenty year contract. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless as groβ that one in a real way transports gas amount turns out&quot;, specified Jens millers. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the gas conduit construction was protected to 30% of stockholders as well as to 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The entire labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez the amount to be invested was for example 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The minority stockholders are, however, gewiβ, to bring in their expenses again since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas conduit is revealed at a coastal strip sandy, wooded with pines at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas escape gate. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further identification numbers of the arriving gas before this is seen into the German gas conduits. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour passing by. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity these would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 million in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskins, a brand notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> About fifteen years ago started up by an Italian enterprise, Moleskine would like to give now again new style to the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> An atmosphere of adventure has, at candle appearance hours spent with the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook of Moleskine is slightly again recognizable, with his black, rectangular cover, his elastic band, the off white pages, as over the time there old. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> That moleskins notebook is, as one knows it today arisen, however, in the year 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian enterprise Modo Modo which has his seat in Milan decided on launching a distinguished design notebook at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then compartment adviser of the enterprise, is charged the market launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook was mentioned from a traditional production technique, Mole Skin (Mole skin) inspires, that describes a Baumwollack that for example is used for purchases of upholstered seats. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This kind of notebook was very in demand among writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine made an old and almost forgotten object which was regarded as icons of avant-garde artists until the 20th century revive again&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand person responsible, with Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success sets in. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> In between 2006 and 2010 the sales increase around 26% and establish themselves with a sale of 12.7 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskins passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, and indeed of France up to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to make a composite drawing of the buyers since the notebook inspires businessmen just the same as also students and specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-intellectual customers. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small, Italian enterprise which counted 12 employees in his beginnings employs today more than 100 employees and decrees since 2008 more than two offices; one in Milan, the other one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> The enterprise markets his notebooks into bookshops, on web portals as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and knows about putting through his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the spirit of the time and his new write need which exists in spite of the upswing of the E-Mails&quot;, declared Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural feature is accompanied of the development of the company moleskins: Recently the brand has an exposure by the name of &quot;Detour (Detour)&quot; launch, in which architects and artists made out their own notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August the enterprise launched also a cover with leopard pattern on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine profited by his success and this cultural spirit of the time and understood to diversifizieren his products: Bags, diaries, chargers, computer wrappers... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success, the envier onto the plan brings: In the fall 2006 Modo Modo of the investment ground SG Capital Europe the present Syntegra Capital was bought up, and a new chapter hit in this way in the history of the company moleskins. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why does the unemployment rate of handicapped employees remain on so high level? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of the handicapped persons are in search of a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today die&quot;15 begins. Week of the work for disabled persons&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> In spite of an objective-conscious public politics which was introduced in the year 2005 the unemployment rate is always twice as high with handicapped persons as the average average is: 19% towards 9% of Arbeitlosigkeit of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;Refusal&quot;, so emphatically Éric Blanchet, president of the union Adapt which adjusts the &quot;week of the work for disabled persons&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress achieved within fifteen years is considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;Then the unemployment rate was so high not twice, but three times.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Nonetheless it remains to do a lot still enormously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said, however, that for handicapped unemployed persons numerous obstacles keep on living on before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More frequently it affects the older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average) are. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> You have a small qualification level: 80% of them do not have any school-leaving examination and there are only 10,000 disabled persons under the 2.3 million students with higher education end. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Also the long-term unemployment is End-Final very much widespread: 53% with the disabled persons opposite 38% in the total cut. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In a word there are so many criteria that complicate a renewed work entrance, and that &quot;form&quot; the &quot;core of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, president of Tremplin, a union founded in 1992 that in this case it is helpful to enterprises to recruit handicapped employees. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much to the objective brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Stays the unspoken, the states of mind, that indeed certain, nevertheless develop, however, slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study carried out by the union IMS-Entreprendre in April for the magazine La Cité indicated the consulted managers have &quot;a weak knowledge level concerning disabled persons&quot; that &quot;ueberrepraesentiert&quot; is &quot;from persons in rotation chairs, psychologically or intellectually inferior-well-to-do&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees have another wide way for themselves around the employment aim of employee hindered from 6% that was stipulated by 1987 in a law of achieving. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> These numbers last-named, coming from the year 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now at around the 3%&quot;, Pierre Blanc, president of Agefiph, the organization that it is charged that to drive in contributions from enterprises that disregard this law, tells. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The evidence: Firms&apos; &quot;paying the Zahl&quot;Gebühren&quot; has just as as the sum of the amounts between 2007 and 2011 paid in reduces, and zahlenmäβig indeed of 59,000 on 46,000 (and of 606 on 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, which contribution increases designates, got a strong pressure onto the enterprises, declared Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement expresses also a real discovery in particular with the groβen company groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the ministry for work only 59% of the firms employ between 20 and 49 employees handicapped employees, enterprise with 100 to 199 employees on the other hand 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard:&quot;Was for a luck&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Already before they offered the forehead to den&quot;Blauen Tuesday evenings (20:45 o&apos;clock), Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure that brought them the friendly game from Eden. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It would be too far caught to say there was a secret consent between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Page at page on the spectator podium of the Stade de France sitting would be able to have closed George Leekens and Eden Hazard well and gladly peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months to the lively gesture of his striker against Turkey the Belgian national coach had not received anything as praise concerning his person. </seg>
