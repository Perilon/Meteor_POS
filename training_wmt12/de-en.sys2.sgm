<seg id="101"> &quot;What prefer Czech children between 12 and 15, in terms of food, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favourite foods were many mehlspeisen, fleischgerichte cards and, of course, süßspeisen. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &apos;alarming&apos; is the great popularity of sweet water soft drinks, the final report on the survey said. </seg>

<seg id="110"> The children kreuzten in questionnaire far more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less knödel or sweet foods. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Experts say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the initial article about how stylisten learning, I had a bit of a gemeckert, that was a bit too much material for the start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> As ahnte I do not in the least, and more. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the &quot;runs on the square.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is even worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer the review is to stand as more information and practical challenges before us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course every samstags and Sunday takes place, it is fully documented. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time, we debated with Director Alena as part of the course is not a single man, as it attracts a woman, who has not ideal proportionierte figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And there are still the most of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Those who have a short neck, the other a to jungenhafte figure without proper graphs and others are mollig. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is the stylisten to conceal broad shoulders look to extend the neck or the necessary graphs hervorzuzaubern. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We also got tips on how to frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great busen, a hip and narrow their function and attracts figurbetont, without being too provocative acts. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between their and hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers really not fit, should be at least a little after level schneidern. </seg>
<seg id="124"> You will not regret it, because good sedentary clothing is simply unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailored skirt you feel much better, than in a book, The endlessly highs and verrutscht, in their absteht, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Jungenhafte characters can in turn allow clothing with wrinkles up applications, stickereien or raffung. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In this lot of information and I am glad that I have a whole week figurtypen time to go through the head, I have everything thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet, I fear that in the face of the piece of aufgetragenen homework is almost impossible to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kursteilnehmerinnen, namely a promi allocated for you to devise suitable outfits - tagesbekleidung and abendrobe. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We should the current appearance, the modestil of its stars and take its figurtyp. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I should attract Miranda Kerr ,&quot;&quot; which you may know from the Victoria&apos;s Secret campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Inside, because it is much better for me personally, I juble than, for example Britney Spears or attract Christina Aguilera, has increased in the last time in the hundred kilograms of - well, that is a bit excessive, or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes should we look for magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, ausdrucken and then grafisch work. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In &quot;moodboard,&quot; then how all this result is called, is our personal style and expressing our relationship to the grafischen design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is also very important to reflect on the graphic side of the stylings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The models of the stylist is not simply physically, but also known as the produktseite in the journals - made for specific target, for example, trend-handtaschen, coats, etc. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It told the stylist and designer Mario kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But the only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This means that a stylist must have a good overall picture. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The information on figurentypen angefüllte seasoned samstagsvortrag was right from three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> The stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designers Jakub polanka and the modefotograf Ben renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should be able to take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And eingeschickter stylist can work with a single bekleidungsstück in very different ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The game is variabilität. </seg>
<seg id="145"> For example, can be a trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, such as a t-shirt or cloak, but it can also be on the naked body, absatzschuhe attract, and bear it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It goes up or the Kragen hochzukrempeln and immediately, the whole look is very different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Is this,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I came the following Council wants most: &quot;First of all, you know the rules perfect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Only then must you violate,&quot; Jakub said. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally clear to me why we all these lehrsätze pauken, which can be combined with What and Why, even if you get in modejournalen often quite another to see. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention modeschauen. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben now, I know that needs to have a much more bekleidungsvarianten prepared stylist when he eventually photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So you have for a fashion story of ten pages - i.e. ten outfits - be prepared to stylen at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothes in the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all of this we must count on the shape of the outfits. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and styl sometimes represent half of the success, It also confirmed us Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You only need to be a time to Madonna, a not particularly brilliant sängerin to from the image and marketing have made a weltstar. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic are more reserved for the services of a stylisten. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also known personalities often keep this for rausgeworfenes money - the main thing is that I am something, as I say is secondary. </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if some of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she us great chance of forcing a quite different in smaller size than he or she really needs. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then you need googlen then only to establish with certainty that the popular press writes that the promi back to or have decreased, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario laid on Sunday to leave us, not to believe that a stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the outfit &quot;zusammenzubauen needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work he must, above all, which he stylt and communicate with the people he must be a clever psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People, without anzubiedern and to assess its opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If any of us a director appointed to look to their kleiderschrank and to complement fine pieces, then we can not eliminate the entire storage cupboard and said, my God, this is terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;We need to find at least a couple of good things to which it recommends, what you can carry,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It also showed us specifically, which must include a &quot;platztasche.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> So a bag to be their zuknöpft and we all need to proprietäten carries. </seg>
<seg id="169"> No clear things such as gap, abroller to haareentfernen or sicherheitsnadeln contains, they also utensilien, such as a nylonfaden - it helps the stylist, when photography products such as handbags or from Guard, Special clips, with those behind the clothes gerafft, if it is too big - stecknadeln or other klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken and, of course, nähzeug. </seg>
<seg id="170"> If, however, we must not only listen, but can also try something practically, we learned how to unterklebt shoes right. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And the Atelier photography, where the floor is, you can damage the schuhsohle, let alone the outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> O klebten US and klebten we... </seg>
<seg id="173"> Shoes with the gap, we can not even touch so that they are not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So you have really good approach. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario was praised me to my &quot;Creation&quot; without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The aforementioned skill is not just my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All of this was just a fraction of what we got in the second wochenend-fortsetzungskurs to hear. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One thing is now clear to me - dedicating themselves to styling at professional level, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V need for steroids: &quot;The run&quot; - the illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Rezension </seg>
<seg id="181"> The original reckless journey through a series of completely preventable, dilettantischer failures to routinefahrt frühschicht. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Managed to fulfil the ambitions, in large part, but what use is that, if was obviously no one wants to do a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came to the ladentische, inspired the new part, with the subtitle &quot;The run &apos;high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised, however, the bejahrte spieleserie &quot;need for steroids&quot; Back to postpone a step into a new dimension and the spielbaren really demonstrationsbeispielen, he seemed to be not only one of many action-rennspielen. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the hauptprotagonist be rising out of the car and on foot to continue. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But in the end as it is already used in NFS, is much different than we had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure - potentially quite decent arkade-rennen but overall will detract from some unnecessary errors in the game of this series are present more or less for a couple of years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it is not really a mistake but more signs of incomprehensible laziness of the spieleentwickler in principle. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Once the story will be introduced, whose hauptfigur Jack has some problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, on the west coast, it is the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea involves a number of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route is divided into 10 stages and in more than 50 individual race. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race will be fought on other route and the various stages in different is sufficiently different and interesting environment to take place. </seg>
<seg id="195"> At no time was the impression that game would always offer the same again. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some areas are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of grafik not beyond the earlier parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So nothing weltbewegendes. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Sometimes atypical elements of a little change in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="200"> IN THE DESERT, for example, we will be surprised by a desert storm, which seriously limits point of view. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains, in turn, has to be extremely careful that it is not of a landslide buried. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Incidentally, are fairly well built on the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="203"> While only a few, but they are. </seg>
<seg id="204"> A while so people are trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents, in principle, a classic race, you have time to catch up - classic race against the stoppuhr, then expected a a personal match with a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And this is also the police, which have the whole thing to blow. </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty passages, which Jack out of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is more about certain interactive animationen, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players away to the right button at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as we would expect, specifically only three. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Ultimately, this is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above one of the elements that make the game abwechslungsreicher. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The fahrmodell is in the previous fußtapfen parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that from today&apos;s point, it is not seen Trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But a aktionsgeladenen rennfahren the European fahrmodell will also continue to do quite well, even though the competition could find better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then, has everything so well. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems arise only after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the fahrmodell is kollisionsmodell does not quite OK </seg>
<seg id="218"> A game of this nature is hardly calculated to expect it complicated deformationen and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea, how the car is, it is clearly not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typical example: the close or vorbeifahren to overtake oncoming cars &quot;touches&quot; only slightly, try the other in places in other, almost identical situation but it comes into slings and is wild pirouetten. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or the karre is equal to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the restart-systems makes it no more, annoying is it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The restarts are resolved, when you have destroyed or remote ends up the route, it raises the game back to the last indication of the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It has only five restarts only in each race. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If they have exhausted, Everything is from the lot. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The restarts are something like rather a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but it is hard to leave it. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes does not help time restart, it is nothing less than the critical section to learn from the head. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some trends must be crossed in a very specific way, for example, otherwise you simply does not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere, met in the appropriate place &quot;civilian&quot; cars is in the same configuration, irrespective of whether the first or fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is annoying, especially in situations when you see that the kontrahent a easily two oncoming cars until you even get away, but there is, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or brakes. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it does n&apos;t matter when it comes, everything is designed so that such a situation is always close to their nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have other benefits. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game, there are a few places where we are being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again, regardless of the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> The verrücktesten is the conclusion of the game in the long bridge, the head happens. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The kontrahent must overtake here, obviously, on devil come out. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if it is already time A, then of course it makes a point of view, so they drive their own car a couple of times in Klump initially. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Clear - they want the game simply exciting and are more exciting but the intention is clear, they quickly the joy of the game vermiest. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Be sold and that is a shame because, despite a simpler fahrmodell entertaining and some aktionsgeladen, overall the game is right that there is almost no longer know, where one of the head. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And in principle, regardless of what &quot;blame&quot; - the concept of 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that can not raise boredom, or something completely different... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the wagenwechsel during the race. </seg>
<seg id="241"> We should not overlook the stations on the road, because you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that they are. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousinen to draft the motorways and exotic super-sportwagen for the technical operations, for example, on the serpentinen in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the modus spielgeschichte is also the aufgaben-modus challenges - so the race in each of the lokalitäten, which we know from history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> There is not only to win medals, but also erfahrungspunkte for its profile, which together for the tasks of challenges and history. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To get to higher fahrerniveau, have various items: the car started to be open to the backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is at the same time as the online-funktion autolog to which, among other things, its own results achieved compared with those of other players and also provides for more collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of more incomprehensible schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here we come: with the car in a u-bahn-tunnel - nay, where one in the dark on the long RAST seemed as well. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Look at the tacho paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h - nay, but that is at once to scrap from behind a subway and drives a uncompromising. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editors we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of the spielgestalter or whether the authors for blöd. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall in the majority of cases are agreeable and even brilliant here and there. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even more galling is that some of bildwiederholfrequenz slows exciting times, and sometimes quite dramatic. </seg>
<seg id="254"> The concerns, however, especially the greater number of accidents involved, where a steady FPS nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The tonwiedergabe is as far as OK and the soundtrack geschmackssache. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In an effort to raise a rather young audience as broad as possible scale, created a soundtrack a lá &quot;of any&quot; - but who buys such a game because of the music?! </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall need for steroids: the run? the feelings are more mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game would not detract from the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors, we have with the brustton convinced able to claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But in fact, the game somehow unfertig. </seg>
<seg id="260"> To a class of pleasure, but you should be prepared that these errors with the power of flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye. </seg>

<seg id="276"> Eu-botschafterin vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have the reputation of negativisten and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt pulling out of the &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I did not expect to have such a hard war entbrennt. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will take five to six years, until the dust settling and all will be accustomed to her new role,&quot; began Milena vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, strongly their presentation to the law faculty. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How seriously it takes the motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe,&quot; Ladies and gentlemen, was already in the first part of their address, in which it gained the institutions of the EU and its relationship to such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some Lektor the Law Faculty of the karlsuniversität should therefore have beneiden. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs vicenová, also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;Initially, criticism that he is too smoothly - a grey official, was no match for such a role, but I have to say that it has all the breath up how well he has adopted the cause. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a man, it is ready to listen patiently to 27 Member States to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then said in response to the question: who is the actual - the European Union should? what number I call? &apos;, that is to say, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the policy on States, such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to ban our ölmützer quargel </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs vicenová devoted the agenda, according to which the European Union intends to lives lived, and lives in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Summit for Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government during the presidency, describing it as a major negativum, which have severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech currently has its hands full representation in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the Ambassador said, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome, quite lively. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there is still the EU&apos;s sieben-jahres-budget are approved, what makes it precisely because of the present economic situation much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it is a schlankes and thrifty budget which industries will be given, which countries more and less support - all of that is now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which they came to Brussels: &quot;understandable on Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;If I do not like something, it is gräuliche acronym, fremdwörter and jargon that no one understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really krumme or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels invented just now or whether anyone actually want to ban the quargel us. </seg>
<seg id="298"> They used the soil of the EU also would like to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of the prospect of two or different speeds </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the eu-botschafterin the Czechs in the Eurosceptics, the more the negative reputation, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivierungsbriefe and, last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, the Force&apos;s and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, of V4 shows. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian to me and is a slowake in the vicinity, then does the Frenchman beside me:&quot; Hey, what is your view the heads together - this is your V4 again? &apos;and it makes a pretty acid look. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Mrs vicenové expect the EU particularly tough rules for the budget-politik of Member States in the future. </seg>
<seg id="306"> A lot of real as a &quot;European Federation&quot; is the concept of a Europe of the two, or even different speeds. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;Here we have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We already have the Schengen area and we have to institute a bestärkten cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, want it, and those who do not want to calm Stand aside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately amounts to a&quot; strong &quot;Europe of the various speeds,&quot; Mrs vicenová expected. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed by all Member States, and not just by the countries of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Fire story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> IBM&apos;s innovator is the second century of his existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM characterized most closely, then this would probably be the word &quot;longevity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public is IBM, a synonym for technological revolution, we know it as a modern businesses, though a century has passed since its inception. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this longevity, already submitted its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he was of the slogan that countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were willing to think a bit. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; has been a hallmark, playing for the life of the future giants should - and at the same Time magazine to the title of the firmeninternen, IBM already began in years 1935 issue. </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the watsen thoroughly prepared culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM means this long term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM, survived and was also a whole century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not be zurückschreckte, anything to change it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That allowed us during our first century, the technology to transform the business and of the society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years, &quot;said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Well thought out system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson operation in the 1930s, social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the ibm-leute had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance by entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms as arbeitsbekleidung and a well thought out entlohnungssystem for best innovators and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As more sophisticated, IBM&apos;s long term relationship with their customers. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant from the start in the talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM, choose any subject - and was accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year by a woman abgewechselt - Virginia rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The IBM is 30 years in it, so far, the position of the vetriebs-, marketing and strategiechefin. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM power in the last few years&apos; online-brainstormings, come from which many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - ideas, there is enough in the company is employing almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Their unshakeable position in business the company guaranteed a strong image and both internally and externally. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution that, rather than a mere technologie-unternehmens,&quot; said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, rosabeth moss kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technologie-unternehmen, but a firm that helps solve the geschäftsprobleme by technology,&quot; added George colony of consulting-firma Forrester research added. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself points out, it does make a difference, only to be present on the market or forms by This presence directly to him. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - in the states of their logo because family called &quot;Big Blue,&quot; is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the vielseitigsten IBM hardware and software, developed infrastructure, technologie-unternehmen any hosting and konsultationsleistungen in an incredible produktbreite - of servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Of all American technologie-unternehmen, IBM has the most patents and five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> To its most famous inventions include, for example, bankautomaten, credit cards, finanzswap bar code or the diskette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With about $220 billion stock exchange value - market capitalization - IBM this year was the second largest technologie-unternehmen - immediately after Apple, Microsoft outdated and it for the first time since 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate example of the attempt with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online-service prodigy or computer IBM PC Jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Business is based on advances achieved, that is to say, we should not emotionell tie to the past,&quot; says Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem, his ground to build - and if they do not work on various platforms, leaving it. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to counterpart to Microsoft, which in principle with its operating system, Windows and falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> Participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest level of services, software and hardware participate on each one fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> It was 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most represented. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets to the value of $15 billion, at the same time it invested $58 billion purchase of promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In this investionen continued IBM after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Here, too, IBM was loyal to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression increased its investitionsumfang. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today&apos;s crisis without prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the ibm-aktien rose raketenartig by 120 percent since 2008, and the company&apos;s profit grows kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The unternehmensslogan of IBM is: Not everything can change - just the values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also can be expected to meistert this flexible giant the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Ibm-geschichte, from käseschneider to weltallflügen </seg>
<seg id="358"> The Society IBM established 100 years ago in New York - International Business Machines initially had a rather complicated names - computing tabulating recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The name IBM took until 1924 - originally was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The foundations for subsequent society, IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history of the 19th century until the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They owned technologies such as the famous stechkartenuhren on the registration of arbeitsbeginns and -endes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architects of this new company, Charles ranlett Flint, who had until 1930 also holds the presidency of the board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint, the head of the konkurrenzfirma Thomas J. Watson hit, so that helped him the leadership of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson&apos;s ideas until now the company&apos;s unbesiegbare culture and identity. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the Company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, began, as the name reveals, with the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - wurst-und käseschneidern, to spending. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In the first four decades in which Watson the firm, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company expandierte after all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was indispensable to the company so that it all sat in the chefsessel for 40 years, only then, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson younger. </seg>
<seg id="369"> IBM under whose leadership began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programmiersprache. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s helped IBM technicians and computers from NASA to Direct flights into space - the Merkur and Saturn devouring and back in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, IBM, back in 1964, the first rechnerfamilie with equal rechnerarchitektur - the number of IBM System / 360. </seg>

<seg id="373"> Twenty years later veräußerte IBM his rechnerproduktion on Lenovo Chinese society, on the other hand, they bought the company&apos;s konsultantenteil PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose now fully consultingleistungen and services with high added value in the business. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy, which IBM paying off in the last three years is the concept of &quot;smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> It is the intention of technologies used in a wise way has not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in the transport and städteverwaltung. </seg>
<seg id="376"> IBM recently led the &apos;smarter commerce platform in trade, &quot;to help the dealers, to lead the entire commercial cycle. </seg>

<seg id="439"> Some women and tratschen clap like, as will behind the backs of getuschelt or even slander or you forge alliances. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are now focused on relations, so they hecheln like issues, such as, for example - who, where, when and with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Women every one of us has a bit of harmless gossip and tratsch in camp. </seg>

<seg id="444"> Jágr and voráček understand Philadelphia with their assistenzen for victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The eishockeystürmer Mr Jágr had at the montagsspiel NHL with two assistenzen large share of the 5:3-sieg of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and it is once again produktivster Czech players in the NHL. </seg>

<seg id="453"> Voráček won behind the door of the hurricanes puck and presented it between the circles to the successful maxim Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> One second before the first third of the heimspieler Patrick Dwyer achieved a abpfiff short-hander, but the second third was the flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hits, then drew Wayne Simmonds whose shot for the fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="464"> Little read prevented any further complication, however, in which he was successful in majority two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Excellent pronger acted in our area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He got off to the puck experimented with, I took journey and Mr read, to more distant pfosten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to meet him and I am glad that it worked,&quot; voráček described the last hits of the game from his point of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> By this victory, Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The candiens büßten alongside their know Beck their leadership unverloren the penalty-schießen 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> One of the strafschüsse Tomáš plekanec could not turn. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the money bets lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team all the high krankheitsbedingte loss on the defensive - they played only five abwehrspielern to end the game. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;This is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;The game we played only to end with a single experienced players, the rest were young players.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But because there is nothing, we have to be ready,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;In any change a surge of attacks to rival after another and we had nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We would make the game easier and puck from our third rausbringen must.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> There was still room for improvement, &quot;said P. K. subban, one of the abwehrspieler. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech torhüter Ondřej pavelec objected 30 shots from Tampa Bay and contributed greatly to the 5:2-sieg on Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the Jets to a series of five defeats concluded, had five different protect share. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of the reisepreise since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989, there was only five approved of the čssr state agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agents at all, only sold in the Socialist ostblockländer, in the West were then select. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, the Soviet Union - Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea, the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary in the Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then a pro-Western course, Yugoslavia and therefore have severely restricted the travel to Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialist times, it was that there are not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc, as well as the tschechoslowaken was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> For example, if a citizen of the čssr individual wanted to travel to Poland, or even in the Soviet Union, then took it to the einladungsbrief, otherwise individualreisen were not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then, travel agents also offered huge queues in the West, but then we had to accept or even before the schlafsack agent stay, or at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Also the matter was far from over. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The of devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the West - were given only &quot;politically reliable&quot; People travel - the others were not. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovakia&apos;s currency was not free umtauschbare currency, without devisenzusage, it would have been impossible, the necessary funds find in Western currency for a trip to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The weither most Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder, therefore, that the Czechs countless wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that still continues. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Velvet Revolution of 1989, following a reiserevolution Czechs in the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> During a holiday in the GDR or until 1989 in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year were 4.5 million of its auslandsferien in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A huge paradox, one that we no longer aware today is the fact that the currently popular urlaubsland of Czechs - Croatia could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> From the start of the 1990s, of the last century was the devisenpflicht lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which is a huge wave after wave of kurzbesuchen especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany stir. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The tschechoslowaken long time of travel in the West simply could not enough was there, everyone wanted to get at least a couple of days. </seg>
<seg id="498"> So schliefen Czech tourists travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a canned beer, and dauerwurst, etc. vollgepackter kofferraum. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades, our tourists the Western currency was finally free shopping. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our level, thereby also durchschnittsgehälter surged into another important moment einmündete in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agents began after 1997 prepare regularly travels through charters, which travel thanks to negotiate the possibility of mengenrabatte, incredibly cheap compared to the past. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, made the travel more easily. </seg>
<seg id="504"> To another interesting moment in the history of the &quot;post-samtenen &apos;travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand - have been the first direct charter in an exotic country dealt to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then fly direct charter-flugzeuge with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries every year; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> In the 100 TSD, Czechs travel every year in exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the era of our development marked &quot;post-revolutionary,&quot; came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the United States visas for Czech tourists, which is einreihte definitely our country under the advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> The Czechs spent in 2008 for the first time more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in their history they gave to a single urlaubsaufenthalt, including the cost of per capita CZK resort more than 15 TSD.. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Meeting is to find a new chairman, again there is a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> The Czech Football has no chairman for almost five months and there is the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech fußballverbands - fačr - not even after the Extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known. </seg>
<seg id="512"> There is still no agreement, after what election rules should be elected. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without this No vote on the three potential successors is possible. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three players would manage the Czech football - Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomáš paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June, Hašek back from his post, where he had his colleagues in the departure of calling to some and a strong personality, could lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old disputes between the two verbandskammern again, which can not agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was clearly on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates were quite free to volkshaus general meeting in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial produced no result and it was not just about the election itself. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Indeed, one could not even agree on who the vollsammlung is entitled to vote - only the satzungsmäßigen representatives or equipped with an authority officials. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and right contributed, whose opinion after a representation to vollmachtbasis is not admissible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes in order to take the election rules, however, remains. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Also the executive did not have more clarity on the matter at its meetings - regardless of whether ordinary and extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the views on the election changed a couple of times - the neuralgic point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how can we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is the question of whether it should approach in line with the Statute, or whether a very different model needs to be found,&quot; said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the fačr, in the management of the profi-fußball represents. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to satzungsmäßigem model Triumphs in the third round of the candidate, the greater prozentuelle standing support in the Chamber, for which he received. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher stimmenanzahl receives from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side again, on the condition that the winner of this prozentuellen election receives at least a two to one vote. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Then the two vorrunden make no sense, this modus would call into question the entire zweikammerkonzept,&quot; Svoboda understands the objections of the mährischen side, it would be best, not hinzubiegen, but under current statute to choose the election rules. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Surprisingly, Tomáš paclík agrees with this, even if it emerges that the institution most probably pelta against election rules of all candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;It is my wish that largely elected by the statute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;Not unreasonable ersatzvarianten thought out, as in the past,&quot; said the owner of the fußballklubs Victoria General Meeting Plzeň, standing for the first time in his opinions and, above all pelta to abgrenzte. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta but remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> His opinion, known in Nymburk the new chairman and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The time possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly lead to calm the minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;If the football only on the euphoric wave is, it is the willingness to cooperate more,&quot; says the official Jablonec, all three adepten the greatest experience in both professional and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl as cautious. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes&quot; officialdom. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;A new block at the General Meeting is therefore not excluded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope, however, that common sense prevails,&quot; said rajchl finally. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is no longer. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should supposedly directly experienced in Montenegro, but who knows whether the fußballgeneralität until qualification game will actually be completely. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charterflugzeug, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and rajchl should fly to podgorice, in Prague on tomorrow because of a technical disorder could not launch and we sought urgently for a ersatzvariante, as there is a part of the Executive Committee but to the site of the barrage-hinspiels. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Ultimately, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Joseph Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and physical education would have divided parties within the country&apos;s largest sportverbands moved to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> So there is a lot at stake: state benefits, vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the čstv, the Czech sport after the financial problems of SAZKA the new direction. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates </seg>
<seg id="549"> If Tomáš paclík, the head of the pilsner footballers of the Extraordinary General Meeting to have a strong candidates can represent all of his ideas on the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands - fačr had met, if he had not signed up to the fight for this position at all. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is a good candidate, I would fight for him and to renounce the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, it is not such a adepten to find,&quot; said paclík ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for paclík to match with Miroslav pelta and Jindřich rajchl to go, it is to ensure that the supposed favorites of the election, pelta, at the top of the fačr anyway. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also emphasised that, in the event of his victory intends to exercise the role of chairman only a year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Seen in the position of the President he would like to know top-manager, which is not involved in the fußballgeschehen too much. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;with some people in question, I personally have spoken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;Hard to believe that some said to me that you were currently not identify with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such views would like changed,&quot; he led. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all paclík allegedly disrupting the pelta&apos;s links with the chairman of the pilsner bezirksfußballverbands novel berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, and with the ability to influence delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings will. </seg>
<seg id="559"> It is for this reason for paclík unacceptable that pelta had held the position of the chairman. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;in his victory would einkonserviert and today&apos;s situation in the Czech football is not making any progress at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The support of berbr, a cleverem businessman, football would badly,&quot; said paclík twice. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Here it is also important that pelta&apos;s name in connection with telephone to identify some time ago in a korruptionsaffaire fell, however, the pelta go unpunished emerged. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know what kind of prestige a victory of pelta - tsch. - Football should get involved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said řekl paclík, his former saying, &quot;He will Pilsner sell fußballklub if pelta Chairman will&quot; see, but something about. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Paclík, should the donnerstagwahl victories, he could present a future cooperation with pelta well, however. </seg>
<seg id="566"> As another candidate - rajchl, thinks the paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;he - pelta - would be the first, I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great skills.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine him a good example, as head of the national team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I if my nose resides not in matters that I do not understand,&quot; said paclík, so providing for attention in September that he was behind the recall of the schiedsrichterkommission with luďěk macela replaced at the top level, the Dagmar damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík even claimed that he felt the role of the verbandsvorsitzenden increased. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And refers to his skills in the leadership of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with his support in May the first celebrated triumph in the league. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the power to change something in the fußballmilieu and contribute to a certain degree of cultivation of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disziplinar- and berufungskommissionen, which led to degenerate into horrific situations,&quot; paclík, no secret of his antipathy towards the sparta-chef Daniel Křetínský power, for example. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of its priorities, would be the strengthening of relations between the fačr and the Czech olympia-komitee, with whose help he would lobbyieren that the political leaders for more money from the lotteriesteuer goes into the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the key issues that should be addressed the new chairman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;When it comes to taxation of glückspielen declare, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but then they must also state clearly where the money is going,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclík is also not a handicap to his link to the pilsner club, even though he stresses that the Chairman of the fačr must be &quot;non-partisan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is associated with Jablonec, rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;It makes sense, in my opinion, but not much my shares in the club of Pilsner hypocritical to a transfer of drittperson after 18 months back again,&quot; said the paclík clear. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the fačr, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the fußballverbands promised one of the candidates for the vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav pelta, it will get in the case of his election campaign for the fačr gets new statutes, excluded from the dispute over the election rules in the future. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official Jablonec is the donnerstagsverhandlung Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be defuse safe in any success of the Czech selection. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September in the event of his choice, he wanted to focus the team and the collection of funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided only at the last moment, to take part in the election before the last general meeting and liked him two months break help to defend his ideas on the running of football and present in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels are devoted to football, They are impatient and expect, therefore, that the chairman on Thursday is known.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the jablonecer club, but in fact many years in Sparta and the executive acted. </seg>
<seg id="590"> He also believes that it has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football do. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria, the days of Ivan Hašek was. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June approved statutes, which were not so completely, as all had adopted. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If you had not allowed different interpretations, from September onwards we have already had a Chairman, &quot;pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="594"> The revision of the most important document of the Residents&apos; Association he used as a lure for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;I should be president, then I accept its myself and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;This is a fundamental thing, without which he can not be,&quot; claims pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In further attempts to it does not, its opponents to define. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Earlier he had announced that it will be able to cooperate with Jindřich rajchl imagine that he recognises because his legal education and he knows well that opposition would be his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Also Tomáš paclík grip he no longer, which in turn was no dry up pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football, it moves for over a year and can already point to some successes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;but its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;Therefore doubt now addressed many of his real character,&quot; pelta remain faithful to his opponents, the most proklamierungen, which he said in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> It believes its biggest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest spielklassen, to the team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And it should be the flagship Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;I would also like to make all affairen to end - from the korruptionsskandals causa Bohemians, to the nachhallen of last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Straight after that I would like to bring negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football,&quot; said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football would mean no personnel cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would first like to familiarise themselves with the arbeitsinhalt of all employees,&quot; he said in the direction of Strahov, where because of the long anarchy there is understandably nervous. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday not free travel to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If really should be the only point of controversy, as it votes in the third round, then we can get over.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and makes it only by back when he finally has a new leader,&quot; pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his funktionärskarriere remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the fačr below him to work hard begins </seg>
<seg id="613"> When the deputy chairman of Jindřich rajchl at the General Meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands should be elected, that would supposedly many people in the Association of vermiesen the humour. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that we begin to work hard in the case of his choice. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce a system changes and the members of the executive responsible for individual fußballbereiche. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise, to continue the work that the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;as President I would like to pay football as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="618"> From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the nationalauswahl, professional football, to the leistungsfußball for young people. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;I am not saying that I want to do everything alone,&quot; said rajchl in talks for ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a teamspieler and would, therefore, like to distribute the executive powers so that each Member pays a certain area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football in each segment with meilenschritten to progress. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> Many would not just delighted about this, because it now, rather than criticise the work of others, even should start to work really hard, &quot;he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the fußballbewegung have considered to stand no longer. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;I know that I am working 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly stick between the legs and every step I have to throw in question,&quot; he said as an explanation as to why he had hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> But &quot;a lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise it would others.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="628"> Allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work that he has begun between Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;We have a great deal of work completed in two years and I will now not just throw away.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;processes have been launched, have to wait for a few years to reflect and I would not see anyone stop,&quot; he said, and has now expressed his concerns, in case the other candidate - Miroslav pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in systematic approach and this is not something that Mirek pelta brings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Stand behind him, above all people, which would make the football, that he would be there only for politicians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> It can be some blame, but not to me, I would be biased. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="636"> It also rejects the claim that he was a chairman of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do the best for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and a mährischen part, whose winners in each of the first league aufstiegen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;That, it might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players to play in Moravia is a problem,&quot; rajchl says. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now the head of the pilsner clubs Tomáš paclík has joined the fight about the role of the chairman, rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which refer to their elected deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me,&quot; led rajchl, the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unvorteilhafte treaties, the fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the agreement lotteriegesetz sees as its success. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association is not in a single direction. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he pelta says, &quot;He was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help,&quot; He sees the second rivals - paclík as a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If he is elected, he would probably continue the things the Ivan Hašek has launched, the staff in the commissions, he would obviously not fundamentally change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> He would certainly Not the things in its favor hinbiegen want, &quot;Judgments rajchl on his rivals. </seg>

<seg id="686"> Deutsche Bank is rohstoff-geschäft review </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Is the German bank with agricultural commodities to their business? </seg>
<seg id="689"> After spiegel-online-informationen, Josef Ackermann, appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the konzernchef then draw conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the bundesbürger the matter is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agrar-rohstoffen speculate such as wheat and maize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of the respondents, even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of this business, because it is exacerbating the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a forsa-umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented to the foodwatch in October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It shows the author Harald Schuman, the betting on the global rohstoffbörsen push up prices - and therefore the banks bear the blame on global hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the body providing protection for consumers is specifically against deutsche-bank-chef Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Rohstoffwetten were initially intended to secure traders against price volatility. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But now, most experts agree that the zocker of supply and demand have decoupled - and at the expense of the poorest profits. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike the us-konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to look into the allegations and said, &quot;It is not a business value, the good reputation of the German Bank compromised.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to Spiegel online an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch-report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review aims to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, how it should be handled. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January to the top of the bank then say what consequences it creates. </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the end of May be a reduction of rohstoffgeschäfts, or even the complete departure. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann forge on his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch-chef thilo bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The bet on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks damage the common good today.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann as Supreme bankenlobbyist stand special duty. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The German bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices,&quot; said bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;regardless of whether Mr Ackermann for people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the konzernchef a few months before his departure from the office would like to make a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The German bank announced on Monday that will not change in the boards of the CEO different than planned. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a retreat from the controversial agrar-spekulation could aufbessern his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> He hardly needs to do - and possible losses it had, after all, his successor. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every second rohstoff-anlagen would announce </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far, already more than 30,000 users took part in the campaign of the organisation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday bode published the survey, for which the Institute forsa 1001 has asked people on 7 and 8 November. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just 11 per cent, so it is legitimate for the Deutsche Bank facilities offering, where prices for food gewettet. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many clients would also draw Personal consequences, when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: every second, according to the poll, would, in which money flows into the rohstoff-spekulation cancel all installations. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 per cent would discourage known of such a bank, 49 per cent, to reflect, to terminate your account and switch to another Institute. </seg>

<seg id="724"> A architekturgeschichte with ups, Downs and happy ending: the Austrian weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels 1958 won prices, has been to the museum in Vienna, and verkam was empty. </seg>
<seg id="725"> It is now reopened as a ausstellungshaus. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If modern nachkriegsarchitektur geschwärmt, clear forms, glass halls, courageous schwüngen and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in the technical progress, the Austrian pavilions located the architect Karl schwanzer is for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers pavilions located, then won the Grand Prix d architecture for his easy and schwebend acting stahl-glas-konstruktion. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction of valid until today as a cornerstone of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He gave the architects known, that also Austria&apos;s next World Expo pavilions located built. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary bmw-vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem nebenbau in Munich, he was 1973 finally internationally renowned. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His planned as a temporary ausstellungsbau pavilions located there was established after the world in Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof converted and 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - it was called the &quot;20s house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building but was neither physically and technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless, it has been so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna was getting a new house. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now, the architect Adolf krischanitz pavilions located rebuilt, he is now &quot;21er House&quot; and is used as a museum of contemporary art in the future. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere opened, which includes the House, the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes husslein-arco has enforced the New START, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere was in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-arco, qualified art historian with considerable career including the youth as eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, began strongly among politicians and the denkmalschützern, they acquired the restructuring and private sponsorengelder and determined the use of public resources. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Fritz wotruba except gegenwartskunst, the works of the bildhauers should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop, it should be, and a bürohaus had to be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation was krischanitz the ideal person to work. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because it Joseph olbrichs secession sensitive converted and extended in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he has studied in schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilions located &quot;was, for him, an&quot; incredibly important place in which he had seen &quot;Almost every weekend&quot; the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the ur-entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his umnutzung generosity and easily lost. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: the building was &quot;a energieschleuder,&quot; says krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The fensterprofile outside glass were replaced, glasfaserverstärktes isolierglas used, and the glasdach replaced by special sicherheitsglas. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Kältebrücken-stahlträger are strengthened, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been repaired or replaced. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two untergeschosse led to space for the New use, abgesenkter lichtgraben between the house and the road is belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy schwanzer-pavillon. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rostschutz-farbton removed. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the kinosaal even very, just as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all of which will be under strict supervision of the denkmalbehörde and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;A material often had to be found, it is good and is cheap and the denkmalschutzamt appealed to,&quot; says krischanitz and points to a ruppigen soil, in the untergeschoss. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, problems and restructurings, the building remained flexible and easily. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Was it difficult with the pavilions located, &quot;the daherkam from Brussels,&quot; krischanitz has recently said that a typical &quot;drop-in-the-city-geschichte.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> This kind of architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place,&quot; and was still &quot;create a proper awareness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case it is 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke of luck pass: around the Swiss garden is just the completely new planned &quot;hauptbahnhofsquartier &apos;, with offices and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21er House could increase by another krischanitz-bau, because the sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary kunsthalle bought, and we hear that they have to negotiate with the city by a garden of neighbourly location within the Swiss. </seg>

<seg id="845"> What it means if the internal peace in Germany in danger, clarified the attacks of mölln and solingen in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photograph of the brandruine of solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event showed the Turks living evident that there is a tangible threat, and the German that distrust and distance can result in right violence. </seg>

<seg id="855"> The skandalbank of zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS during the financial crisis was almost bankrupt and slides from one crisis to the next since then. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is now a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Axel Weber so it was certainly not intended. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July that he would compete 2013, almost as a spectacular new job: verwaltungsratspräsident Swiss big UBS - an unexpected and lucrative karriereschritt. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber pleased publicly praised the Swiss whether their beauty and UBS whether their new fall solidity and has gained warm comments about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS, the turnaround managed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September, it became clear that it would be completely different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of UBS in London was all security systems of the bank and around 1.7 billion euros, verzockt bypassed. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald raised grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The verwaltungsratspräsident of UBS, also wounded as - and since then all questions: When will finally Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already, it became known that Weber can advise the Bank of February in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber, the tough. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Instead, he is not a banker, professor and bankers and would have had a einarbeitungszeit certainly needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> In one fell swoop, he assumes the responsibility for a bank&apos;s strategy, which has once again proved that they have long been deserves the title of &quot;biggest skandalbank Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the UBS is one huge - until recently, it was the world&apos;s biggest asset manager, slides and on the other by a scandal over the next for years. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is of the once proud Swiss bank? </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be a very large number in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So the UBS managed on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion in 2007 vermögender customers more money than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, it was vorgerückt as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and subsequent longstanding bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: &quot;my students, I have the UBS then always presented a model of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;from today&apos;s point of view, we are asking: how could I am just so wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He mistaken huge. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, for the first time was apparently substantial schieflief that something in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, chief executive Peter wuffli surprising back until that was regarded as a hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, we ahnte why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The bank&apos;s investmentsparte was faced with subprime-papieren verzockt and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to shoulders, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of a record 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> This was actually investors, however, what about some have until just before the nose gerümpft: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds of Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, so was denied that they do not learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> It was worse in April 2008. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to provide new milliardenverluste verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel ospel, even of the next best paid board of the Swiss, resigned in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments on the brink of collapse during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a zwangswandelanleihe, on which you could be miteigentümerin of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Shocked the whole of Switzerland was dramatically - because they said, as it is for a small country, if it has large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times as large as the performance of the Swiss - see grafik. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again, we could not save UBS,&quot; says bankenforscher Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> First on the disaster, the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months to surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and responded to the data on vermögender customers had hinterzogen issue, perhaps with the help of the bank tax. </seg>
<seg id="900"> They also agreed a payment of $780 million to - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and strafaufschlag. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Known for the UBS helped, more or less open to tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for rich clients: the mystique of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the resignation of chief executive and verwaltungsratspräsident. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of kundengeldern. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the Bank within a few months had lost its credibility in two key portfolios: by the fehlspekulationen in investment banking and asset management by the support for tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just as it has been somewhat calmer again, just as they thought the UBS will now get it once again, there is this unfortunate händler-geschichte: an individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something goes wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is clearly: the risk management in the investment banking work apparently still do not. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;with the case of adoboli, we must see the risikokontrolle too little has changed,&quot; says Martin Janssen, an economist and finanzprofessor on bankinstitut of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also finanzvorstand a large German bank is sure: &quot;The problem of UBS, the risikokontrolle not under control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> But it was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers have been stood for a long time, guardian of the major assets of the world: not too great a risk to security for money - was the alpenrepublik time across the world to collapse. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The tresore of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and sprüngli is especially noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The core of the UBS in Zurich does still fit the stereotype of the sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is already classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich bahnhofstraße, which leads from the Central Station, directly to the zürichsee by the Swiss mountains frames is true, the schneebedeckten summits. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are magnificent, the ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Juweliere as we Tiffany&apos;s will take place between Swiss traditionsgeschäften as the Confiserie sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Reside here for centuries the Swiss banks: the Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The empfangssaal UBS is one with a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls marmorverkleidet before big ledersessel, in addition to the bank-logo a great sign for &quot;safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS know what the customer is here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse betrayed, but eventually ousted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank will take place. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all power, as Swiss Bankers, business with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become far too big, it will also - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have spread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss have nothing more to say there. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if there is, you have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, the UBS modified, only high profits and then delivering the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the subprime-dschungel as the Swiss big. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;on that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of small siebenmillionenlandes the largest bailout in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lucas hässig, in his book &quot;The ubs-crash.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians, to save the big facing bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How did this come about? </seg>
<seg id="932"> We talk with Swiss bankers, So you see the problem, particularly in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks to an enormous company. </seg>
<seg id="934"> There was a bank, which is already in the merger was too big for the little Switzerland - and steadily grew. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different vorläufer-banken supplemented the UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank focused Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly the internationalisierten favourable investment bankers came to a lot of money that they could make a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 konzernchef of UBS, and Marcel ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that wuffli and ospel were a traumteam,&quot; bankenforscher Hans Geiger says. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;wuffli, hochintellektuelle, humble, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and ospel, the top of the bauchmensch, up from the banklehre has heraufgearbeitet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But the closure of ospel was rely on wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake in the end: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; Geiger says. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: embolden came before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Staff of the UBS is clearly remember the führungskräfte-meetings, on which konzernchef wuffli dethrone again and again to the same slogan: Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American Bank was the world&apos;s most powerful Investment Bank. </seg>
<seg id="947"> They led the league with &apos;, &quot;the rankings, which documented the success of the banks the time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then, wanted to UBS, according to top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> A few steps were already have it. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the devisengeschäft and trade in shares, she played at the very top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Unternehmensberater which have been charged, highlighted a weakness, however: the international zinsgeschäft, in the bankersprache &quot;fixed income,&quot; there is a huge gap to the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS have gaps in American hypothekenprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, travelled UBS in an adventure that you almost cost the existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, both the bank and invested a gegründeter hedge funds in American subprime-anlagen ahead. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It into a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage packaged and weiterreichte - but it also risks kept. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also, as other banks long sought the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS has bought there,&quot; says bankenexperte Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The euphoria so great, so deeply. </seg>
<seg id="959"> The manager had to go after the other, as did the attempts were more difficult than had been thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Post in the UBS became schleudersitz and are still shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the big now, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He needs to find a strategy for a bank, all of the obvious abhandengekommen business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bankenforscher Geiger already has an idea: End in investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank will go - yet - not quite as far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking will shrink sharply, this much is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, will present the world&apos;s new bankchef Sergio ermotti its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Of the 51 years old italo-schweizer was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank surprisingly separated by predecessor grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Now he has enforced: he is permanently the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants the investment bank to back the state in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3,500 delete it. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What will they earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber already is safe. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he says so far, with his wife but he will first seek a home in Zurich. </seg>

<seg id="1479"> &quot;My alarm bells,&quot; said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the texanerin wischte aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &quot;Oh, what he is 19 </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I had listened to my gut instincts.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former militärangestellte anxiously await a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a complaint, the against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is made, the courts have allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint claims that gates and Rumsfeld, not against the widespread rape within the military and acted in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>

<seg id="1488"> Burke says that they had the Supreme military command, because that is where the problem starts. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The military is hierarchical,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals that are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? the leadership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that it has almost 400 more survivors contacted since February, many of them could be part of future complaints. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: instead of All claimants, their eggs in one basket, you will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of defence for the defense ministry, led by bundesstaatsanwalt Neil macbride, has made a request to reject complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the Court before Newsweek with, in detail, the defense strategy to, first of all, that the military can not be prosecuted for violations by current or former soldiers, to which it has come into the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Because of a law of the 1950 Supreme Court, known as the feres-doktrin, has the government not for injuries to the soldiers currently on active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged damage during the militärdienstes the plaintiff,&quot; the document states. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry refused any comment on this story. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are still not admitted to the service in the fight, the distinction is only in name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Play both in Iraq and in Afghanistan build teams of female soldiers such increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars 150 female soldiers such, two thirds of them died in hostilities. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it is not alone in your struggle: three other complaints but their are pending. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The veterans&apos; legal services clinic at Yale Law School preparing a case against the four main military colleges because of alleged promotion of a highly misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>

<seg id="1508"> 2010, according to the sexual assault prevention and response office - DT.: Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse - of the Defence Ministry 3.158 sexual abuses reported. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and in its own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 cases, which it estimated per year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, which was published in March, is also examining the strafverfolgungsraten: 2010, 20% of the cases in the military court, covered only half as many as in civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burke&apos;s case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumen. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In lymans case reported the alleged rape of the Military Police less than an hour after the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> On this night, she says, it was 11 times, the details of their rape asked a number of police officers to tell doctors and befehlshabern. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She had a vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during the hearing, she was asked about the sex that you had before the attack with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people said as charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which was ultimately acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was read out,&quot; Lyman says. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought the labor would use. I running schreiend from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They brought me to the psychiatric unit, and I remember that I, as I once again appeared to my commander said that the procedure was not his, that was my procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman has been invited to a militärpsychiater go, the end to a personality disorder diagnostizierte and dienstunfähig said. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, you dishonourable was sacked, so that it receives no support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have presented, is, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nonetheless, it says: &quot;In my view, they should move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between you and a verdict, this doctrine, which is criticized, for the first time since it was called into question. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am always a critic of the feres-doktrin. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive, and the same deterrence, which brings with it a liability. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot;The odds are against you... but it is important for you to try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will only change when good people are ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff&apos;s lawyer, start with its hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight until the military in this respect there is reform,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, which always comes first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes, as researchers watching you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he became The New Face of the extreme right in Europe, Norway Anders Behring breivik was only one of many boys, the anti-einwanderungsmeinung online programs. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, breivik, who has been committed with a gun in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, extreme groups on the part of social support networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how will they be? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is easy - you only have to look at Facebook connect. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We have noted that it was not difficult to come to you,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report of the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks hiding place of personal data is enzyklopädisch, Bartlett, says that the researchers simply use the werbetool side need to define their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers have done for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found half a million fans of extreme right wing groups in the whole of Europe and then visierte with adds, But rather than with a new band or the adds users have a new diätprodukt verlinken, invited to a survey, in which after their education, their attitude towards violence and asked the assessment of their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult only once Her Office had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is quite a new method of inquiry,&quot; Bartlett says. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the little surprise results. online-förderer of extreme right wing groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a kind of surprising distortion, &quot;Those who combine their online-aktivismus with a offline-aktivismus sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain seated behind her computerbildschirmen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Demos work is just one example of how Facebook will mean a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientist will use the side to study everything from health to gesellschaftstrends as &quot;likes, text messages and statusaktualisierungen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users, facebooks generated the add three content per day on average, &quot;datensupernova&quot; forschungsboom, the number of scientific work in the name of this side of the title in the last five years has increased by almost 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook is the fact that by studying this side of people, which is normally in the street with his clipboard can not achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;If you tried to ask the British National Party, people earlier, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;They had to inform the party first and should never have been granted entry,&quot; Bartlett says. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook is all this way, they will go directly to you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the side offers an opportunity to see and to resolve social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who vollrausch discussed on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problemtrinken than students who remained silent on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, wohnberater, monitor the side and a students help if too many statusaktualisierungen postet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can not solve a problem if you have not seen it,&quot; said Dmitry Christakis, morenos ko-autor and Director of The Child Health, behavior and development at Seattle Children&apos;s Research Institute of the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, which would not have been found otherwise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook and zapft constantly the data of its own people. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The datenteam the side has statistics on the beziehungsstatus and Valentine&apos;s Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national glücksindex produced - and first of all claims have been used, have access to the only Facebook - master of the digital freedom have long known that the side of their huge datenfundgrube for others to make research available. - </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But the users of Facebook, observed that the side you know, whether you like it or not, to a friend, which is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side one&apos;s own personal data auszubringen. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they do not even know about? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, is anything goes online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not think that many people have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As for you, it was only for you and your friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in a nutzerprofil and in speeches. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What they say on Facebook and what we do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,&quot; Selwyn says. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore, Selwyn despite his years as a technologieforscher considers that a clipboard and a stift are still the best forschungswerkzeuge that everyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute for going into the real world and with real people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;social research must deal with the social - and plenty of social life will take place still offline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Norway Anders Behring breivik appears for the first time in a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Norway Anders Behring breivik, the man who has been two amokläufe, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, even in his first appearance before a public court has described as a &quot;Resistance fighters&quot; in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a militärkommandeur in the Norwegian resistance and a tempelritter Norway,&quot; he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object to the Court, as they have received their mandate of organizations, supporting the hassideologien support and because multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognise the laws, but I am not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge torkjel nesheim cut off breivik during this monologue as he &quot;breivik, did not want to give the opportunity to take advantage of this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he breivik, the speech mitbrachte, compiled an advance permission, at the end of the hearing to address the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered that the police breivik for 12 more weeks, he remains in custody, four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities will be closely monitoring all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some were able to see, in the hope that breivik in, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All took part with the aim that everything comes down to a wegschließen. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought he looks cold and inhuman,&quot; a survivor of utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster, NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it is a little Further, after I have seen and heard the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and felt throughout the hearing calmly and professionally, he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes, as he entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite breiviks bizarrem reference, it would be part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judges came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and he said that there is no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It may, for some that the attacks on 22 July, apparently the work of an individual extremists and was not that of a group of radical. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this automatically relieved the pain and confusion, the whole nation still feels? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do that,&quot; said the relatives of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, this week has been shown in a theatre </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed it technikgenie as a great modern inventors. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What apple-fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten in the recently discovered jobs-interview, which this week in particular has been filmvorführungen on the important markets entstaubt is understood, how much of the creative business head outsourcing and functioning. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a akribischer organisator, keen to diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many directors &quot;a disease of thinking&quot; suffering, &quot;a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work...&quot; but base there is a huge amount of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> 1995 developed Bob cringely tv-serie &quot;triumph of the fachidioten &apos;staff on the dawn of the computer, and he sat with jobs together longer than an hour, in which she led a rare, detailed discussions. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At this stage than 10 years have passed since jobs had been pushed from Apple, and it has already worked hard on his new computerunternehmen next, and pleased at the wide adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of cringleys interview was used in fachidioten, he says, that the kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery lacked. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Only after jobs death, there is a full vhs-kopie discovered in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly revised filmmaterial forms the basis for the 68minütigen film &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost interview&quot; this Wednesday and Thursday in the landmark-theater. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone, for which it is known that he detests Detailed interviews makes jobs are surprisingly keen in the explanation of his philosophies in technology and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly pause. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly abwägt&apos;s thoughts and tries to accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when jobs&apos; perfect days, if it seemingly impatient responded to cringelys issues and anschubst, quicker to respond to issues or nebenhandlungen of greater significance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of pixar, iPod or iPhone included, the lost interview somehow seems incredibly intelligent, if jobs valued, what other companies with him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read. posthume appreciation expressed to the career jobs&apos; But jobs here than to see the begierigen dreamer to leap to the original grandeur is something quite different, and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things could be, and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Shortly after he had said all he drew Los and made it here. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> As he learned to lead a company: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During all the years in business, I always question: &apos;Why are you doing things?,&quot; and the answer is that you always AN,: &quot;Oh, made it easy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does, and nobody in the business think really carefully about things. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I have said. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs continues his efforts, to streamline the accounting for apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Puzzled, as costs have been recorded - often began with &quot;standardkosten,&quot; which puts for mere suspicion, and were then Adapted &quot;deviation&quot; - it developed an automated factory, who ensured that the geschäftskosten until the smallest could be determined. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> As the Pope was veralbert: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs, told of the &quot;blue box,&quot; which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device that you creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls to lead free. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Enthusiasm for the device much has already been written, but jobs, as he describes the blue box as an act of selbstbemächtigung, is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how Wozniak and it would test the box by a gebührenpflichtiges telephone use a telephone call, and then a working AT &amp; t-netzwerk combine to another, while so many durchschleifen satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if you go to telephone grölte, came of it again a minute later, in telephone next door,&quot; kichernd told jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Both of us, we did n&apos;t know much, but we could build this small Ding, that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that Apple would be without them. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs told further from a glorious trick played, the Wozniak and he had withdrawn almost as you in the middle of the night via blue box in the Vatican anriefen and speak with the Pope wanted to, while Henry Kissinger nachmachten as best they could. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night herbeigerufen were to speak with the American diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he is in the technology verliebte and unprepared Bill Hewlett anrief: </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, he sought to build a frequenzzähler, according to Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after taking 20-minütigen telephone call received a teilzeitjob in Hewlett-Packard jobs for the summer. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company it was and how well his staff treated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later, jobs was one of the hp-mitarbeiter who visited the company&apos;s laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop-computer ever to be made.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with braunscher röhre and I verliebte in him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would take the HP climb upwards as a teenager and hinge on this machine and programmes for they write. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> As we improve innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview talks about jobs, as one new products erfindet spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Some platinen early in his career, when he einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the whole zusammenzubauen computers. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He worked with a delay of just 30 days and had to think through both the zusammenbau and manufacture the extradition of the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> He later in Apple recall the problems he had in the development of a computermaus: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember overwhelming arguments... you schrien me, that it would take five years to build&quot; a mouse, which would cost $300 base and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for $15, the incredible was credible. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On big companies, the slowdown: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he made apple revival saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants stumble with their vision got lost and the control of their shares. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;We say that they work in IBM or Xerox, so they make a better kopierer or printers, so what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> They do not have the aktienmonopol, so the company is more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and Marketing make it successful, &quot;Are these people having the lead the companies and the product, which pushed the people from the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The produktgenie, which has led to this monopoly, the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handwerkskunst necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox would have the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could have been ten times greater, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have caught the defeat of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as art: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is plenty of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product... if we developed this great idea, changing it and grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> We are learning a lot about its subtleties. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> It must be votes to certain things that you ca n&apos;t, but pair electrons, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> 5,000 things we must find these concepts, and all of them together... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Ultimately, it amounts to taste, it is that you are trying to address with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these things together, what you do. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of what made the Macintosh great, was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, zoologen, historians, which happens to be the best computer scientists in the world are common. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It would have been not the computer, they would create fantastic things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia adopts and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the gesundheitsgesetze, a court case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day, in which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the teilende political issue, whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama&apos;s gesundheitsgesetze, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, at dinner, the practice has been gesponsort, that will take the case to court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting, to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases handled was a complaint, the 26 states have risen up against the broad reform of health care, which were agreed by Congress last year, a law that was the slogan in the conservative activists across the United States. </seg>

<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts by $600 trillion or more will be necessary, if Congress can not reach a conclusion in the spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said a failure of Congress in reaching an budgetvereinbarung, which will lead to the seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a large cut, carried out on such unthinking way that would make the most of our shipping and construction unworkable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisierungsbemühungen severely damaged,&quot; Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We were also forced to involuntarily separated from a large part of our civilian staff to and, because the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly beurlauben civilians, in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our concentration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts were ultimately make the combat troops, &quot;said Panetta. </seg>

<seg id="1765"> &quot;The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United are providing and their defence should not be allowed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will strengthen demands, exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta increasingly outspoken the possibility of cuts, even though it many years has experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the Pentagon&apos;s top, and knows that he faces tough choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense malte might face a bleak picture, which - with a military shell, but without a core. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is a luftwaffengeschwader without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission,&quot; said Panetta in his inaugural address in the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force that lacks morals and concentration is and is not in a position to start it with potential opponents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;It is a really angry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details, such as Reductions &quot;creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, our global operational and eingreiffähigkeit serious restrictions which leads to an unacceptable risk in future kriegsoperationen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the largest verteidigungsprojekte could fall victim to the removal, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> To this list also includes the fighter pilots f35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new bodenkampffahrzeug, the army and navy, need to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> It would stop the further development and testing of the f35, it would save up to $80 billion over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step in arming, so that risks posed by China and other opponents can be overcome. </seg>

<seg id="1782"> The leadership of Penh State is accused of meineids because they allegedly reports that a retired footballtrainer Young had been sexually abused. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the past week, on an open microphone mitangehört, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to the US President, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shaking countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool, when he verleugnungen in circulation, which were very quickly disproved by incontrovertible evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards accused of violations in the kampagnenfinanzierung, in connection with the secrecy of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, of course, no one has seen it forgets that caused the media circus that President Bill Clinton during his second term in Oval Office, when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories about also in the school and college-prüfungen are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been incidents in which teachers set their students prüfungsantworten have dastanden so that they are themselves in their leistungsüberprüfungen well. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors to teach the opposite should send a message that lies and also OK. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> We see how much deception? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> As studies show, we lies between 10 and 200 times every day. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> But, as notlügen apply many of these lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that foreign each other three times in the First 10 minutes of a meeting lie. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Uncover lies to recognise or &quot;lies&quot; to learn is one that is important for everyone, both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlor game such as scharaden, the aim is to &quot;property, to call you!&quot; is the enttarnen of deception, a serious wissensbereich, based on scientific data, collected in the course of the past six decades of prestigious universities, which had extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> A result of this research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been revealed. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies look in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They stottern stammeln erröten and zappeln not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> This, we can not conclude that this liar are difficult to detect and enttarnen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A geübter lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth to something about the structure of the claim that the fine gesichtsausdrücke, learn about issues and timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have spent several years, the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing pool of enttarnung to investigate, and it is clear that the enttarnen deception is a modern ability, it is easy to learn and helps us cope in our complex in the world, especially if the stop or the question of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liar are very good to inspire other people to their interests and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively, how they are perceived by others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people more than introvertierte people lies, &quot;selbstorientierte&quot; lies presented that men more often than women, whose lies &quot;to follow other&quot; more - in the rule, they want to protect the feelings of others, that married people of their partner anlügen less often than unmarried people - but the lies they tell, are mostly &quot;Fats lies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed, others feel less guilty, this person angelogen. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> As is, whether someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First of all, by watching the normal behaviour of that person. </seg>

<seg id="1811"> They should know better, when someone normally keep with the foot trippelt, so that they are not wrong to accuse him, if he trippelt during a meetings with the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then they pay attention to anhäufungen striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> They consider this anhäufungen alarm bells, the strident, not as evidence of a enttarnung. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who fooled, freeze, perhaps, if you try to recall their history. Perhaps, their feet in the door and they are in the direction of outcome, change their position in a significant way, or show a &quot;relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch,&quot; this deep, entspannende ausatmen and the change in the attitude that if all the hard questions are over. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Fragende often wrongly indicate that a einstellungsgespräch is over, only to keep looking for this relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> They also pay attention to the language of their versuchsperson. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The lapse of Scott Peterson is famous, when he vergangenheitsform used when he claimed that his wife killed is still alive and triggered a national search for her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceptive individuals can also use a distanzierende language: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or, if you knifflige question in the whole again. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &quot;qualifizierende language&quot; when they answer knifflige question: &quot;Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... with a good conscience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This will be the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which is often the alarm bells. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no zaubermittel to enttarnen lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to them enttarnung possible. </seg>

<seg id="2087"> The way in which we are grown, has made it easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We are safe, not too often tournee, because it is too easy to love this game with huge crowds your music, to lapse. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> Until you consider that the people are because of the music here, reminds you this because the music and what it has created, eighth must, without intent to be a famous rockstar. This has never interested anyway. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> What memories you have on your other project mother love bone? </seg>

<seg id="2099"> That is a question for ED - Eddie vedder, I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He is, and I believe that is the first that occurs to him. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Wurdest you as a bassist influenced by whom? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> By so many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first, which I thought, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many throughout the afternoon, I could talk about the bassisten liked,. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> As Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, even though there is no longer a modeerscheinung? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, the bands strike me, which I have mentioned, for example, mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who were raised at the same time, if they are still important, I think it is great, because it is good to hear this music and bands as mudhoney better music now than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of song on the new album, the somewhat lightly could work, but there are other songs such as the end or just breathe, considered very dark song, although they have something positive in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> On both came to me in tears when I heard Ed they played, and it is very dark song. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happens in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your artistic creation and your music and these two song represent clear for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> However, I also believe that you be a happier person and still dark music. </seg>

<seg id="2181"> The President of the PP Mr Partido Popular - People&apos;s Party in the city had taken, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for immediate areas of the building and the problems of civil coexistence, as well as the stadtviertels come down in the control. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> He said that before the summer just a floor of the building was occupied, but that the hausbesetzer in the last few months in all Etagen got the building and almost all homes; some were even come to theft. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense, he added, that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to impunity and against the asozialen acts in the building down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday was another building in the districts nou Barris cleared from the katalonischen police. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 3.30 p.m. näherte police the streets montral No 35, after she had received a call from a neighbor who had watched as four people wanted to enter the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four were immediately arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees in favour of the tender. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of collserola again in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the 1980s, the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona, CMB, this administration published its schmähschrift on the promotion of collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a huge park city in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was even in figures compared with New York&apos;s Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in nord-süd-richtung spread, but upwards of mountains and down to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification collserolas as National Park to play with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Served as model is no longer the central park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far, it was in September, when the city a riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 to competitions, for further zugangstore after collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a parks. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone has gates to country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is: collserola park or mountain itself? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The tender is not only from organisational point of view, but also in terms of the debate in the mouths of a reflection on the city of architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a rekurrentes subject on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who are meeting in the lift up resort. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this very fact provides fodder for one of the rare matches between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel roldán Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> It is necessary for roldán ,&quot;&quot; according to the attack on the coast on the &quot;Front On mountains to talk about&quot; if the discourse of ildefons CERDA, on the green apples, has not been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;You should start from the principle that is taken extremely Park beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is complex, &quot;Judgments of the architect, for the title of&quot; gates of collserola &quot;an&quot; impressive event is: &quot;You should not&quot; be access to a park to imagine, but as narrowing of areas where action is needed. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, such as roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge,&quot; the &quot;inherent in a number of dangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers as a result of the &quot;uncertainty and the creation of a public space today with the situation&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum had their &quot;swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is its own limit to what can be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limit always means something to determine the next step,&quot; i.e., to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We need to think about new urban planning instruments because the current&quot; regarding the general plan metropolitano - PGM base can lead to a real disaster. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol, close to the question of the simplified, believes the side of collserola, in the direction of vallesana &quot;can not be understood as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, for purely topografischen reasons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol, pointed out that there is already a study by patronat de collserola should not &quot;fall on deaf ears,&quot; even though he was grateful to the city council that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project, &quot;from the first moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, he notes that the proximity of the city in the geleitbrief is gebirges, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although it expresses his &quot;Doubt&quot; Whether this technical profile multidisciplinary team launched the &apos;right&apos;, he says, &quot;We should give - Guidance to architects should only be a tool.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona implies that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as has in the tender conditions of collserola lack a global vision: &quot;There have been 16 competitions in of advertised,&quot; he says, &quot;the axis gebirge-meer. But there is no längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> It has, at least in his case meant that he participates in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, would the programme and the definition of a project for a goal of the architects of The ToRs then colliding. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> His view that the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length as required, the soft transition between city and grünzonen emerge. </seg>

<seg id="2257"> Verstreuung of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information until now indicate that the helicopter was from gerader and seitlicher direction aufgeprallt. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of flugzeugreste now suggest that the helicopter with its unversehrten structure aufgeprallt was on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No sign of fire or explosion: </seg>

<seg id="2268"> You Social Security Fund Mexico leads to a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by the IPN specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro social - IMSS - Social Security Fund Mexico announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title &quot;genetics of obesity in childhood and youth&quot; is, with the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación médica en bioquímica - Department for medical research, focus Biochemie - to the clinic hospital de especialidades del centro médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that a interdisziplinäres team, consisting of doctors, krankenpflegern, ernährungsspezialisten and social workers was built. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team will be supported by specialists and students from the postgraduiertenstudiengangs on Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública - Insp - and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios avanzados - cinvestav del Instituto politécnico Nacional in IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can come to Sports of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 p.m. carried out tests on children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation at the sportplatz Cuauhtémoc - in west of the state of México - began in the sportplatz of nezahualcóyolt, and since the October 8 in the east of the state of México will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the target of 500 to 600 untersuchungspersonen is reached, the study will have the sportplatz of Independencia, in the south of the hauptstadtbezirks continued and on the Morelos, in the north of the hauptstadtbezirks concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the World Day of diabetes, he said it is going to three thousand children and young people under the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors that could lead to diabetes or niereninsuffizienz, to control. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He also that in these samstagen led the untersuchungspersonen, weight, size, taillenumfang, measured their blood pressure controlled, and blutwerte as the glukosespiegel, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors - attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity were determined. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López stressed that investigation would at the concerns of the health workers conducted on the alarming weight gain of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the proportion of obese boys by 77%, and the girls with obesity have increased by 47% and obesity has increased dramatically,&quot; the specialist of the IMSS stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He was, the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico from the other peoples differences. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It was that A - E - Mexicans - in - on average to indianisch-amerikanischer, 65 per cent to 5 per cent to 30 per cent of European and African descent is what is in the genes, which are associated with diabetes and obesity reflects. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> In general, he said, the genetics of obesity am in the inability to put the surplus of US Energy - calories to burn, so this will be stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers said that the direct benefits for the put research participants is a comprehensive study of the children, found in the dignity, whether it is a degree of obesity or obesity showed. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would even the dark hautfalten occur in the nacken and innenarm - akanthosis, which highlight the likelihood of stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes in the preliminary stage, is investigating. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All of the information would be kept confidential and explain to the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors told the parents of all the values of and are proposing changes to the way of life to you, the prevention of diseases are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors, which are responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: exercise, which means a lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day on the television and transport short routes to go on foot to be used instead. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high kalorienaufnahme, which means that increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and kohlenhydraten - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc. - combined with a High fat and eiweißaufnahme and genetics to be analysed in this project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM schlaglöcher prevented </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with polymeren modified asphalte, in order to make the mix of robust to weather and temperature fluctuations </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Would be on the sign, which come from the straßenbelag, respected, there would be no need to repair Nearly 200 000 schlaglöcher, when the rainy season zona Metropolitana del Valle de México - stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico - erupts, said Rafael Herrera nájera, researchers at the university&apos;s school of chemistry, FQ to UNAM, warning and assured that if the interpretations and the maintenance of asphaltbelags properly happen, the number of schlaglöcher significantly reduced or avoided altogether. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture &quot;from a technical point of view,&quot; he schlaglöcher held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymeren modified asphalte developing in order to establish a similar mix asphalt, but more mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures in. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera nájera, said that this type of modified asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and, therefore, to avoid the appearance of schlaglöchern. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He stated that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - is a kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, part of which has a high molekulargewicht - so asphaltene mentioned - and the other part of a low - the &apos;malthene. Together, they give the straßenbelag his characteristic zähelastisches behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Zähelastisches behaviour of the asphalts means that this is how a liquid is at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it is very zähflüssig at 120 degrees and 50 ° C almost note, while it is crumbling at extremely low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;This means that the strength of the asphalts on the streets is not gleichförmig, but on a day depending on the weather and temperature fluctuations change &apos;, led the chemieingenieur. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The majority of the FQ researchers noted, the streets of Mexico City have a flexible straßenbelag of six materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt included. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the top layers is a verschleißschicht asphalt, from small, insisting in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single piece of this verschleißschicht, had been in asphalt gebadet. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles travel and forces, will allow this class creates a good kräfteverteilung in straßenbelag. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better,&quot; said the chemieingenieur. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot;Over the verschleißschicht interpreted,&quot; he led, &quot;will be a last layer, known as the tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which has also been in asphalt gebadet. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Because of this shift in contact with the tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the verschleißschicht and it must produce friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> The straßenbelag receives the majority of forces and distributed to the tragschicht also needs a proper thick and the material from which it is, must be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather conditions in particular, humidity and temperature changes, further, important factors to be taken into consideration, and above all the water, &quot;he said,&quot; because it affects the behaviour of the verschleißschicht significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the site is wet, filthy water again in the class and is just difficult. That causes a relaxation of all sections of the surface and as a result, the incidence of schlaglöchern. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> When a schlagloch emerge, &quot;he said,&quot; First of all, the deckschicht abgetragen affected, while the verschleißschicht then, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first signs by adequate wartungsprogramme should be maintained. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member in sistema nacional de Investigadores - system of national innovation of Mexico - said that the fahrzeuglast another important reason for the emergence of schlaglöchern is, so must the thickness of each layer on the surface are always in relation to fahrzeuglast and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent schlaglöchern this arrangement will be adhered to. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research on would wait to in other countries, even on asphaltemulsionen, for example, are already on the market, and with which the schlaglöcher simply and without use of high temperatures could fix. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> Del Valle, which lacked the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors playing around the fact that Melina Ramírez serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle gets its 14 misstitel. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the Crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time was Melina Ramírez serna content, on to the gewinnerpodium, a silberkrone and demonstrated the bond that you as the new Miss Colombia, for show. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> In Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico with the result that night received the Crown and the zeder in itself, is the Departamento on 14 misstitel and Melina joining the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had kept the crown almost in the hands. misses include: Miriam ospina proclaimed to the Benoit, 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero - 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala, 1979, Lorena Alvarez, of 1981, Rose Mary alzate of 1983, Olga María arenas - 1987, Leila blanque - 1988 - Mónica Evers - 1989, María Consuela Pinedo - 1990, Diana Isabel Romero 1993, Giselle Garcés aljure - 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question today, many are asking is: what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is the demise of a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to make the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain to Queen of the police and the mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, title, including the schönheitsköniginnen taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor, which is regarded as crucial for the jury&apos;s decision to appoint the first Miss, is that it has the answer to the question &quot;What book you most and why?,&quot; which affects their Martín Murillo Gómez from the carreta literaria leamos had been raised, was not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman in Valle del Cauca replied to the author: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I think quite the literature, I believe it is a way to civilise, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, &apos;der small Prince &apos;, a deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Today, I read&apos;schuld and Punishment, &quot;and it is a book of universal culture that we all should read, I read a book by Irene nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, The&apos;leidenschaften &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> One MET with little gegenliebe, firstly because of&apos;sich civilise &apos;and, secondly, because they do not have a real, had declared how each of her book she had influenced. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the outcome: &quot;The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people, read a bit&apos;den please small prince, &quot;and it is a great book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle ausgebrannt. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the favourite, all of which beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices, gastronomie-wettbewerb OSTER, publikumsabstimmung the best handgeschneiderte kostüm and Reina Madre, &quot;had made the other candidates jealous, is what the Queen stresste and therefore could not shine on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it said its first presentation to the swimming suit on the beach of the hilton-hotels and their two lifts in the krönungsfeier. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although they appeared in two sure, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme &quot;Como en Casa,&quot; the channel RCN argued that the fact that Melina on has been crowned Miss, &quot;shows that the candidate during the competition, the most of the prices not queen wins, after all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Valle was also out of the way - a mistake at the end of the press. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle, the jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not convince the essentials of the National schönheitswettbewerbs. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It will have its reason for two days before the creation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty said they were a woman, the dedication to their country&apos;s Social Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia; you have on the physical hinausschauen and focus on the social experience, that is to say, that they had worked on projects before participating in the competition,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is also speculation that Valle, with its defects of the derriere and fibrosis, be it in the magengegend said, had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for&apos;natürliche beauty &apos;with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts About dogmas should prevail </seg>
<seg id="2678"> An issue that does not exist can be dealt with on the basis of short stories or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and cost of electricity in direct maβe influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take a wahltreffen for a reason to think about this issue, as well as on the position of the nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only bear fruit if they explored the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should your opinion on objective facts, rational data fundieren. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although there are 7 billion people on the planet, is the demographic evolution forward a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, should not be deprived of a vital element a huge share of the world&apos;s population. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time the scarcity of fossil resources must be reversed, in order to continue to consistently produce electricity, without the pressing need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, from the environmental debate verschwundenes, to forget, to combat climate unregelmäβigkeiten. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> None of these parameters changed the Fukushima accident. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case in Belgium, its decision in the need for substitutionsfähige ersatzquelle intends to find, still in Switzerland, the time, the last generation to build nuclear power plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states, continue to pursue their Projects against with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States itself after Fukushima have decided that their anzugliedern park a further unity by the following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident decommissioned work again in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Even if the aimed at renewable energy sources, German Model is sometimes as an example, the reality is, however, the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in elektrizitätspreises, strengthened by the increased use of importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, reflected an increase of being caused by gas and coal plants CO2 emissions. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The sum of these unfortunate effects will be already felt within a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark gives pause for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is in one of European tabellenführer about wind energy from the 30% of its electricity is, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used it in turns with wind power, which are his co2-ausstösse and elektrizitätspreis by 65%, respectively, and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% more elektrizitätsrechnung. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> As the price of energy, a key role of competitiveness in the global economy and a stabilitätspfand industry at the national soil, the French companies have an advantage because the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in energiepreises, therefore, what our country&apos;s noble comments on the reindustrialisierung and the defence of Liesse purchasing power to the illusion. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Polls showed that the price of being groβe majority of the French nor is prepared to pay demonstrates, as opposition to the principle of this source of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We remember that our nation&apos;s energy policy has made it possible, an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 build induzierten jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Because of their strong exportcharakters brings with it a host of specialised small and small enterprises on the international markets and makes the creators of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power, which groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros in investitionsgüter- and kernenergieexport would be more and more zusammenschrumpfen. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What elektriker would to work on 60 years is designed EPR mandating the decline of its producers, if inevitable? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are as little as a teufelswerk is a panacea for the production of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The company Areva developed low carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> To maintain the highest level of security for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have a security agency, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the building in flamanville manner. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The arbeitsteams, which, because of their professionalism, the sicherheitsvorstellung have just made a name to mad. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one in Three Mile Island is happened under normal operating conditions; he was without consequences for people and the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl, the drama was created by reaktorkonstruktion and unendschuldbares, human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry is their lessons and learn from this accident, as it had done after the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a result of this course of action and cooperation of the intelligence agencies of the French and German industrialists and operators of nuclear power plants, the EPR a draft to its resistance to such things. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> As it is considered among the elektrotechnikern and desirable to build a nuclear power station, would be a freeze in flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by giving them free rein Liesse, the leadership in the inevitable kernkraftentwicklung to reissen. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and parteimanöber dominate debate, which also been economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Of Nicolas Sarkozy, the immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to the figures submissive policy, the reconciliation of this policy with the status of a &quot;country of human rights,&quot; such as France had call themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently had the harassment directed at foreign students of administrative side, the Interior Minister had marked the wochenschauen incidental - see Libération on 23 May - announced that France &quot;have no talent, bricklayers or waiter from abroad need.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was seldom analysis from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> From right side was the stance of Jacques Chirac, 1976, had declared that &quot;900, 000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrierte labour, no problem for a country should be&quot; left side by Michel Rocard, 1990, had said France &quot;could not include the whole of poverty in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> One difference is the level of groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005, both from the right and from the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the extent of the groβzügigkeit, one for immigrants is willing to admit. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande is limited in his program on banalities that point out, partnership development, we want our &apos;migration problems to solve. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This vision of immigration as a burden, as a problem, however, may affect the elections; it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As all the economists Ian aware of Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which summarises the latest findings on immigration, exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S., exists below the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the einwandererflut on economic growth, wages and jobs in the destination. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limit immigration would deny and damage the employment market growth. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified to replaced, by putting pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Experience shows, however, that in fact the immigrants are much complementary than the local lohnarbeiter, as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors to the arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low skilled immigrants working in sectors, domestic lohnarbeiter put little charms, the higher quality among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the arbeitsangebot aligned. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive lohneffekt </seg>
<seg id="2734"> A surgeon would have problems, as well as to work in a country, where there is a lack of anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants, so is a positive effect of einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic employment situation. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni peri, calculated in this way, a 1% -iger in the einwandererflut a miteinbezogene, long term increase in wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and is conducive to the economic growth - a high proportion naturalized immigrants from under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants also have net the systems, in European countries, on average for a total amount of 1% of the entire budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The weltarbeitsorganisation estimates, for example, that a einwandernde person the public budget to Germany at the age of 30 years on average, his life is a net contribution brings in revenue minus expenditure of about 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of schnittpunkte bring about &quot;with the teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> This said teeth, which would shock the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, now is to rethink the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset, also a delicate thing. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Of the European continent should remind themselves, who after its invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the whole of the 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, the holocaustes Franco, of the Gulag, but also in Spain, salazars in Portugal and the supreme in Greece had put on. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> No doubt some had thought it enough to exercise the right to vote, direktest on way to the triumph of the democracy on its enemies once and for all to see. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know since Napoleon &quot;small&quot; that it was a feature of the spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient condition and may well become &quot;a unterdrückungsinstrument,&quot; as it was Republican philosopher Etienne vacherot said. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation that separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social spirit that jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost political and crisis of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The change of attitude of the Greek wahr-falsch-referendums had twice insightful character in this respect: even the need for a strong return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of disturbing sense of the impossibility of their unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is, that have shifted the front lines of the Democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer are moving in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, to push for success of the national referendum, which depending on the needs and perverse order has been organised. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A freischein for European absolute or a leap with the eyes in the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want hackebeil, but a collective responsibility, quite rightly, clear and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know the rest of not even more, where the list to end - there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe, which is bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from his impotence and solidaritätsmangel. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe, it is humiliated at international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> They are worried about souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so each of the angegliederten Nations him. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is that the sovereignty to give back to the leadership of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is located on the set, whether the Europeans, to reduce the burden of their debts and looking at a future investment can open markets. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis at European level decisions on the condition, which can not be taken without total democratic rechtmäβigkeit, without quite sure to destruction. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal has been fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time about, is this any European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> I agree. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But this without political integration and greater democracy - how the citizens want - to would be folly and further deadlock again. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We need to take a new stage of European integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In France, in the Republic of being, it took the fact that republicans to &quot;create.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of interests alone could not do enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to form an integrated Europe better on the economic level. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe creates a truly European sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We need to create Europeans to Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2835"> On China, Iran and the israel-hilfe fall - often in no way has underpinned - slogans. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Of the about the appointment of the &quot;Grand old party&quot; can Mitt Romney threatened the most valued Chinese quote to the WTO, and the &quot;currency manipulation&quot; - leading issue in America, by the exodus of entire industries to Asia to äuβerste gereizt - accuse. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Gone stupid if this should lead to the introduction of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama, and one candidate who seems to have a mature vision of auβenpolitik, has nearly about his emotions schmeichelnden conduct of the air abgeschnürt. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He had called for a robust but constructive gesprächsaustausch with Beijing - also Obama&apos;s current position. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman will not heard, because in the depths of the opinion polls, he stops. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Reagan&apos;s image </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney also had military strikes against Iran, if the sanctions to stoppung praised the nuklearprogrammes should fail. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, areas I had the Iran stop,&quot; he getönt. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;Obama is reelected, you get the Bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Auβerdem, he has promised to help Israel increased military and Obama accused commitments to have been guilty of this partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The entrepreneur Herman Cain zweithöchst platzierter candidate, is itself a shameful aktenunkenntnis for show. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently he called for, to give the Chinese militärbedrohung versus that Beijing &quot;attempts to develop a nuclear&quot; - and seemed auβer account of the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military atomarwaffen. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, äuβert itself, to be prepared, in Mexico against drug cartels in the American army service. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Obama the 2009 banned use of foltermaβnahmen to mutmaβlichen terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and kandidation Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> The current präsidentschaftskontrahenten to Reagan, too, was simple ideas and had nevertheless won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They call in the memory, that Obama was selbstein amateur and water had to pay on the subject of anti-terrorist was in his wine. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve, zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his &quot;Boys&quot; from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he also moved the reputation of the weakness. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But this anfeindung is not quite so ungezwungen. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population estimates more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, bin Laden has eliminated. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, has been put into operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It is designed to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian gasriese Gazprom wanted to make this event with glamour and Gloria. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Loaded more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, orchesterbeschallung and feinschmeckerbuffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Mrs Merkel the German Chancellor, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister, François Fillon, and his counterpart mark rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together the steering wheel of the ventils films, which Russian gas transported to Western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first of 1.224 km pipeline, linking the St. Petersburg region with Pomerania, delivered to Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipeline, a gesamtlieferung from 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total - allowed, should be completed in the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And it is already the eventuality of the construction of a third leadership to distance ourselves full capacity. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge bauwerkes as a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project has been highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in order to prevent any trassenverlaufs through third countries - Poland or Ukraine on the land transit. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason, these two countries lose some of its power, it will now be more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia to contract by threatening access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a &quot;new deutsch-sowietischen Pact&quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, to compare the occupation of Poland in the years 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the subject of äuβerst politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> This, however, at the expense of entkräftung European energy, because the project has beaten a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has it ready in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gasverbrauche and their gas tend to go through. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterie that unites us in organic way,&quot; François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gasverträge are also important from a political and economic side. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smile of the gazprom-manager in lubmin many on the gaszuleitung. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of the gas pipeline is also a prominent technology. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The unterwasserleitung consists of steel with betonummantelung to protect them from schiffsankern. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the seabed, in roughly 200 metres deep. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Their construction needed to datierenden minefields be avoided from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;around there were hundreds of mines had to be cautiously removed or destroyed,&quot; Jens Müller, Nord Stream, spokesman of the society. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Auβerdem increased maβnahmen had to be taken to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The line is a long queue of metal, eiffeltürme difficult as 242, which is more than the entire length interrupted by nothing: neither by outlets, wartungsstationen. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden is planned, but the project developers distance yourself from it, as the Swedes have little were keen, a Russian staatsgesellschaft in a permanent way to size of their coasts to settle. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the event of an accident contract we gasdurchlass, Jens refined Müller in less than one minute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak entweicht the gas in the air that is in the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is konstrukteuren than just considered unlikely, however, as the schweiβnähte was estimated at a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Monitoring by the state of the pipeline will be guaranteed by a unterwasser-roboter to external observationszwecken seeschiff frame, as well as by circulating a device in the heart of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the form of zigarre, miβt introduced a metre diameter, the home of the pipeline and moved on from the gasdruck. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three full days of movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, is the device in his arrival of detailed information on possible deformationen of metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to work for 50 years, without the slightest to undergo repairs. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gaszirkulation will simply guaranteed under pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This is 200 bar in the zutritts- 100 bar in the austrittsstelle. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies combine their efforts to implement this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Here the German companies are also attached to E. on and BASF, as ever, be 15,5%, as well as the Dutch gasunie and the French firmengruppe GDF Suez - ever to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have formed an unternehmensgemeinschaft, called the Nord Stream and which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It also has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Then this society the entire capacity of their gastransportes Gazprom has hired out together on renewable zwanzig-jahres-vertrag. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the capacity, regardless of how groβ real transportiere, Jens refined Müller is gasmenge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and to 70% covered by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The cost of Labour as a whole should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> However, the minority shareholders are gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability has been transferred. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas pipeline is on a sandy, with kiefern wooded küstenstrich lubmin from the Baltic Sea to light. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5 metres high are the gasaustrittspforte outlets. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, before this is conveyed in the German gasfernleitungen who arrive. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday of the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per verstreichende hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, and 6 million in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a markennotizbuch. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created by an Italian company about 15 years ago, moleskine would like to restore new style to the letter. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has a flair adventure in kerzenschein zugebrachte hours with the letter. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notizbuch of moleskine is easily visible again, with its black, rechteckigen cover his elastic, the eierschalfarbenen sides, such as the time aged. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> The moleskine notizbuch, as we know it today is, however, created in 1997. </seg>

<seg id="2919"> This type of notizbuch was much in demand among writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten the subject as icon avantgardistischer, until the 20th century artists,&quot; Maria sebregondi explained, was now markenverantwortliche In modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish a paragraph of 12.7 million slice. </seg>

<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to produce a phantombild of buyers since the notizbuch, businessmen, as well as students and professionals enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and offengeistiger customers. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small, Italian companies, which was in its infancy 12 staff, today employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York. </seg>

<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the spirit and his new schreibbedarf, despite the recovery of the emails,&quot; said Maria sebregondi. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate remains disabled professionals at such high levels? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people to search for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today, the 15th week of the work for the disabled. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a determined öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has been twice as high as the average average: arbeitlosigkeit 19% to 9% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, Éric stressed Blanchet, Director General of the Association of adapt, the&quot; week of work for the disabled &quot;liberal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made in 15 years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;Then twice, but three times the rate of unemployment was not as high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to be done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It has to be said, however, that for disabled unemployed continue to exist many obstacles before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Often it is the Elderly: 37% are older than 50 years - 17% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> You have a low level of skill: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled from 38% in gesamtschnitt. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, there are so many criteria, a new arbeitseinstieg difficult, and the &quot;heart of the problem,&quot; said Christian grapin, Director General of tremplin, a group founded in 1992, is to help the company recruit disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the factual brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Is the unspoken, the mentalities, certainly, but slowly develop. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> In April, a study carried out by the Association of ims-entreprendre for the magazine La Cité, the managers surveyed have had &quot;a bit of kenntnisniveau with disabled,&quot; the &quot;in&quot; is &quot;payable by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually minderbemittelten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the anstellungsziel of 6% disabled workers, which has been enshrined in law from 1987 to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now at about 3%,&quot; Pierre Blanc, Director General of AGEFIPH reported that the organization, which it is to collect contributions from companies that violate this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof is that the number of &quot;charges zahlender &apos;plants, as well as the amount of personal amounts between 2007 and 2011, and zahlenmäβig 59.000 reduced to 46.000 - and 606 to 480 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The 2005 law, which provides for employed, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement is also a real insight in the groβen firmengruppen expressed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of work employ only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 staff against 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What kind of happiness&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to look forward,&quot; assured the native liller itself. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> With regard to the contrast between his presentation in the club and nationalelf &quot;It is an entity that justifies everything.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a good job,&quot; he said enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, according to the technicians well the plane with the blue - the French nationalelf - parts... and direction of Brazil in 2014. </seg>
