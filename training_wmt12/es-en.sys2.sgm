<seg id="21"> The only justification was that, from their point of view, not the NATO attacks targeted a US general, But Allah is great, whose greatness held after each of the successful interventions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When finding winners in Libya, the West is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We are stuck in a shooting of using the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, do not Libya militarily. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this case, the locals are not is a problem driving the &apos;crusaders&apos; </seg>
<seg id="26"> But, no occupation will manage the Libyan oil be with the black gold only with good words? </seg>

<seg id="83"> In the families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which applies to most of the current families where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time to exercise. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey to 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same basic education almost 900 children across the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Was already the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot; program, which supports the general health insurance company and the Unilever company. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Until now, they have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children from the fourth to the 8th place. </seg>
<seg id="88"> A proper diet and exercise enough in family are determining factors, which are reducing significantly the number of overweight children and even obesity. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the children surveyed have responded with five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, dinner, merienda and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; contains one of the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast but with embutido for dinner </seg>

<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of the families of desayunan school at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families, each desayuna alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> But the worst thing was to discover that nothing is desayuna at 10% of homes. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is right, however, the basis of a daily allowance. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The study shows that in the families of Obese children are consumed much more often the drink chips. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost all - regardless of weight - sweet drink daily drinks 70%. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Generally make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Fabrícate your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> The next phase of the study accommodated the elected chavales - 204 172 girls and boys of 13 schools - was created their own allowances from every possible bids according to their tastes and opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among his pet food are pasta, meat and sweets </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet drinks,&quot; is in the final report of the study warned. </seg>
<seg id="104"> As the main food takes the biscuit pasta and follows closely the poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Practically, the children always reject the legumbre and a taste for the fish and vegetables is very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Change to healthy habits </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the study shows that children are prepared to change their eating habits if they receive the information fair. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;in the control group of the participants in the study, which completed the questionnaire after ending the obesity prevention program&quot; is not a coincidence, &quot;was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of a healthy diet,&quot; noted in the study results. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Draws attention, for example, regards the sweet drinks, where many children begin to prefer the normal water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children also would choose more often in the main questionnaire poultry meat and fish for food and they would restrict the consumption of fresh food and derivatives of flour. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The estilista also has to be a good psychologist, argue the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article, how I did learn the estilistas, already complain a little of that initial lessons were already quite charged. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea of how to run things. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Three professional conferences in the industry - how problematic clothe characters and, moreover, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment industry. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer are the final exams, more information and practical tasks ahead </seg>
<seg id="117"> And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, is no longer a PIN. </seg>
<seg id="118"> We are and we have looked at Alena, the director - there is no man in the course - on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And that is the great majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a estilizada figure without the right curves and someone is overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The estilista have to soften ópticamente a broad shoulders, extending a neck or recreate the Phillips needed </seg>
<seg id="122"> Have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body type of Jennifer women&apos;s breasts and caderas huge but close care first, and at the same time vestirla in a way not too challenging </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between the care and the caderas is such that the skirt or trousers do not adapt, continued worth be patching at least an extra piece of cloth to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly will not regret, because the clothes that feels perfectly is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a skirt to measure will feel much better than one that is constantly moving, upheaval, danced in the care, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The body estilizado can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, bordados or drapeados. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to bring order in my mind all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And even then, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than adequately. </seg>
<seg id="129"> To each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, who must devise two vestuarios: one for the day and another for the night. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We need to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that is appropriate to the person in question. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I have covered &quot;dress&quot; to Miranda Kerr, perhaps the conozcáis&apos;s Secret victory of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Cry inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which have gained weight recently about 100 kilograms - please take into account the hype - or the jovencísima Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes have to recortarlos magazines or found on the Internet and imprimirlos, to then produce these graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The result is the moodboard, which is as complete, expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is important also to think about the graphic part of the estilismo. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The estilista, therefore, wears not only physically, but also include, for example, in the pages of products in the magazines - from specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="137"> This told us of the estilista and designer Mario kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But all this is already for Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The estilista must have a global vision. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three guests specialists animated the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The estilista Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub polanka and the fashion photographer Ben renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the estilista should saberle capitalise on this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a good estilista can work with the same item of clothing in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability, in this case, is essential. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As well, such gabardina - or as they say in English, trench-coat - classic you can wear it with jeans and shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with tacón shoes and fotografiarlo as if it were in fact a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just arremangarla and boarded the neck to get a completely different picture. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;jugad with it &apos;, we insisted. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What I most is the next Council: &quot;I need to start working, first conozcáis all the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then we can romperlas,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally it is clear why memorizamos all these formulas, which is combined with what, why, if we find that we are in the fashion magazines different results. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention of the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a estilista must have more types of clothes in the reserve aims to the state. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So, for a fashion history that has ten pages - therefore, ten outfits - must be prepared, ready for use at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the photos clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> All this must be taken into account when designing the Outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half the success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the world márquetin have made her a star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of the estilistas. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Until those famous people are useless - it is my skills, physical aspect is not so important. </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when people ask us for our services, we have to bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a very different size to his real - less. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then it just guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain fame has gained weight / adelgazado, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> On Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the estilista is not enough focus on fashion, but needs to understand outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During their work, especially must communicate with the people that wears, so it is essential to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Valuing people know, there is no less, defends his views. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager you recruited to clasifiquéis costumes and it completéis with fine clothes, you can not catch and throw everything they had and say: &apos;Huy what horror.&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;encontrad at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend for that someone can get,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us that everything should be on the &apos;placovka&apos;, that is, the bag of work. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is set around the care and there are all the necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Are objects as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There are also nailon thread - that it serves the estilista during the session on photos of products such as handbags or caps, pinzas enganche special clothing ahead, if this were higher - the alfileres and other types of enganches are not allowed, as could damage the fabric - or a game at all. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Not to stand in the passive listening and put something in place, we have learned of the suela shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in a flat surface, it could damage the suela and much more still outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And we did more than take and take. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not touch the shoes with scissors to avoid damaging by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So we had to be very subtle. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me an unqualified joy in praising my work. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that I can not give very well these skills. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small part of all those who have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> As I realised that commit to estilismo at professional level is not a path of pink, but gives me exactly like what people say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Competes in Need for Speed: the run across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Overview </seg>
<seg id="181"> A casual journey, in principle, is complicated by a number of improper neglect of a routine trip during voting tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="182"> To some extent it did meet the expectations, but that does not help, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new delivery, to which the title is added the run, sparked great expectations even before its premiere. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Promised to give the former New Aires saga of careers Need for Speed and, following the show, appears as a game that should not end up again a genre without further action. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character drops from car and walk on their own feet. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As usual in the series of NFS, the results do not vary greatly from what we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are races that can be taken by the total count is acceptable, but in absurd lose points because of failures, which have already appearing in the series for years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> In reality can not be or call errors incomprehensible, but rather is about the unwillingness of the programmers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are being introduced in a story, whose hero, Jack has some personal problems; to resolve them, he offers participating in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sentáis behind the wheel on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is the first to reach New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer something interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten stages and, then, in more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It follows from this that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> In that way, you do not have anywhere near the feeling that the game always offers the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the areas are even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to previous deliveries of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produced a very pleasant visual effect. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Moreover, the careers are from time to time by a diversified atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> So, for example, in the desert you encontráis a storm of sand that diminishes the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Instead, in the mountains we have to be careful not to sepulte you an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> According to that, every one of the races is well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There are only a couple of models, but this is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a moment, intentáis beat a number of rival demanded - than normal in a classic race - after tratáis to win time - classic duel cronometrado - and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In all of this is sometimes the police, that does nothing but make things more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The first are the landscape outside the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> There are interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, you must escape from someone and need to help him, always pressing the button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, which has significantly less landscapes in the game than might be expected, there are only three in particular. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be upset and, in the context as mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of driving follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That means that as of today it is not much, but you can not claim to be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If buscáis a realistic simulation, because you can look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But in a race designed with quite action suits him quite this style of driving, although we could find something better between the games in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, so good. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems arise after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the right of driving patterns, as does not happen with collisions. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of games of this kind can not be expected that recreated with deformities and collisions complicated, but in fact before a coup against any object, you can not predict how will your car, so not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Bringing it is typical that, in making a meeting forward looks very tight or move the car with a normal traffic light, only has almost identical friction, but in other situations, your car just doing dodges uncontrolled. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even just totally destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the reseteo system, no major problems arise, but can poneros from bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The reseteos planned so that when you suffer an accident or you salt of the runway, the game you rescue redraws the last item on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In every race, however, only five are available reseteos available. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If the consumís all, you must restart the race from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very trustworthy. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, even the reseteo aid, only the learned the stage aid given to memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> A huge disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> In some curves, for example, Must be entering a specific mode; otherwise, they are impossible to take. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Other times you encontráis somewhere &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles with the same configuration, although you are always the first, fifths or lleguéis five minutes before or after. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This makes rabiar especially in situations, when veis that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent forward without problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Is like when lleguéis, because is scheduled for the &quot;surprise&quot; always happen under your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents also have one more advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game llegaréis to sites where, without taking into account the time, you always adelantará the same opponent in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Besides this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Your opponent must come before you, the price that is. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it goes in front of you, you makes the vision of the cars that come from front, so you can make the car porridge at first. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you probably disappointed immediately. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and often with action, so that it is not possible to continue to detail what happens or where. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And really well, if the credit is the idea with 50 clues exclusive or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the change during the racing cars. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must be aware of the petrol pumps at the side of the road, precisely because there must change their car, but in the vast majority of cases you what you will suffice. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports are suited to urban areas, the strong American cars for motorways and the exotic superdeportivos prescription for a driving technique, for example, by mountain roads with curves. </seg>
<seg id="244"> But primary narrative thread is also a thread of challenges parallel, that is, there are specific races in places that conoceréis by stories. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here conseguiréis medals, but also points to experience not only for your profile, which serves both to the challenges and fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="246"> By reaching the upper level, the driver was opened several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds to the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> At the same time, there is a role autolog connected online, which compare your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other community functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the most difficult elements to understand is how is that the last race in history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> With the car you have arrived to the underground tunnel - pass - where you ponéis to run in the dark for the tracks - pass. </seg>
<seg id="250"> The speedometers OS marks between 150 and 200 km / H - happens - and, suddenly, after you get The convoy of metro and brings you ahead without further. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In drafting we may have a discussion on this for several days, whether during the game&apos;s programming any thought even a little or if the authors we really taken by a bunch of bobos. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side of the game is not unusual, but at least the general visual effects are pleasant in the majority of cases, sometimes even soberbios. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments it reduces the picture quality and, at times, in a serious way. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This applies especially to accidents where involved many participants, continued when the picture quality is no longer valid. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio noise is good and the gang is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to make it through most of the youth group, the band&apos;s liking noise belongs to the category &quot;each of his father and his mother,&quot; but you can assume that nobody would buy the game only for his music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The final sense of Need for Speed: the run is therefore quite confusing. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we have problems in stating that the run is the best game of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Get the feeling that the game is not over. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The fun is guaranteed, but preparaos as mistakes you will strike in the eyes with the force of a spotlight of airport. </seg>

<seg id="276"> The ambassador to the EU, vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptics. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&apos; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I was not expecting to be montase a senseless war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;will last five, six years, before the situation stabilises a little, a calming and the new players accustomed to their new roles,&quot; began its conference with conviction in the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How does not take seriously its slogan &quot;clearly and openly about Europe,&quot; said already in the first part of his conference, when it managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers at the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also ponderó the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;First arise, that if criticism is bland, A grey, capable of assuming any official role, but I have to say that left bemused, because it all for their roles in perfectly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a man that you can listen to the members of the 27 States, communicate with them and that has a clear vision of where the EU must go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new post of representative of the foreign and security policy is out of the question: &quot;Who is this EU? what number I call it?.&quot; So this is an important step towards unification and clarification of the Union&apos;s policy for states such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> People no one wants to prevent us from the Olomouc cheese </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová has also addressed the agenda was, is and will the European Council in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs emerging dealt with the economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and hosted a summit for the Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which has severely in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the ambassador: &quot;A good waves,&quot; not only the Presidency but also the financial crisis, that is being addressed now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> On the other hand, the EU has to approve the budget for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the budget is more simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Ambassador also recalled its main slogans, with those who came to Europe: &quot;clearly about Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;The truth is that I do not like the abreviaciones rough, the extranjerismos or the jargon that people do n&apos;t understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;How can a citizen really understand that in Brussels are not invented round cucumbers curvos or cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="298"> Also aims to make more use of the EU&apos;s environment and bring more Czechs to European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> We expect the Europe of the speeds </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people felt more positive that the negative aspects. </seg>
<seg id="301"> In addition, regretted the low turnout of the Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of encouragement, but also the little support from the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="303"> After the success of the Czech Presidency, stressed the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman at my side tells me:&quot; What, already have been, the Visegrad Group&apos;s?, &quot;and you see that it does no grace.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, the EU, according to vicenová, would await new regulations hard budgetary policy for the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Is perceived as a very real concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new &quot;The European Federation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the euro zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;It said for the first time only cooperating countries who WANT AND THAT, not outside it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;These procedures will be increasingly and strengthen the Europe of the two speeds,&quot; is expected vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect, Czech and of Herman Van Rompuy also underlined the role in the application of the principle, whereby all the issues that affect the whole of the EU must be discussed between the Member States, not only among the members of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brandt story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone had a term sought to investigate with great precision IBM&apos;s strategy, the closer would be &quot;long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and 100 years since its founding, however, have already passed. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this nature largoplacista became the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr </seg>
<seg id="317"> As he coined the slogan that many world&apos;s problems can be solved if people are prepared to believe. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its motto &quot;Think!&quot; became its label, around which will build the life of future domestic - was also the title of a magazine that giant IBM began to publish in 1935. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was also the basis of a culture of enterprise carefully lifted. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us, IBM involves a continuous thinking long term, a movement in the direction of the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and flourished for 100 years for that reason, because he stuck to its basic principles, but without fear around the changes. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That has allowed us, for our first century, transform the technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We expect thrive even more in our second century, &quot;said during its anniversary, the company&apos;s current Director Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, already in the 1930s, was keen for the care of their employees as the employer of Baťa Czech Republic - IBM employees were among the first American employees who enjoyed paid leave, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that premiaba the best inventors and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The same sophistication maintains IBM in the relationship with the customer in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Right from the beginning the company knew discover talents - as one of the first global companies into ending discrimination of any kind, could choose without problems. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with IBM&apos;s antidiscrimination strategy is the current plan, for which a woman will replace next year to Palmisano: Virginia rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It already has worked 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> In recent years, IBM has participated from the &apos;virtual meetings, ideas in line, in the rain that arise reams of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that sobren ideas, because almost half a million people work in the signature. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM company held a concept of institution rather than technology,&quot; says the economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of books on IBM rosabeth moss kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology,&quot; makes George colony Fair of the consultancy Forrester research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Great Green&quot; - as it is known in the US familiarmente because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the world&apos;s largest companies. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is perhaps the most versatile technology company - develops both hardware and software, infrastructure and housing Web Services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holds the largest number of patents for all the American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among their inventions are the ATM, payment cards, the swaps, bar codes and the disquetes. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM facturará 220 billion dollars this year and this year has become the second technology firm by market capitalization - the first is APPLE - when it first passed in 1996 to Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking to the future </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of customers and the time - IBM not argued for its own operating system, OS / 2, IBM pcjr online services prodigy or computers. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If your business is based on progress, but not emotionally can anchor in the past,&quot; Samuel J. Palmisano recognised. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms - and equally, if they are not, the leaves. </seg>
<seg id="346"> And that the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically is maintained and falls exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Future technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> In terms of sales, IBM is devoted mainly to services, of which around a fifth are of programmes and a fifth of equipment. </seg>
<seg id="349"> In all, even in 1990 the equipment accounted for more than half of the share of providers. </seg>
<seg id="350"> As of the year 2000, IBM has sold poorly performing assets with a total value of $15 billion, during the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology in future. </seg>
<seg id="351"> The investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time was the modern global financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Find the company IBM has so far managed to weather the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the shares of IBM since the start of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase. </seg>
<seg id="355"> IBM&apos;s currency is change everything, except their value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You can, therefore, expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible aguantará. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: from the cortadora cheeses to the space flight </seg>
<seg id="358"> The company IBM - International Business Machines - was founded 100 years ago in New York, with its original name computing tabulating recording Corporation. </seg>

<seg id="368"> Watson was so crucial to the company, nearly 40 years After occupying the Chair&apos;s boss, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM began work in the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s, the staff and the IBM computers helped NASA to lead the flights to space - Mercury, Saturn and the famous flight to the moon in 1969. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, IBM developed the first generation of computers in 1964, the IBM system / 360 series. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classics &quot;pecés&quot; standard, which was installed on computers at the time, came to market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the company from consultancy Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and high value added services. </seg>

<seg id="405"> If pedís to men who are able to cite some typical vices of women in general each appoint without thinking. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dear women, do you reconocéis in the following lines, where female are certain vices that can make boiling blood to men? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Go shopping </seg>
<seg id="408"> Do you blame its orange dependence on the average shopping? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Does it have to buy at least a week trapito? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Would you like to buy often in sales? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then if you can say that shopping has become a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are realising that should appease his passion for purchases, at least a little. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But to see what women could resist the temptation of carrying without further by the clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and then probárselas - ideally in all different colours - all in the probador? </seg>
<seg id="414"> But for most women go shopping is a pastime, so the men can almost become a hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Just remember how many times has already told his partner to better the wait in front of the door. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too fat?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;would need to lose weight at least five kilos - should start doing exercise?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;Do you really happy?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Do you read those words? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Why yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then it is one of those women obsessed by their looks. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Is that you should not fail to care, but many men are allergic to listen to their partner complain all the time about their physical aspect. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The strong sex also agrees that the more increases the frequency of complaints, more annoying are women. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The order and cleanliness first </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is like a merry-go-round indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Cleaning the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, washing-up soil, remove the dust, washing-up the bath and all that at least twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Do you blame your partner that it has applied the clean soil with a dirty feet, their children who have daubed a hand basin newly cleaned and a shelf with glass doors that both cost clean? </seg>
<seg id="429"> If you suffer this &quot;diversion,&quot; proves to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleaning should not be surely be paramount in the family. </seg>

<seg id="432"> &quot;The calzoncillos used are left with the dirty clothes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You get so tomorrow these socks used&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;The attack letter not left the ground!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If these comments his partner more times a day ago, know that it will move their boxes. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Naturally, you do n&apos;t want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps, if the men knew this, women, for its part, would not make such comments. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Smears and gossip </seg>
<seg id="439"> For some women they are also the smears, the gossip, but also the offences and conspiracy against someone. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are concentrated in relationships, so I like to talk about things like who, where, together with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Maybe sometimes to each one of us is aware of a small, harmless chisme. </seg>
<seg id="442"> With hand on heart, that it is in almost all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> On the other hand, there are chismosas of these women are not controlled, whom I love chismorrear and do so often, despise all and are dangerous to those around the female labour, especially on a team. </seg>

<seg id="448"> After the meeting, Jágr overseas said to journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Before the party had already said it would triplete.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I was very much aware of the fact.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes appear ambushes,&quot; Jágr explained, after his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, following the first trallazo flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A short while after the team&apos;s second speech was also a trail Czech. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček was done with the hurricanes disk behind the net and it led between the circles to maxim Talbot, put that goal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was thrown out, but since the beginning of the second half we dominated the flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> On Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase Wayne Simmonds for the quarter of the net. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love playing with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;Not to say that this is the best player on the field, but certainly is among the top three,&quot; ponderó Jágr at its core. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I would have never occurred at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman as him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am very happy about this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> All these years in the NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and that Jágr now produces results, &quot;added. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with the goal of tuom ruutu penalty, and then again Dwyer, to get to a goal away. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt read did not allow more complications, although they were beaten on number of two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;pronger had a good performance in our field.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;despejó disc, I took speed and it was read to the most remote part.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to atinarle disk and I am happy that we got,&quot; voráček described the last goal of the match as lived. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the forefront of this conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, not played until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second quarter fell by an injury in the upper part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Canadiens not only lost a player with wide experience in defence, but also by a margin of two goals, 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomáš plekanec failed to take one of the shootings. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the points lost to local trainer mourned the large number of injured in the back row, and play the game with just five defenses. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;This is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We play the only party with a veteran player, the rest were inexperienced.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;In the end, but it is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Both rotated players turned on us, it could not resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Had to further simplify the game, make the disk of our countryside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;And so we leave gaps,&quot; explained one of the defences, P. K. subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The goalkeeper Ondřej pavelec contributed with 30 Winnipeg&apos;s interventions in 5:2&apos;s victory over Tampa Bay. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The goals of Jets were marked by five players who put end to a series of defeats already lasting five parties. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How travel prices have evolved since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 was in the then Czechoslovakia just five state licensed travel agencies: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agents at the time were selling IN MOST CASES travel only the Socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR - German Democratic Republic - to the Soviet Union, I Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary - both in the Black Sea - Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when we could travel to Yugoslavia, However, after the Yugoslavian Government went to the West and the travel of Czech tourists were then quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the Socialist bloc - and also to the checoeslovacos - they are not allowed to travel freely and individually or even for the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen wanted travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not individual, the trip was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies offered at those times also travel to the West, but one was put in the queue with a sack of sleep and move known as well all night, or &quot;good&quot; in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Yet all was not won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The &apos;promise of change &quot;that was the condition for travel to the West, not be attached to the&quot; politically unreliable people, &quot;that they could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was a freely convertible currency, and no guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources - the Western currency - to travel to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The vast majority of the Czechs switch their holidays in their own country, so we had a large number of huts and houses of summer, that the Czechs grew. this habit remains robust. </seg>
<seg id="493"> How to travel from the Czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 for us was the most spend the holidays will not in the GDR or Bulgaria, the last year the Czechs were 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Is NNA great paradox, which today are no longer aware, the fact that the favourite destination currently, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because part of the then Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In the early 1990s was the abolition of visas to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short duration of visits, especially to Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, long, were tired of excursions to the West, not everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, their sleep groups of Czechs in Paris in parks in tents, as our then not allowed us to pay a hotel or pension income. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the take away with food - canning, sausages, etc. - to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of The Czech koruna, our western tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and with him also increased the average pay around 1997, which led to an increase in demand for travel. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increase in demand for travel agencies, began to regularly from 1997, to prepare the travel using the connections of charter flights, which made incredibly travel prices down in comparison to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s of the last century, the Czechs were already without visas to almost all developed countries, except us, which simplificó our travel further. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario happened in 2000, when he was already organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since that year, leave all the years direct charter flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and hot. this winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> The exotic countries currently visiting Czech close to $100 a year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this time, which symbolises our development pos-revolucionario arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, US removed the visas for Czech tourists, with what our country has become among the most developed countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, for the first time in its history, the Czechs have spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in its history, have been spent on Czech travel abroad more than 15 thousand kroner per head, including the costs stay on the site. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Called ordinary General Assembly to elect a president, which could end up again at a standstill. </seg>
<seg id="511"> For nearly five months, the Czech football is no president and it is likely that the Czech Ivan Hašek once&apos;s successor as president of the Federation of football - fačr - not known or after the announcement of the next extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> In fact, no agreement has been reached on voting rules to follow. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Even without them, they will not vote to choose between the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Those interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomáš paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek once resigned his post in June but not before calling his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person who knew care of football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> However, after the end of Hašek once, it sparked a controversy was unable to reach a partnership between the two federations common agreement to choose a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> It became apparent on 16 September when had to be elected the new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the National General Assembly met in vain in the home - Národní dům - located in the district praguense Smíchov, and not just because the talks had been blocked on the method of choice. </seg>
<seg id="519"> No consensus was reached or in terms of who in the General Assembly had a right to vote - just the legal representatives or the delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that moment on and due to this one point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, under which the representation for full powers is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Disputes over the electoral code, however, remain open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Most no longer could shed light on the situation or the Executive Committee that, in their meetings, normal or abnormal, basically resolved nothing. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The view on the possibility of voting has already changed a couple of times, but the nerve point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute hinges on whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the fačr, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who has highest percentage of support in the Federation which will present its candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Moravia region is willing to compromise to win the candidate with a greater percentage of total votes in both federations. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations points, should have the majority of at least two thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;It would remove, however, the sense of the two previous rounds and negate the entire concept of bicameral system,&quot; This is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With this agreement, surprisingly, is also tomaš paclík, even though it means that the electoral regulations set by the statutes of all the candidates would be better off pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I would like to be voted the most agree with the statutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;Not to invent any nonsense about the representatives and in the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of victory Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and mainly directed his remarks against pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new President and he believes that the candidates in future cooperate constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions are apaciguarán with today&apos;s Party of our national team at the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will be leading, and cooperate more at ease&quot; The representative of the jablonice says, that the three candidates has more experience in management of football, both professional and regional levels. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the most reticent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope that an agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It is not the conflict between bohemios and moravos, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;In any case, I hope that common sense will prevail,&quot; he said rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is no longer much time for all parties to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations were carried out in Montenegro, but who can know until it begins the party if the football team be complete? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The Special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, has not gone this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to part of the Executive Board classification to the place where the match will take place. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Quizas the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which allegedly, will take place this Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to get the parties split on the country&apos;s most powerful sporting organisation for an agreement to be reached. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Much is at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the central committee of the Czechoslovak federation of sport - čstv - to try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the House of SAZKA lotteries. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík will strive to reach the Presidency, because there is a more suitable candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the Pilsen footballers, tomaš paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a candidate who satisficiese all his views on the new president of the Czech Football Federation - fačr - or will be filed as a candidate for a post as relevant. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there were a person, I would be fighting for it and not present as a candidate in the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But to this day has not been able to find such a person,&quot; said paclík for the Czech News Agency - ČTK - </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav pelta and Henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking pelta, the presumed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation - fačr. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also makes that fair, where defeat, would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when will the turn of the ordinary General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In office he would like to see an expert and good football manager who is not too closely related to the events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have already spoken to some people that could take into account.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me It was crazy to hear some say that not even want to identify with the Czech football at this time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would change that vision,&quot; it adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> It supposedly more embarrassing to paclík at this moment is pelta&apos;s relationship with the President of the Football Association&apos;s regional Pilsen Roman berbr, a man with a controversial past, outside the mundillo known as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For paclík is as unacceptable to see pelta sitting in the chair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If they win, we maintain the status quo and nothing in football will change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;With the support of berbra, still less an ambitious businessman, football will benefit,&quot; said paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Also mentions the fact that a few years ago pelta&apos;s name was associated with a telephone listens during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which pelta went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do n&apos;t know what pelta prestige football could bring victory.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And with what eyes we will look UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said paclík, which also takes some caution with his earlier statement that &quot;it would sell the club Pilsen if pelta become president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case of winning elections on Thursday, paclík could consider cooperation with pelta in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Of same view is the other candidate, rajchl, which was supported by paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;he - pelta - would be the first to Continue.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;is very capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But not as manager of a partnership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose where I am not capable,&quot; he added paclík, which in September raised much attention for supporting the suspension of the committee chaired by ludek referees after macel, replaced by Dagmar damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that would manage the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Uses its management capabilities of private companies, because since last summer, is also the Director of the Pilsen, with your support held in May the triumph at first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have strength to change some things in the field of football and help secure its practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;to reduce the influence of Some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, some unpleasant situations, said paclík without concealing their section to the President of Sparta Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between the fačr and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the assistance of which exerted pressure on political leaders to make more money in the sport of taxes in the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;is one of the key problems that there should be the new president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If increased taxes on gambling, as it announced the political parties, would support their arguments, but, frankly, they need to tell us where all this money is being spent,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="579"> In addition, paclík now does not even take into account its association with the club Pilsner, although he says that the President of the fačr must be &quot;no supporter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and rajchl with Dukla of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It&apos;s not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I see no meaning to the fact yield hypocritically my actions of Pilsen club to another person and then go back after a year and a half,&quot; said paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> The fačr pelta promised new statutes that should end the impasse on the elections. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav pelt promised that, if elected, would ensure that the fačr had new statutes that definitely serve to solve, disputes over the electoral rules in the future. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the conflict leading up to the elections could move towards a solution today with the possible victory for the football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Already before the elections conducted in September, pelta promised not focus, if elected, in precisely the representation and raise funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Decided to take part in the last minute at the last General Assembly, so this postponement of two months I could go well to defend and, in a broader context, present their ideas on the management of football. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People of all levels are running the football for a long time now and waiting to hear this Thursday on new president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership,&quot; the man who thinks jablonice is mainly associated with the club, but who worked in the Sparta and on the executive committee of the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that existed in the time of Ivan Hašek once. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, in June the General Assembly approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,&quot; pelta warned. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly readjustment of the most important document of the civic association was used as a lure to win over the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond In case this fail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a matter of principle, without which we can not exist,&quot; says pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Moreover, in theory, is not meddle with its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Had warned in the past that was already working with Henry rajchl, which respected for their training in law, being aware of his opponent would also be his first vice president. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Already has long without attacking Thomas paclík who, contrary to pelta, left no puppet with head. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;takes more than a year in the world of football, and has already had some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;So many of them doubt about its true nature,&quot; he said to his opponent pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its most powerful weapon is, he says, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the superior. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The latter should be promotional showcase of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;It would solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately after I involucraría in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole game,&quot; he said two months ago to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then also promised that his appointment as President of football does not imply any personal modification of the workforce. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;should know the tasks of every employee,&quot; he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, is an understandable nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that we anticipate to achieve the next General Assembly, he does not think that the delegates will travel in vain Nymburk this Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, No doubt we will overcome. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility, which will only if finally has a leader,&quot; two days before the day even more decisive in his career, pelta representative remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the fačr would start to work with renewed vigour. </seg>
<seg id="613"> If IN THE FOURTH General Assembly elected the current deputy Jindrich rajchl as new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would be surely embittered. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Board responsible for each area of football individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also remains committed to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money for football and continue the work begun by the former president Ivan Hašek once. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As president, I would like to turn on football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, through the professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;I do not mean that they would all alone,&quot; rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member can devote themselves to a specified area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And asignaré difficult tasks for that football can, in each of these segments, continue with much momentum.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;to many people that probably would not appreciate this, because will start to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, is said to have considered the possibility of not stand again as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;Everyone knows, that work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I do n&apos;t know that it makes sense and that there will be people behind me that I will and hamper at every step,&quot; explained the reasons for his indecision. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people told me that I must not give up, because then they would up others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;is about having faith not to leave as well, nothing more,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They say, motivates him also continue the work that began with Hašek once already. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;During those two years, is over a lot of the work that I do not want to now be lost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that had been started and that will have its effect in a couple of years and I would like someone to stop,&quot; announced not worried about the fact that if we got the other candidate, Miroslav pelta, the situation in the partnership could be as it was before the age of Hašek once. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek pelta is not able to maintain. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Behind him is &quot;especially all those people that he would look into the football just to make it a privilege for a select few.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;You can accuse me a lot of things, but the fact that I am not in favour of someone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to make a football for everyone, because only then will feel well everyone and not just the elected,&quot; said rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Also rejects the idea that only Bohemian serious resort President. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do as much for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to come to divide the second division in a Czech Republic and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;would not be the current situation where we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for moravos young players,&quot; said rajchl. </seg>

<seg id="650"> Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous spas in Budapest: blue who visits Europe can live their dream, and, after a visit to the city or a caminata, rest their legs tired in burbujeantes baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where is the best welfare in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris meder made a journey of research over the past year and a half, there was something that could not fail in their luggage, a bañador. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Tumbada back on the water, looked the artistic head on top, marble, towards the angelotes, I swam, that the standing on the edge of the swimming pool and asombraba before the swimming pool deck modernist restored searched. </seg>
<seg id="654"> He liked the bathing, noted in his libreta interesting at the moment of all the details on the style and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The architectural historian meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and the presents in his recent book &quot;badefreuden&quot;: the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of bathing in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete buildings&quot; in Taunus. </seg>

<seg id="657"> This German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of swimming. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Wants nothing to do with the sport, says meder, only the water is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Only annoys him that fans have to settle for azulejos blue bathing and reeks of chlorine, while the fans to run can breathe the forests of abetos fascinating smell or hear the cheerful trinos of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day I wondered why the swimming pools they always have to be so ugly,&quot; says this inhabitant of Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started collecting fine swimming pools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of the water is double the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the unreal oils of the sauna. the factor of prosperity in the swimming pools is so great because all the senses are addressed, according to meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builder is trying, the indoor swimming pools can be a real gift to see: &quot;instead of soil, it has an area of water in the bath.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;On the one hand is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All bends ópticamente: the high bóvedas, the colors, the azulejos springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The book with pictures in small format &quot;badefreuden provides in 190 pages&quot; Very interesting data on the architecture and art history in the historical oasis of welfare, but, mostly, one might be tempted to jump to blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Meder, swimming pools coleccionista discovers the exemplary highlighted in its investigations in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths as the bloodbath Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique cavidad kárstica - Spas in cavidades miskolc-tapolca - as well as a termas, whose swimming pools are alkali-manganese waters and are in a building with a bottle - városi termálfürdö in jászberény. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: while the whole city puts the eyes in the swimming pool techada of Zurich, you can look at arlberb, covered in snow, from the swimming pool outside of a bath in St. antón, and: the Turkish bath has a window from which you can observe the practice in the lines of ski. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The most extraordinary design, perhaps, waiting for customers in längenfeld water: the Cathedral of ötztal seems a ovni just land in the Alps. </seg>

<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> To meder, swimming pools, it&apos;s coleccionista was invading the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many spas Hot Springs smell of sulphur, in Árpád bathing in békescsaba, Hungary, the plague diesel is so strong that people think having reached a health check. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and álcali and whose légamo snag to the skin to walk into the swimming pool, a welfare enjoyment in a special way. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Iris meder was also disappointed in a place in their pursuit of fine places for bathing, visit when he discovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech luhatschowitz bath, was found with a ground blocked. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bloodbath 1902 the architect Duan jurkovic was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When meder looked through the desmoronadas windows of the building modernist red, white and yellow, saw the undergrowth grow between the azulejos. </seg>
<seg id="680"> The decline contrarrestaba in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the palace spa in ADB wildbald. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These SPAs have three phases of construction behind it; not only is may find neorománicos elements in times of its construction in 1844, if not also added a style Alhambra Arab Hall, in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since their careful modernisation in 1995, the palace spa bath is the favorite of the coleccionista of swimming pools, Iris meder natural, and not just because he is in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;All credit to merge different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic,&quot; says meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> Immersion in the swimming pool at such a palace spa apparently has no importance. </seg>

<seg id="722"> The flag moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Ingeborg wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the Austrian Expo pavilion of 1958 Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna to a museum, was empty and collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now reopened as house of exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The postgerra modern architecture, the forms clear, passionate about the halls ball, the bold curves and the new construction materials, typical of thoughts on the technical progress, for which, the Austrian flag of the architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Expo is a suitable example and known. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The flag of schwanzer floating architecture for its light and then won the Grand Prix construction of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building is deemed to present a landmark contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Did the architect so well known that also built the flag of Austria in the next World exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary four cylinders to mbw more the Tower Building adjacent aplanado in Munich, became internationally known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its flag, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions arose after the Expo in schweizer garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and was unveiled in a museum of the 20th century, was called the &quot;home 20.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was adequate but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="733"> In spite of this was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building is empty since 2001 and increasingly lapses. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Currently, the architect Adolf krischanitz reformed the flag, now called it &quot;house 21&quot; and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday evening, the museum was opened Belvedere, she belongs to the home, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes husslein-arco, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere since 2007, reached a new beginning. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-arco, a doctor in Art History with a considerable artistic career, among other things, patinadora on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art Museum in Salzburg, conducted with the insistence of political reforms and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> With the exception of contemporary art, are the works of the Foundation&apos;s Fritz wotruba sculptor homónima, there should be a bar and a bookstore and built an office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict budget under control </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the best choice to do so. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because reformed so sensitive the secession of Joseph olbrichs in Vienna, expanded and was granted the Competition, if not because studied with schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was a &quot;huge and important place for him,&quot; in which contained statements &quot;Almost every weekend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="743"> Knew the project and the problem of building, who disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in their generosity and easily change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reforms have major problems, the building was &quot;a devorador of energy,&quot; said krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> You changed the profile of the glass windows of the facade, it installed a glass insulating reinforced with glass fiber and remplazó the glass ceiling by a special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The thermal bridges and the steel beams were strengthened or remplazaron and the ceilings of asbestos are rehabilitaron. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements were for the new use, a panel of light declined between the house and the street provides lighting, a new bridge serves to enter the building almost, but still the schwanzer pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Remain outside the gates, the original home is painted in shades old species of true mahogany and protected against the oxidation. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> All this with a strict control of the Office of monuments and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;often had to find material that is good, cheap and also like monuments to the office of protection,&quot; says krischanitz and warns of a rough in the basement floor. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The flag that came from Brussels &quot;has been difficult,&quot; said recently krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> An architecture that is &quot;always in the wrong place and therefore wanted to&quot; raise awareness &quot;appropriate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, Urban has happened a stroke of luck, the completely new and planned &quot;District of Central station,&quot; with homes and offices, is beside the schweizer garten. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: the Home krischanitz 21 could receive a strengthening of another building, as the coleccionista Francesca von Habsburg Berlin has bought the temporary art room and, as we hear, negotiates with the city on a neighbor in the schweizer place garten. </seg>

<seg id="852"> Is clear how it calculates the value of a person according to the amount of their taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current information of the Turkish media returns to show how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country. </seg>

<seg id="855"> The bank of the lake Zurich scandal </seg>
<seg id="856"> Europe is not the most risky bank in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it slid from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it is run by a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Sure that Axel Weber had thought not. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the summit of the Federal Bank in July was that by 2013, would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: president of the Administrative Council of big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber is glad publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and makes nice comments about their future fellow drop. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The USB has achieved a revitalization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I am pleased to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September, it became clear that everything would be entirely different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A financial operator of the London USB avoided all the bank&apos;s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald grübel, Director General of the USB, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The Chairman of the Administrative Board of the USB was equally touched, and Since then all Axel Weber is asked: when? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Was that Weber will advise the Bank since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Administrative and will take over the Presidency of the Council in may, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard to Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Is not a banker, rather, economics professor and adviser and has had an adaptation period probably necessary. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Once, is responsible for the strategy of a bank, who has just returned to prove that deserves the title &quot;the scandal of Europe&apos;s largest bank&quot; for some time. </seg>
<seg id="873"> On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the world&apos;s largest administrator of goods, and on the other hand, for years, slipped from one scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, will save the once so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> The financial crisis began. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Administrator of Swiss goods discreet and sound, but also mañoso, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in the investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, advanced as Investment Bank in the League of the world&apos;s big banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This impressive. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the former banker and later Professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: &quot;To my students, I always referred to the USB as a model of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;from today&apos;s perspective, one question: how could be wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> Was a big mistake. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, Peter wuffli, Director General, which until then was considered a brilliant banker and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later, the reason came under suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Bank&apos;s investment fund embarked on hedge losses with titles and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To have that, the USB announced an injection of capital from no less than 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this naturally found investors, that some watched with disdain until shortly before: an Asian State Fund and opaque so discreet of Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which had never been heard his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel ospel greatly, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, continued the wrong, in view of their investments, the UBS disaster was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought distressed securities to the UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond through the Bank&apos;s him as copropietaria. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Every Switzerland was hit, said the tragic that this was for a small country, if aloja such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland - see graphic. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We can not return to rescue the UBS,&quot; said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="898"> To the first joined the Second disaster. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed he was ready to deliver the data of wealthy clients, which may have disappointed taxes with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Moreover, adopted a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits from this business with compensation for payment. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With this, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Simultaneously lost something that was always his capital in the competition for customers rich: the halo of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> To that followed the resignation of the President of the Board and the President of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customers&apos; funds. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in the wrong by speculation and investment banking in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when returning to be more calm, just when it was thought that the UBS returning to achieve this, happens this unfortunate history of operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank should know that something was going wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it was unveiled, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;with the case adoboli is that too little risk controls have changed,&quot; says Martin banking Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German bank is also certain is that: &quot;The problem of the UBS did not control risk controls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> So arose the idea of the caution, with which the Swiss Bankers are presented for some time, be the guardians of the world&apos;s biggest goods: no risk too big, however, the safety of money to fail on the other side of the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Security deposits of iron Swiss banks were the symbol of the reliability, as Lindh and sprüngli of real chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The heart of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, is only a little more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in the street bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the Swiss summits covered in snow in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here are ostentosos buildings, the rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Here are joyerías as tiffany&apos;s between traditional business Swiss and the confectionery sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Here lie for years Swiss banks: from the National Bank, through the palace of Crédit nothing, until the elitarios private banks as Julius bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It falls in the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are revestidas of marble, before there are large leather belonging, together with the bank&apos;s logo is a great sign to indicate the &quot;security.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer is: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Crédit nothing, at some point have dismissed the idea of big Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as is the president of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Prefers not to read her name in the newspaper, after all, as does all the Swiss Bankers, also with the business of both big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become too big, believes, primarily in investment banking, where the Englanders have gained ground. </seg>
<seg id="925"> There the Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And have become accustomed to the customs of the long Englanders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, the UBS changed the investment banking members, delivered its first big gain and then came the European financial disaster, nothing had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as The great Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday the coalition government of The tiny country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas hässig in his book &quot;Der ubs-crash&quot; - &quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Politicians gave to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the great bank of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How do you do? </seg>
<seg id="932"> TALKS WITH THE Swiss Bankers, see the problem in the dimension of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks are merged into a powerful consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank that arises, due to the merger, was too big for the little Switzerland, and continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> So he served so that the two different banks harbingers of the UBS is they were additional: a rich but sleeping with the Central Bank of the administration of goods in Zurich and a stronger internationalisation poorer but. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, investment banks internacionalizados arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could do with running a large financial bicycle. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two names associated with this rise of the UBS: peter wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel ospel greatly, then President of the Administrative Council. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that wuffli and ospel were a perfect team,&quot; says the expert in banking, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that meant a lot of models and statistics, and ospel intuitive that secured their way from the learning in the bank until the summit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, ospel fió wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And at the end wuffli committed a fatal flaw: &quot;Probably thought that their models were a reality,&quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;It is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: the mistake came before the event. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The employees of the UBS is clearly remember the meetings of managers, in which wuffli, the head of the consortium, echoed the same slogan: always leaving the Throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American Bank was the world&apos;s most powerful Investment Bank. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Encabezaban &apos;league tables&apos;, the rankings which then documentaban the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The UBS wanted to be at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps you went well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the operations of foreign currency and in the trading of shares was higher. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Advisers companies charged, however, showed a weak point: in the business of international interest, in the language of Banking &quot;fixed income &apos;, there is a huge compensation for the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill the gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Greedy for growth, invested both the same Bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investment at risk. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Was transformed into a powerful machine for American titularizar mortgage loans and then sell them, maintaining certain risks on their own account. </seg>
<seg id="956"> And also, as other banks sought the long decline. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;in the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great the euphoria, so deep the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The positions in the UBS became seats are unsafe and proyectables until today. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Currently, who heads a large bank, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for a bank, to which all the logical business models are lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to banking investments, focus on the administration of Swiss goods, return to the roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The Bank does not go that far - yet. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking must drop much, it is clear now. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The next Thursday, Sergio ermotti, the bank&apos;s new president, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In reality, only emerged in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a temporary solution, as the Bank is surprisingly of his predecessor grübel separated. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, he was permanently: should conduct the business of the UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to give back the investment bank to its rule in the mid 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Deletes 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But that is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What does make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that sure is currently Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="976"> So far only says that first seek a house with his wife in Zurich. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, beauty and the pain of the battle - the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history about the first World War, &quot;begins with a long Dramatis Personae of the kind that can do that one was swamped the soul in the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Here are some tips for action: Starting this page and make it a mildly its brand pages. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Will be very familiar with these people in the novelística narrative of Mr Englund, and this Dramatis Personae serve as their GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, is confused and vulnerable in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Mr Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> What he has written here is an unusual paper, which rightly describes as &quot;a work of Anti-History.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Contains some notable names, major treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is not so much a book about what happened, explains, &quot;a book about how happened.&quot; is about &quot;feelings, feelings, experiences and states of humor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; combines the experiences in times of war of more or Less Ordinary 20 men and women, on both sides of the war, from colegialas and botánicos escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, will become crazy or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives parpadean here as candles votivas embers in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are apagan. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Mr Englund&apos;s book is a standard deviation from the history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the fatal of trench warfare on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; expertly moves through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> To the soldiers in this book I fall over hives; one gets the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse-tse are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is a moving book, almost from the start. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordita. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you quedas or huyes? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Anyway, who next? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost no one understands what is happening, or even why we must fight this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;lack of facts,&quot; Mr Englund notes, &quot;has been filling with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; continues to individuals as Florence farmborough English, a nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf German, a young sailor of the High Seas Fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are achieved in the most part of memoirs, letters and other material published earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moment, lost, Mr Englund&apos;s details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of these are about hardship and manage with what we have. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About telling the story of a German colegiala says: &quot;Substitute substitutes, everywhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;ersatz coffee, aluminium imitation false, rubber, paper vendas buttons of wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Still talking about food sucedánea in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Describes&apos; made from rice cooked meat and fat pressing Carnero, topped off with a false bone made of wood; tobacco fact roots and peladuras of potatoes; shoes with soles of running dry wood. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There is, observes, &quot;837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered substitutes coffee.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories are about the honour and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the ferocity and unambiguous about the war: &quot;sientes which, after all, this is what the men are designed for and not to sit down with belonging to a cigarro and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that this veneer civilisation and means that there is a barbaric behind that pechera almidonada and tachonada.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Instead, a British soldier is aware that probably will die, and that no one will notice or mind. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;Once you resigna at the thought of sacrifice, one would hope that could happen before the public,&quot; writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, is horribly similar &quot;to a condemned being strangled in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new kinds of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,&quot; writes Mr Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiario eloquent and convinced of the young century: the mass murderer of good clothes ideologically with clothing that executes its carnage while is sitting behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unexpected ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a disease venérea prostitutes as a way to evade the service in the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The most grotesque expression of this can be seen trade in pus gonocócico, that the soldiers and embadurnan with that buy their genital hoping to end up in the hospital,&quot; writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those who are truly desperate frotan over their eyes, which often leads to blindness for life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter serious, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to their human task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to &quot;exceptionally uncontrollable forces unleashed: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People start to ask why their leaders are doing to combat them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as the Great War and modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as quiet in the face of Erich Maria remarque, instead of comprehensive histories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon unconventional. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has one of the most devastating final i can remember not in a work of fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> It will reveal. To you </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had come from his book, blown off between your fingers of Dramatis Personae, and this page had burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a previous false step, a planned assault on the minute </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The night of Monday to Tuesday because the park was chosen zuccotti would be more empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret except to a few senior officers, saying initially that others were joining an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underlined how the operation was plagaba challenges for the Police Department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Could not repeat the events of recent weeks, as the espray pepper spray on protesters, breaking the rules of the Department and creating a storm of public sympathy for the &quot;okupas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And so the police operation to clear the protesters zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Agents had prepared themselves seeing were developed occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A greater disaster drill was taking place in Randalls Island, with one eye looking zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Agents called the increased training of disorder - measures to combat terrorism involved mobilise quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was on the evening of Monday, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to enter the park came in the &quot;Last Minute,&quot; said someone familiar with the orders, which mentioned the mission only as &quot;an exercise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few polis I know that they were called to this, I said it was not to go into the park zuccotti,&quot; said the person, who spoke on anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only people who know they were going to get into the park zuccotti were at the highest levels of the Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but desistieron when hundreds of protesters emerged ahead of time After hearing about the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Tuesday&apos;s operation meant to several police units, including Special Forces officers around the municipal district - scores of mobile operators routinely used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who travel daily to work, had been back and forth the park during the day, making the 1 p.m. a good hour to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to do so when was the lowest number of people in the park,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Trucks from the emergency services unit with outbreaks and loudspeakers congregaban at the crossing of pike slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and the pregrabados messages that retumbaban from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Community Affairs Officers went to the park with their blue cortavientos clear, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and went. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No shop was until the 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving time for the protesters to collect their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of agents were seen meeting on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists in the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the police department&apos;s chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many Journalists said they tried to avoid them to see the police action in the park, and had been treated rudely by agents. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that the mobile TV in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> As the police moved to the West through the dense thicket of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and bags of rubbish of paper and plastic crammed in clothes, cleaning equipment in the department have followed, picking up what was left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some demonstrators who were refusing to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet soon after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A core group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some did a barrier, and the police went to arrestarlos methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp candaron between them by the arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people were encadenaron trees, Mr Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The emergency services were called to cut players locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests were made in the Park until more or less the 3:30 a.m., Mr Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests were for &quot;disruption of public order and resistance to authority,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. espósito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the department&apos;s Chief of Detectives, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr Kelly, while he was here, &quot;was not conducting operations,&quot; Mr Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of players expected along the eastern side of Broadway, between liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Rose barricades in the streets Cortlandt, a block north of the park, and on the street pine, a block to the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From those positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond the zuccotti park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At any given moment, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most vocal of the night action took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5 a.m., south of the street pine, a demonstrator jumped on the bonnet of a police car, and in others they saw police taking the air in the wheels of a van. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of contrachapado went flying from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalised. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The Union will require support of workers for the city by layoffs </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The Union that represents hundreds of School Support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools that cater to poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon available to the Union City district, 37, in their effort to repeal the redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred seventy and two assistants of the school, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid the City Lost its work on 7 October, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political vendetta by his refusal to allow, last spring, access on the part of the city to a Health Care Fund in charge of working groups to close its budget gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities have categorically denied that allegation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing in the city last month, the education adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the College&apos;s support staff would be made redundant. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials from the city district 37 said that filed the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education that would be sued. There will be a press conference on Wednesday to announce the official launch of demand, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The demand will include Mr Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers made redundant as plaintiffs, all black women or Latin, like the majority of people who lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the city&apos;s legal department, said that the city had not seen the complaint and therefore could not comment on their specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to demand a draft obtained by the New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that the poor schools lost more assistants, who had already been insufficiently subsidised chronic form. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Adds that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side school or Tribeca, 17 aides lost their jobs in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired on 8 and 9 in the south of the Bronx districts. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Given the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, &quot;This is not a district of wealthy parents can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.D. 36 district&apos;s budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which estimated the extra funding for each registration for poor student in schools. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The Union also argues that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memorandum used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, despite the fact that &quot;surplus&quot; describes more often the act of moving a master of a school&apos;s payroll to a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;sixty and six coordinators of parents were laid off,&quot; says the draft of the complaint, &quot;and not just in surplus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed, Congress prepared to come to an agreement on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Seems that Republicans and Democrats on the Hill are ready to finally agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the participation of the US came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding the Libyans on its successful rebellion and US troops for their &quot;courage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers in both parties quarrelled with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and that never came to be voted on in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That left the US mission in a kind of purgatory - with the Legislative Congress annoyed enough to criticise the use by Obama of the mission, but not angry enough to actually Segar grass under his feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate could be ready for action. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and remarkable resistance to rid themselves&quot; and &quot;pays tribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its partners in the coalition that took part in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary courage and professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Does win the new measure the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or divided legislators as did the bill June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. place - Indiana, the Committee&apos;s top Republican. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The place spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob goodlatte - by Virginia Republican - will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually achieves a vote of the whole House in the House or the Senate in this Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers have not succeeded so far to get their amendments in the House, but not for lack of trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are duplicated - the same bill was proposed in both the House and the Senate - and other with slight variations among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone, and another handful &quot;that will monitor the federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical between themselves, but also give their sponsors - especially Republicans new to this job seeking to refine their currículums - the opportunity to boast that they were the &quot;Authors&quot; of the measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate voted a balanced budget amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution that supports the idea that amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several Members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while the representative José E. Serrano - by New York Democrat - want to take away the limit of two terms for Presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial, as well as a proposal that prohibits the burning flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As enthusiasts who have been members in proposing amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111º Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 changes, and presented 66 in the 110º. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when Members presented more than 150 amendments regularly every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate&apos;s library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But then not had much more success than they are now. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment was added - the 27 - was confirmed in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;hit but not defeated,&quot; giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunfighter fired him to quemarropa at a constituent event in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle giffords - for Arizona Democrat - appeared on national television on Monday night, sang with the melody of Broadway &quot;The sun will come out tomorrow,&quot; and said he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In his appearance on ABC News &quot;20/20,&quot; with Diane Sawyer, giffords struggling to form prayers and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The programme documented their difficult way back for the damage caused by a bullet that shattered the skull and perforó him the left side of his brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, returned to the chamber to cast their votes by surprise triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and injured 13, giffords smiled, Rio and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked how they feel, giffords of 41 years, responded: &quot;pretty well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of &quot;20/20&quot; an hour in length, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, &quot;Gabby: a story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special programme analysed the recovery of giffords since the January 8 shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen in his hospital bed, with a afeitada head and a long scar across his face. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can only keep one or two fingers erguidos, while her husband encouraged. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, is to giffords seated in a wheelchair while the therapists taught him how to do simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A head movement. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A every frown on the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, his first word: &quot;what.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In a few days, giffords gave another word - &quot;tostada,&quot; a request for a change in its breakfast menu. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of giffords: the congressman is singing along with the therapists the songs&apos; girls just wanna have fun &quot;of Cyndi Lauper and&quot; free falling &quot;Tom Petty. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> IN THE INTERVIEW with Sawyer, giffords, which makes two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said she was leyéndole to giffords a newspaper article about the killing of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who were killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunfighter suspect, Jared Lee loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being medicado by force while awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died,&quot; he said giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;tough, tough, tough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife&apos;s recovery, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So, I told him,&quot; &apos;Gabby, has not been defeated, &quot;&apos; Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;only has been hit. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you are going to get out of this, and you recuperarte and you are going to come back stronger than ever. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Make the troops feel more pity that respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a display of Wall Street who raised millions of dollars to the veterans are homeless in New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a balada on the impotence, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, marines to broke into their jobs and aviadores around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd of label got up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women were regarded as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organised the spring fundraising. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military official in the show, also known as the then chairman of the joint chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;The showed as a sort of orphan child,&quot; the official wrote in an email. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organisers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Is that the had. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But was not respect, really. It was shame. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The contradictory impressions sharply illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an American public often distant, at times, adorador. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> It provides a great deal TO THE TROOPS with praise for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price, told members of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public increasingly acts as if give those uniformed punishment. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not suffering at all,&quot; said the Brigadier be B. MacFarland, who comandó troops in Iraq and will soon start to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way that some show is set to support us in the role of Souls disempowered.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem thankless or disagree with the public it serves. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also realise that the IRA that confronted the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result, most of the talks on the pity are carried out in silence and in private between the war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine, retired Colonel mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some are mirarían with a sense of fear that they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic locations. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others will wonder whether there would be a &quot;veteran angry and violent beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work at a high level of government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During her job search, he said, he felt that some entrevistadores subtly had asked him whether it would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service you need to deal with the negative image,&quot; recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military concern arises, in part, of the American indifference towards the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The achievements in the field of battle are rarely elected to the praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and direct sees few benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We, as a nation, we do not value the military heroism in ways that were common in the Second World War,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David barno, who comandó US troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the praise of politicians and the public are focused largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognised by the number of road that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army faces mounting pressure to end the violation </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women have a case against the army for its supposed passivity before the rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organised for the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier was 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy night in which she says she was raped by a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was October 2008, and was heading back to its headquarters in the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when she found a colleague who had a package of 12 cans of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;A sign of alarm sounded,&quot; says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> However, the Texas native left aside his concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, no, it is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> Texas&apos; is, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I had listened to my instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the few minutes to get into the room of Lyman, The man came up to him from behind, tirándola down and violándola, argues. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel anxiously await a court decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that have brought against the exsecretario of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go on trial. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., initially meant to 17 plaintiffs, but demand grew at 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their colleagues, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or administer justice right after the alleged assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that he will by the brass of the army, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a structure from top to bottom,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The High Command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that since February, have been in touch with her nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future demand. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead of hoarding all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the federal prosecutor Neil macbride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy - in essence, that the military can not be demanded by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> In a ruling by the Supreme Court in 1950 called the doctrine feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage to the personnel on active duty. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged damage are part of the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the documents say. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Department declined to comment for this article. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women are still officially barred from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear lines of the front. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the army also modernise, Burke says. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in their struggle, and three others are in progress, in addition to their demands. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At the Yale faculty of law, the legal services clinic for veterans is preparing a case against the four main Military Academies for allegedly promoting an environment misogynous. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;The Personality Disorder&quot; allocated to rape victims in order to provide the service&apos;s High - a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women&apos;s Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a petition in December against the veterans administration, by accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles complaints of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 3.158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the prevention of sexual aggression and response from the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, the attacks are notoriously infra reported, and by the Pentagon&apos;s own estimates, that figure at around 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that took place that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the reported cases in the army was on trial - half that of the civil justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of burke, described its attacks as only the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation to the Military Police less than an hour after it had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, he says, was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 different times in a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She was given a rape kit, and the blood of their assailant - a cut in its brazo- was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people declared as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself shouting from the room.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I put in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember I told my command,&quot; official &quot;that was not his trial; that was my view.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> To Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosticó him a disruption of personality, which did not fit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 was dispensed of service under menos-que-honorables terms, what prevents him from receiving any benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, says John Turley, George Washington law professor in the faculty of law. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he says, &quot;in my opinion, should be able to move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first published. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have been a constant critic of the feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence with responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And he adds: &quot;The odds are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things only change when the good people is ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the audience is not on its way, Burke, lawyer for the plaintiffs, will the queue to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases. </seg>

<seg id="1531"> &quot;or until we muramos, what happens first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: how researchers are studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring breivik was just another type aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, breivik, who admitted to having made a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 people dead, he faced his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While breivik may have acted alone, was far from being only in Cyberspace: had spent most of the time that preceded his attack against their computer, going with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right wing groups in social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, how do you find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - you must only come into Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recently published report on the digital populism by the Centre for European Studies British demos. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The personal information of alijo Facebook is so enciclopédico, says Bartlett, researchers could simply use the tool of advertising to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific precision - the way that sellers have been using for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Bartlett fan found half a million of the right wing groups across Europe and then I led signs, but instead of vincularles to a new band or the product of diet, the announcements invited users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;is an entirely new way of doing an investigation,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online supporters of the right wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However, in a kind of turnaround, &quot;Those who combine their activism in line with the offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the screen of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Let&apos;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of the scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the &quot;likes,&quot; messages on the walls and updates of State. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, &quot;supernova data&quot; on Facebook is fueling a boom of academic research, boosting the number of jobs with the site&apos;s name in the title to almost 800% in the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to study people who could not acercarte with a file on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when intentabas encuestar people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You should go through the party, and they never allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the problems of salud-social. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that the university students who spoke of their exploits of borrachera on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with the drink that students who remained silent on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests that colleagues of the students, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of state with its binge drinking. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You ca n&apos;t tackle a problem unless you can diagnose,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, a co-author of Moreno and Director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children&apos;s Research Institute, told the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook is also constantly &quot;pinchando&quot; to his own people to obtain data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Data from the site&apos;s team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine&apos;s Day, the expectation of turnout at half the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness Index - primarily using the information that is accessible - defenders of liberty digital long ago to argue that the site should make available to other their large amount of data for research. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Facebook users know, however, that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice to play at Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the mine site your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey that not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While the researchers have clearly defined guidelines on how to pick up their online data offline, is a free bar for all. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not think that many of the users have found even in the fact that a researcher might be considering their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn knowledge, a sociologist from the laboratory in London, on a study of 2006 student who made public with the walls of Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they were concerned, was only between them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research subject this being completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information a user&apos;s profile and the messages of the wall are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his years as technology, Selwyn investigator believes that a sujetapapeles and a pen remain the best tools for research that anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute for entry into the real world and talk with real people,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social Research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social is still happening offline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;cold and inhuman: Anders breivik Behring makes his first public appearance in court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, he has described himself as a fighter of the &quot;resistance&quot; during his first public appearance in court in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the knights templarios of Norway,&quot; he said before a room full of 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object to the court as it received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge torkjel nesheim interrupted breivik during that breivik monologue, because it &quot;did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason refused to allow breivik, which brought a speech written in advance, head for the relatives of their victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered the police to keep breivik in custody for 12 weeks more, forbidden from access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all the visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came with the hope of look breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that shape is confined under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought he seemed cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of utoya to the station ​ ​ Norway NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked to journalists and the survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite breivik&apos;s bizarre notion of being part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge found that is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that it acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that some would consuele that appear to be the work of an extremist attacks on 22 July instead of a radical group. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not automatically lowers the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would like a monster, but he appeared to think,&quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;would be much easier if it seems.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons from the loss of Steve Jobs interview, are in a theatre this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who contrasted with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of modern technology as the great inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what the fan of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with jobs recently redescubierta which has been dusted as down ahead of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how he understood this creative minds working on the processes and trade flows of products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but also was a meticulous organizer and a yonki diagrams of Flow - a man who believed that many executives were suffering &quot;a disease which is that a great idea is about 90 per cent of the work... &apos;but&apos; there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob cringely was developing the television series the triumph of the nerds - the triumph of the idiots - on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with jobs for a rare extensive and conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Barely 10 years at that time had passed since jobs had already been forced to leave Apple, and worked hard in its popular new computer company next, awaiting adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview cringely was used in nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Was only after the death of jobs that a complete copy in VHS was discovered in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly reeditado archive material, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas landmark this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known to hate the interviews in depth, jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And very very surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In four different points over the course of the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking clearly, where jobs is weighing their thoughts, seeking clarification. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Also there are moments where the perfectionism of jobs coming to the surface, where it appears anxious due to questions of cringely, empujándole to go faster to the issues and arguments of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the age of pixar, iPods or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic lost in the interview, when jobs assesses what it sees that other companies are right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future of the technology. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read póstumas assessments of jobs&apos;s career, but there is something crude and inspiring in the jobs we see here, the Dreamer eager teetering on the brink of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things can and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not long after explained everything in detail here, was and it did. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of lost seven notable sequences of the interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> About how he learned to carry a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;Over the years in the business, I always wondered:&quot; Why do things? &quot;and the answers that you give so are unchanged: &apos;Oh, this is just the way it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does, nobody thinks about things very deeply in business. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify accounting of apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Embarrassed by the way costs are registered - starting with a &quot;standard&quot; that cost was often as a rule of thumb, and then adjusted with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed a factory automated trading ensured that could determine the costs to detail. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the joke the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs recounts the blue box that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hackear effectively the telephone company and give free long distance calls. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> It has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of jobs here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Describes how he and Wozniak proved through the use of a public telephone box, making a call, and then conectándose from a network of AT &amp; T to another, while delivering a loop with the greatest possible amount of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We surround the things around the world half a dozen times and serious public gritabas through the phone and came back a minute later to public telephone in the next door,&quot; says jobs with a risita. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Us two, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could monitor an incredible thing giant - was a lesson, and I do not believe that Apple had never existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs is describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost leave, knocking the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several Members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two erupted in laughter just before the pope himself was excited to go to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On fall in love with the technology - and the sale by phone with Bill Hewlett: </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12, in the hunting of spare parts to build an accountant in frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and made a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Soon after his telephone conversation from 20 minutes to part time, jobs had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a major influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well we were its employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs then became one of the employees of HP who visited the company&apos;s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first computer table ever done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Was as big as a suitcase of handset catódico, had a small screen, and I enamoré from him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Would get a trip to HP as a teenager and would lose the time with this machine and I would write programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvised innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> At several points in the interview, jobs talks about inventing new products in the process. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, as was devoted to sell a handful of collectors basis, a customer asked if I could ride the whole team. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the finished editing and the return of the devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while at Apple, remembers the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I have arguments dramatic agreement... I shouted required five years&apos; to create a mouse that would cost $300 &apos;, and I harté and I went outside and found a designer. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that was totally reliable and that we could build for 15 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies losing strength: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before that lead the revival of apple, jobs proféticamente foresaw the way in which many of the industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and lose control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Di trabajas in IBM or Xerox, so you better fotocopiadoras and printers, so what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The sales and marketing departments are increasing the success, so that it is this kind of people who end up running businesses and the people responsible for those products are expelled from the Forum for decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position it rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the necessary knowledge of the job. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have seized the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Could have been 10 times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Took the defeat of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> About innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea develops, changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> We learn much about the subtleties of the same. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrifices you have to make - some things that you ca n&apos;t do that make electrons, glass makes them, robots do things, factories do things. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You must maintain 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjusting these all at once... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> In the end it all comes down to taste - was reduced to trying to exponerte far better than a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things that you are your doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists stole. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have never been ashamed about stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> What did in large part to Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which incidentally was the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it were not for the computer, could be doing wonderful things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas cenan healthcare with opponents of the law while the court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether would accept the challenge to President Obama&apos;s health care law, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the signing of lawyers who will discuss the case before the High Court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study carefully the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question was a complaint lodged by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for the conservative activists across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Magistrates agreed to processing the demand and, in fact, a historic plea for five and a half hours is expected for March, and the outcome probably will further muddy the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time that the Court&apos;s decision is known. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will appear before the court and alegará that the law should be discontinued will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The signing of Clement lawyers, Bancroft pllc, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the Court&apos;s preliminary hearing on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Among the assistants were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The special guests at the dinner? scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And it is not something that conflict with the ethical standards. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges lower. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If it were not, you could say that fall under the charge 4C Code, which says: &quot;A judge can attend events to raise funds in connection with the law and other organisations, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, complete the proximity of scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges who closely follows the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of common cause - common cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were agasajados in a fundraising Gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that mixed too easily the Tribunal&apos;s work with agenda driven by groups such as the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&apos;s wife, ginni, is a leading conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is the magistrada Elena Kagan, who is an ethical issue, not scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan worked as woman Solicitor General for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented at the Court of First Instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pressed for Kagan refrain from view the case, saying that was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that it will. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing receives an order record of $18 billion </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The airline Emirates asks double corridor Boeing 777 50 aircraft, with an option for 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Rarely is it news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a great compromise when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of $18 billion. </seg>

<seg id="1694"> Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a spectacular fuel savings and services for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing,&quot; said the analyst morningstar Neal dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these clients in particular is very strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of the Middle East are the property of their oil producing nations. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;Have a natural protection,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of the solidifica Emirates Boeing&apos;s leadership in the fuselaje aircraft market breadth and helps ward off its competitor Airbus SAS&apos;s attempt to invade their dominance with the A350 airliner. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&apos;s victory in the air fair comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300er. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded a useful and increasing the burden of the rank. </seg>

<seg id="1706"> The sister of President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped his opponent the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favour of one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process yesterday and, above all, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa María Calderón during a radio interview a day after Sunday&apos;s vote. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;threatened our electoral candidates, our workers... took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote for the PRI.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> However, scene of a return, and the implementation is the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI has hopes of winning the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have overtaken by little room to Calderón, who had led the polls before the election. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderón, a candidate his brother&apos;s conservative National Action Party, or pan, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano aureoles left, the candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, came in third place, a major setback for the unfortunate and divided left before the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and metanfetaminas. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Is the President Calderón&apos;s home state, and he Michoacán chose to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> But the violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A mayor of bread was killed a week before the election as He campaigns for Luisa María Calderón, and many local candidates abandoned the candidacies of fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> But for the PRI, for unpleasant that seem Michoacán, a victory will help boost the party&apos;s elections. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Peña grandson, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: &quot;I think this victory should be very encouraging for the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The basd urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank - basd - has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development bank based in Manila, said that the world&apos;s two fastest growing large economies had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed up the recovery of economic bloc either directly or through the International Monetary Fund through bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Warned against the BRICs&apos; Brazil, Russia, India, China &apos;watching Europe&apos;s difficulties in a way &quot;impartial&quot; and said the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and resources long term European help to avoid a crisis in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all in this together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,&quot; she told the Financial Times in an interview in the context of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected to some extent, but can not be immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that is by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy&apos;s borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the world economy into recession and has led to calls for the major emerging economies come together to help the eurozone to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia is canalizaría through the IMF, but said that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of the bonds of the EU&apos;s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that &quot;India will do all it can&quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the collapse of exports and the depletion of the inflow of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;No one wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;is not an option, it is an imperative, because where are jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping the wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh varshney, professor of Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult sell aid to Europe for the one million two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;At some point you realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why the reserves of India is to be used to keep the numerous and well paid workers in the Greek public sector, poorly managed companies, in jobs and generate losses as the railways. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to &quot;chain&quot; important effects across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The Asian Development Bank&apos;s forecast of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia to 2011/12 now faces &quot;Risks to the low&quot; due to the threat of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Said that the vulnerable emerging markets &quot;contingency plans&quot; needed to do to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Pentagon&apos;s serious warnings about possible cuts in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts ahead could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, the channels of editing civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon is already digested by the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress can not agree on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> Said that the failure of Congress to come to an agreement on the budget and its consequence, called &quot;Abduction,&quot; would result in a 23 percent of global reductions and a high of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a large cut, indiscriminate applied in this way, making the most of our Naval and construction projects could not be carried out - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other efforts to modernize,&quot; Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We also would have to turn away many of our civil servants involuntarily, and because of that the reduction would levy so quickly, it is almost certain that we would licenciar civilians in order to meet the target.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes romperían faith with those who keep our army and dañarían seriously the readiness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts in time will reach into the combat troops, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While the financing for times of war in the accounts of contingency operations overseas is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption to the budgets of basis,&quot; Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be adjourned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in the United States as a major military power in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening when published the letter from Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a result with which they can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The abduction is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If the senators&apos; letter from Panetta and the recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls for exempting the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, despite that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary pintó a gloomy picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;is a boat without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;is an Air Wing without sufficient pilots trained.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening words in the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with the potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;In effect, invites aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta says New details of how the reductions &quot;generate significant operating risks: delay in time of Crisis Response, conflicts and disasters; severely restricts our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk of future of combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already testing and some only in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> That list includes the fighter f35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the new generation, The new ballistic submarine combat ship coastline and the new ground combat vehicle that the army and the Navy need replacing, the flying. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stop the additional development and testing of f35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that is the next vital step to improve and address the potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> As to detect a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and pervasive are deceit and lies in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each accused of lying to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjurio for allegedly concealing reports which said that a football coach was withdrawn agrediendo sexually abusing children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone at the US president, Barack Obama, stating that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The congressman for New York and exhibicionista in internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials quickly rebatidos by the irrefutable proof. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign relating to cover up a relationship extramatrimonial. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And, again, no one who lived will never forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Are widespread the legends about cheating on tests of school and university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers have given the responses of the exams for students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who should be showing otherwise are sending the message that lie and cheat are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much cheating us? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On an ordinary day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> That sure, many of these lies are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that the unknown mentían three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect lies, lies, &quot;or&quot; the location is an essential skill that everyone must buy, for reasons both personal and professional. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, charade, where the aim is crying out: &quot;You have serious,&quot; the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities that conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie has been rebatidos. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The Liars do look in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborizan or share. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> You can not conclude either that or expose the liars are difficult to detect. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A detector of lies coached may come to learn the truth about the structure of the Declaration, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Spent several years sounding out scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and growing body of knowledge, and was always clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigating our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include procurement, interviews, and the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars have the ability to read good for others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and feeling of intuitively how they perceive others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from the research that the extrovertidos lie more than the introvertidos, that men are more telling &quot;lies geared towards themselves,&quot; while women say more lies &quot;geared towards the other&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less frequently to their partners that people who are not married - but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot;huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How to know if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, watching the normal conduct of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> It&apos;s called &quot;creating a base line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Aid to provide benchmarks to measure after the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Watching the position of the subject, laughter and distinctive voice. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is better to know if someone golpetea normally with the feet all the time for not making accusations unfair when he sees the golpeteando feet in half of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then, find groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and not verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember its history, they can move their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, significantly changing its position or display a &quot;comfort postentrevista&quot; - that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the hard questions are finished. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Often the well makes out falsely that the interview is over only to find such relief postentrevista. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the last time while he claimed that his wife was murdered alive, launching a nationwide search for it. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The people who cheat can also use distanciador language: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman... the Miss Lewinsky fully&quot; or repeat a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language when&quot; to answer a difficult question: &quot;Well... In truth... so what I... in my view.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the response is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan from the pipeline diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - increasingly angry trade unions, while apaciguaba environmentalists - the company that wants to build the pipeline says that it is prepared to redirect the project to encaminarlo again. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on Monday evening that move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of sandhills in Nebraska, and hopes the project will win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision in a press conference in the capitol Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The manager of TransCanada, Alex pourbax, says that The company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until to identify potential new routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska sandhills and the aquifer ogallala, a vast underground water supplies. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real way forward,&quot; said the Nebraska representative Lee Terry, a Republican, to Fox news. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review ordered by the State Department, it is possible that besides any decision until 2013, after next year&apos;s elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department&apos;s request, and they expressed their full support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline, of 1.7 miles would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Would carry 700,000 barrels per day of the Province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do so would be to cross six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the sandhills region and the aquifer ogallala, the biggest source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The State Department&apos;s current environmental impact study found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department&apos;s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a firm that was contracted to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because he was linked to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti Labelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomitara of fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says that the music diva record, Patti Labelle, behaved like a mad in the foyer of his building in Manhattan, aterrando his youngest daughter to the point that vomitó of fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The singer of &quot;Lady marmalade diatribe&quot; fright to Genevieve monk, 18 months of age, both suffered &quot;personality changes, sleeping disorders&quot; and &quot;increased its fear of strangers,&quot; says his family in the Manhattan Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Was on 10 November last year when the tramoyista Kevin monk, his wife, roseanna, professor of nursery, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk caught the car, roseanna Monk fell at the entrance to the building of the riverside boulevard, with their luggage, driving Genevieve. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna monk said that stopped near the door and put her daughter in the soil for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone came from behind and I said, &apos;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&apos; he said &apos;yes&apos; and I went to take it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> A pregnant woman Labelle admonished angry. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;in an aggressive tone said,&quot; should not be left to his daughter near the door, &quot;said roseanna monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I said,&quot; I have no interest in what you say or think. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It angered and began to use bad words - the word C and J out... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Had a bottle of water and began to pull the bottle water on me. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1853"> He said that Genevieve was hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I say to this woman,&quot; Look what you&apos;ve done to my daughter, &quot;said the mother of the girl. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Labelle abalanzó on the mother - who still sujetaba Genevieve - and had to be restrained by their environment and to a car that the expected withdrawal, said roseanna monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The small was crying so strong that vomitó, added. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family Labelle sent a note asking for an apology, but received no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of Labelle not returned calls for comment on what happened. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family&apos;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it receives in a partnership of support for children with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The purpose is to make Patti Labelle responsible for their behavior,&quot; said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially when directed to a teacher of nursery that brings in arms to a boy of 18 months of age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Adversity climate has crippled the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario first Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and the irregularity, lowered the foreign investment and contracted the economy </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the history of economic Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario first Valdez, self-styled of change, which generated great expectations to developments in the economy, but given the start of the year, growth is not observed climate adversity, instead, it is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing losses for the agricultural sector, limited the ability of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in economic activity in general 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Afectaciones by frost, according to the report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, were damaged in 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which the 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07% took partial damage, the main victims were the vegetable crops, corn and garbanzo. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Until November, the fall in economic activity has generated a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography state the joblessness rate during the first three quarters of the year there was a rapid growth, because since January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, the rate rose to 5.28% for the second quarter, and between July and September the average continued rising to 6.19 percent, a rate that engages in number of people in more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, an increase compared with the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for The Economist Gerardo just Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, the growth of joblessness can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been made since the public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for effects of a restriction of resources on the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, for people who already agarra dollars illegally it is not easy for the work, the investing and deploy them in something,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2035"> That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from the 7:30 p. m., along with the band Angelina the X and the robertas nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> This is an excerpt from the conversation, the transcripts is complete in the nation on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For his followers costarricenses, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing his fan? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is only the second time in South and Central America and has so far been grand. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I was in Costa Rica only once and holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So excited us carry our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the gang, the fan live with intensity the days before. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you say to their most ardent fans? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for staying with us through all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even refers to his concert as the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> He adds that a little of the pressure off his visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the larger shows we have reached over the past 21 years occurred in the last couple of weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Touching a couple of shows giant in Sao Paulo and we hope that we are in form for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> In truth, we are very excited about playing there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How was that Costa Rica and discovered their waves to surfear? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have many friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in tamarindo and waves there are unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends are always going to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, by people who love the surf. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> To see the Tour, have been delivering shows huge with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have planned for submission in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never had that before, we do not have any restrictions on what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; try to touch a couple of each Album Songs and give our fan a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that is partially because we have nine disks and can interfere with more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we now not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because the reasons why reminds us that we liked these songs and that we may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that it is more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of history. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Looking back, is hard to believe everything we have achieved? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done for more than 20 years ago that looks like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We all want and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could n&apos;t be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What you meant to have been part of the emergence of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honour to be part of this group of big bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very Friends of the people of Soundgarden mudhoney and Alice in chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and is a rarity. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, there is a band of a city, but it is much more bizarre when five or ten gangs go at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honoured to be part of the Group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Yet touching with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in chains and were in Canada with mudhoney, saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Also it is very strange that a gang member such as you to remain united and with the same for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt - Cameron - we joined 13 years ago, which is, by itself, much longer than for many bands. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First, I think we are all fortunate to still be alive and, secondly, we all care for each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all very close friends and, thanks to this music, have also been open avenues that give freedom to each experienced. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of each one and could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> You&apos;s relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How are a record? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we have been growing, has been easier to strike a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We ensure that tour because it is not being too easy to fall into this game of the large crowds and the people who loves your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> While one remembers that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without encapricharse for being famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How recalls his other project mother love bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we write very good songs and at first it was a great thing. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after he died Andy - Andrew woods. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were many frustrations because inquiries of both and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce - fairweather - and Greg - Gilmore - which began with the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think in the incredible person that Andy was and how to make me laugh, it was always a pleasure to get to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an amazing human being and we were. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The band the National robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder, and that is why we chose for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we are most eager to see what the robertas can offer in alive and should be very entertaining. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why are always changing the letter of yellow Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for ED - Eddie vedder - so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings and I think it does so with the first thing that happens. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As downward, What are your influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many who could talk all afternoon on the bajistas which I adore. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has managed Pearl Jam keep relevant grunge despite not being a fashion? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think all of us grunge we are always a little disconnected from the floor. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think of her, reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, as mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time, and if there are relevant now, I think that is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening to music and as mudhoney gangs are now doing better than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why is this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem more livianas, but there are also songs, such as the end or just breathe that rank as songs very dark but may sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed I came, I wept when I heard them and are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that when far and there is some trauma in your life and you lose to a family or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and the two songs, no doubt, represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I believe that you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark. </seg>

<seg id="2168"> The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance </seg>

<seg id="2174"> The first three floors were the scene of massive festivities lasting up to two days and desesperaban tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> The side of the building there is a disco, balmes 51, which also has been damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%. </seg>

<seg id="2186"> The four were arrested at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond polemics on fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate about the role of collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Amediados 1980s, in full swing of the now defunct Barcelona City Corporation - CMB - this administration collserola printed a pasquines promotion. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Moreover, they came from a comparison, park in central figures, with the New Yorker. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again placed in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that Do n&apos;t point in the axis north but above - mountain - -abajo - sea. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The rating of collserola as natural park is in this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of the Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these was until, in September, the city convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for many other doors for access to collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that or someone seeks to put doors on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is: collserola alone, or mountain park? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both for its purely organisational side and thus poses of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the barceloneses architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Is now almost a recurring theme that use as two members of this ancient caste of elected were recognised in a lift. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this leads, quite rightly, one of the few overlaps between what they think three architects barceloneses, and university teachers, who have been presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel roldán, Daniel mòdol and Marta Bayona: The competition is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For roldán, after addressing the coastline &quot;is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;The Face of mountain,&quot; given that the speech of ildefons cerdà, of green apples, has not been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for their great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;ruling the architect for whom the title of&quot; collserola Doors &quot;contains a&quot; léxica trap &quot;: not to think of them as&quot; access to a park, but the division of some areas where we need to act. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, as roldán urban and Bayona with experience in the world, described the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers arising from the &quot;uncertain which is now projecting the public space&quot; after this experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the fòrum &quot;his swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first Fear is the demarcation of borders on where to build itself. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something is already giving the next step,&quot; that is, its sobrepaso. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;Housing must think in new instruments, planning, because the current metropolitan &apos;in reference to the overall plan - PGM -&apos; can lead to real disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Leaner to the question, mòdol believes that, simplifying the vallesana side of collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, of Barcelona, not merely,&quot; by a topográfica issue. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol recalls that there is already a collserola that work done by the patronat &quot;must not fall on deaf ears,&quot; although welcomes the opportunity that the city offers your body to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And even more, believes that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the licence which allows the architects to enter the debate, but &quot;Doubt&quot; about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the teams multidisciplinarios - &quot;a success story,&quot; notes - which have had to be created, &quot;the architects should be just a tool.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona insinuated that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the competition collserola lack a global vision: &quot;There have been 16 intersecting competitions says in the montaña-mar sense, but there is a longitudinal reading, to see and understand the area as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This causes, at least in his case, who has chosen to participate in the 16 contests. </seg>

<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of impact and the last entry of the aircraft&apos;s radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or disruption in the path of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of remains of the aircraft in a restricted area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far suggest that the impact happened on a trajectory and straight away. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of dispersal of remains of the aircraft suggest that the helicopter It was shocked by conditions on the ground in structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> There has not been found evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> At the site of the accident are still not be disclosed evidence in the remains of the vessel of some kind of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest research results indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the work of countryside have found pieces of the aircraft in an increase of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground has a slope that runs from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of bias. </seg>

<seg id="2267"> MSS announces protocol to find gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Directs the social security an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, is backed up by specialists from the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Security - IMSS - announced that runs an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called Protocol &apos;Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence&apos;, which can have markers associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the hospital&apos;s Medical Research Unit in biochemical of specialties of 21st century, Miguel Cruz his National Medical Center, explained that was integrated a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, social workers and nutriólogos. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> That team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health - Insp - and of the Centre for Research and national politécnico Institute of Advanced Studies - cinvestav - - IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In the investigation was invited to participate to the people whether or not they derechohabiente sports, go to the units involved in the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out to children, all Saturdays from the 8:00 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Sporting stressed that the Protocol began in the unity Cuauhtémoc - State of Mexico poniente - and that since 8 October, the sporting activity takes place in the unit nezahualcóyolt - State of Mexico East. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once they meet the goal of getting 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the sporting unity independence - Southern Federal District - and finally in the sporting unity Morelos - north of the Federal District. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Explained that the purpose of this investigation is knowing the components and the importance of the gene with regard to the development of obesity and identify Mexican risk factors in children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> To be held this 14 November World Diabetes Day, specifically stated that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, supervision and with the consent of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on eating. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Will also be asked about the physical activity and background heredofamiliares of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that triggered disorders such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Detailed measurements that Saturdays are applied to all participants antropométricas - weight, size, girth of care - taking blood pressure, glucose levels, triglicéridos determination, cholesterol and insulin and genetic - is to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cross just pointed out that this investigation follows the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;The health of 1999 and 2006 polls suggested that in just six years, in the case of children, there was an increase of 77% in obesity, and 47 percent of girls; in terms of overweight was also observed a dramatic rise&apos;, highlighted the IMSS specialist. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Indicated that the justification for the search of the markers in which underpins the country&apos;s population differs from others by their genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and African five per cent and this is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excessive weight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is the inability to burn the excess energy we consume - calories - and that is stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if present some degree of overweight or obese. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even, he said, the presence of folds of colour dark - acantosis - in neck and antebrazo, which indicate the likelihood that suffer metabolic disorder and until Prediabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered in writing to parents, who are each of the measurements and explains the lifestyle changes to be made to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cross just explained that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic disorders: the sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport rather than walk short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Also due to the high caloric intake, increased consumption of drinks azucaradas, carbohidratos - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburguesa, etc - with high fat and protein content and the genetic analyses in this Protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the temperature and environmental conditions </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signals it sends the road surface were met, would not need repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the metropolitan area in the valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera nájera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry - FQ - of the UNAM, who asserted that if the process of construction and maintenance of a road surface asfáltico is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in number, or even eliminated entirely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In its conference a technological view of the potholes, pronounced in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory to his office conducted asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with more mechanical strength, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera nájera estimated that this kind of asfaltos modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the training of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Explained that the asphalt, the main bulk of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight, asfaltenos calls, a low molecular weight, and other maltenos calls, which together give the road surface his characteristically viscoelástico behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelástico behaviour of asphalt is that high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts like a liquid, 120 degrees Celsius viscosidad is very high and 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt is quebradizo, added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but to be amended during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The FQ investigator observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by road surface flexible, which consists of six layers of material, the last three of which involve the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the most superficial layers is the TAR file, comprised of small stones covered in asphalt and then compactadas. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the piedritas said, which is the file is bañada with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> To use the vehicles and generated efforts, it permits the forces are very well on the road surface. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If they were modified asphalt is even better, difundirían believed chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Tar on the file, abundó, they put a final layer called file of Rolling Stone, which is made of a material Fine, that is, a sand is also washes in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the llantas vehicles, should have more mechanical strength to tar the file and provide friction in the way. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of the road surface which will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling file also requires having the right thickness and you must maintain the material that is complete. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the variations in temperature and humidity, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because tar significantly affects the performance of the file. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground is humedece, water spreads within the file and it is difficult to leave, it causes a reblandecimiento of all sections of the road surface and, therefore, the training of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a bump, he said, is the first to become blunt&apos;s film rolling tar and only then affects the file, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should attend to the first signs with proper maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Also a member of the national system of researchers explained that the burden used is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the road surface must always be on the burden used and ensure that it meets, often to avoid forming potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the Tar emulsiones, that even in other countries are already on the market and enable repair the potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What it lacked in the valley&apos;s candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that affected so that Melina Ramírez serna did not achieve the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The valley gets its title number 14 princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again the Cauca valley is left with the appetite for the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the gang that the show as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic stood out with the Crown and the rules, the Department has risen 14 titles of Princess and Melina vallecaucanas a legion of women who have been close to the crown but which were broadcast princesas including Miriam ospina Benoit - 1947 - clear Dominguez borrero - 1949 - Patricia Bellini Ayala - 1979 - Lorraine Alvarez - 1981 - Rose Mary alzate - 1983 - Olga Maria sands - 1987 - Leila blanque - 1988 - Monica Evers - 1989 - Maria take comfort Pinedo - 1990 - Diana Elizabeth Romero - 1993 - Giselle Garcés aljure 2000, Catherine Giraldo - 2007 - Stephanie Garcés aljure - 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question that many are today is what was lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite at each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, not for nothing was chosen as Queen of the police and better face Vogue Jolie, who gained queens as taliana Vargas qualifications or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor which is considered key to the decision by the jury to give first princess is that not convinced with its response to the question &quot;What is this book which has set it and why? You made by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the literary cart read. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The interrrogante vallecaucana responded: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I think quite in the literature, I think it is a form of culturalizarse childhood, I believe that the book that I was definitely is&quot; the principito, the book is quite deep. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now read &quot;Crime and Punishment,&quot; is a book of universal literature that everyone must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called &quot;The heat of the blood.&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that did little with &quot;culturalizarse &apos;first and second for not explaining very particular about how each of the books that have cited the set. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said feel comfortable and happy with the result &quot;The universe is wise is what needs to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people, please read a little bit, &quot;the principito &apos;is a great book&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the assumptions launched says that the valley burned favouritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist bogotano hinted that to be the favourite, the preliminary ovacionada and the candidate who took all the prizes - gastronomy OSTER challenge, the public vote for the best costume artisanal, and Queen Mother - &quot;That sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and therefore not excelled in the scene.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And that it showed in his first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> But in both lució safe, it showed that lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic itself showed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, Journalist of the programme &quot;at home,&quot; the channel RCN thought the fact that Melina be designated PRINCESS &quot;noted that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as Queen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Moreover, valley was to last very elusive with the press, and that was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another possibility is that valley failed to convince the jury on their interest in social work, which is to last, the essence of national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> For something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said that when they searched a woman committed to social needs of their country which. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, must look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, which before entering the contest are already involved in projects,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also there is speculation that valley was lethargic for their shortcomings in the derriere and the fibrosis that it notaba in her abdomen, but is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate &apos;natural beauty&apos; the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The queens preparador Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, &quot;but his problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the Truth for me was not very visible, I dropped points in the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido holes, with the magazine cromos sees the error of the vallecaucana were the surgeries that was inflicted. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgeries are good, But the valley is not known to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body was never his strong and here is the cost. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this award, which for the first time provides the National Competition of the beauty, after the parade in bathing suit was a cruel vaticinio last night was, but it said that this was the contentillo that gave him raymundo Melina for not giving him a taste of the Crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the fact is that Melina since today begins a year&apos;s reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives him the chance to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for designation of the national competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming step by Cartagena, was elusive crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Such was the work of the caleño which identified the corpse of Alfonso grey </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso grey.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officers is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November, a lofoscopista of Cali CTI went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the greatest leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonso grey,&quot; Through the comparison of their fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the CTI, this week&apos;s seccional him down the question &quot;willingness&quot; to eliazar González, a man of 21 years tejada port that has been working in the area of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the start of his career, González worked in municipalities collided, where many times had to start for more than five days in the jungle to arrive at the site in which the bodies were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 moved to the valley&apos;s capital, and then make the relevant courses, especializó in lofoscopia Skin, which is the study of friction, of Las Palmas in the hands and the feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of operational eliazar warned him against alias Alfonso grey minimum wearing clothes for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big is expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday in the night went for the Cauca in a helicopter from palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> Knew to identify two bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who went to the world&apos;s oldest guerrilla, so I asked you to carry the card decadactilar Guillermo León sáenz - his real name. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When, however, came with the research team at the site where the corpse was not recognized for his physical aspect, because it was so different from what he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Was without beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much leaner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But the signs do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> With a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a pocket torch, eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye was not ruled him: &quot;Alfonso grey.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man originally from Port tejada was mandated to confirm the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos pinzón, that it was the maximum leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactiloscopista sijín of Cali&apos;s recognition that did the President Juan Manuel Santos eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against &quot;grey,&quot; is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactiloscopia is an exact science, no margin of error, which may be key to solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support for crimes such as pickpocketing and murder investigations and confirm the identity of the people caught. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When caught, many criminals are false or bonds have no papers. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take them fingerprinting and seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Told the investigator that grab, in one case, it was taking away a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported their power to take a strong box full of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because there are no appropriate areas to make an impression optional, but in that case we could obtain the footprint of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator, who had participated in various hurtos,&quot; recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also discarded or reaffirm suspects in murder cases. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found a dead man, with bottles of spirits around them. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Through research, it was determined that a family might be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a footprint in the bottle is agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that was the killer, they located at the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactiloscopista of CTI explained that in the objects&apos; fingerprints are drawn with reactive chemical or physical. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When appear, is a transplantador or tape used to lift it. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After that, the perceptions are sent to Asif, who is the delincuencial database, or the registraduría. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented,&quot; said the expert from the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> Clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI. </seg>

<seg id="2381"> A large proportion met the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Members of the occupy Wall Street movement challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York to try to enter again, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square where they were evicted from early morning in Manhattan and in trying to occupy another park of the big apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators have agolpaban before zuccotti square, where wanted thanks to a court order that allows access to the &quot;indignant&quot; to come back in the place, while also responded to the movement&apos;s ouster occupy a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to come back on the square, we will install in some other place and continue the legal battle to return to zuccotti, as well as through granted and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the leaders of the &quot;occupy Wall Street&quot; movement, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray detailed the &quot;outraged&quot; that the response to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain acampados. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Moreover, the &quot;indignant&quot; proceeded to the occupation of a new park, located at the confluence of the céntricas Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to Holland tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> For at least an hour did take the place, but after the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the figure, while also assured EFD that saw several journalists who were handcuffed. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organisation claims that there are hundreds of people who had settled at that point, where they have already moved a delegation of religious leaders in show of support for members of the movement and that he tried to mediate with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, the zuccotti square - which is a compound owned by privada- remains closed pending the conclusion of a court case scheduled for this Tuesday in which they must investigate the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Posted some of the demonstrators have so far carried and distributed hitherto at these copies of that court order and even the delivering the agents who custodiaban square, leading to &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who claimed that some officers incumbents blows on the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The court order forbids authorities to remove the members of occupy Wall Street or apply &quot;laws that were published after the occupation began again or ban the demonstrators to enter the park with shops or other property that used previously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The Mayor Bloomberg indicated before the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the area to the public and the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to be installed with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The regidor defended the eviction personally carried out of the square zuccotti morning, an operation in which they proceeded to around 200 arrests and that was because the demonstrators were &quot;violating the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the place because it was turning &quot;in a place where people came to protest, but not to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to other people,&quot; because &quot;some businesses had received threats&quot; and neighbours feared &quot;for their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that in the Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that fund the American workers,&quot; added the movement&apos;s spokesman, who accused the mayor of &quot;lacking the respect for freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Those responsible for &quot;occupy Wall Street&quot; also indicated that are organising &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months for the protests, which began on September 17. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a television special Christmas </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Alongside Michael Bublé and other leading Canadian, will appear in the television programme &quot;It&apos;s Russell Peters Christmas&apos; on 1 December </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in &quot;home improvement,&quot; socorrista in &apos;Baywatch, &quot;conejita&quot; Playboy, &quot;the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special of the Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; - baladista - Michael Bublé and other leading Canadian, will appear in the television programme &quot;It&apos;s Russell Peters Christmas&apos; on 1 December by living in a very particular Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Today CTV distributed pictures of the television programme in which Anderson, also known by the wide distribution in a pornographic video landlord on the Internet, along with her husband, then a battery of &apos;Mötley Crüe, &quot;Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a pesebre a muñeco representing Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a renowned Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a broadcaster in part of the tour &quot;My violent torpedo of truth of Charlie Sheen, look like José.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2403"> In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special CTV account with the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March he married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model luisana lopilato, and that is no stranger to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot;tails&quot; to the American Kim kardashian during one of his concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan re-emerging after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in that part of the country nipón since World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Early estimates of the government in Tokyo cifraron material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure of gross domestic product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The recorded in the second quarter - to the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is, moreover, the fastest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery can be explained, in part, for the rally in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies increased their investment in 1.1%, compared to 0.9% decline in capital expenditure were observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unbroken rises. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the real trigger for the Japanese economy is not based solely on the momentum that Keynesian invited to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan&apos;s GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable escaló 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has been given to the internal market, when the yen - Japan&apos;s currency - has become one of the &quot;values&quot; haven nominated by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for us, a privilege that weighs as a bane of the life in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose survival is determined by the economic health of the technological large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, achacaron their weak results between July and September to the value of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets remain with their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of yoshihiko Noda not lower its guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;must be alert to the risks that persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic policy, motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And, indeed, the outlook is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - OECD - specifically stated that most of the member countries submitted in September more visible signs of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that advances the turning points in the global economy showed that the major Powers are slowing down. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> As it fell four tenths until the 100,4 points, compared to the 100,8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The euro zone, even, was below the average, which is in the 100, hurtling eight tenths level to the 99,13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens is to feed the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos says that the adjustments will be adopted, but the Conservatives did not sign any written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With soaring and the uncertainty reinstalada peripheral risk premiums in the parqués, Greece is enredando in the maze leading towards the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; Hellenic&apos;s new Transitional Government has imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a genuine belief of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and agreed that the period of 100 days in his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, antonis Samaras, claimed that under no circumstances will support new austerity measures and reiterated its call for new elections for the scheduled date, 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October,&quot; aseveró papadimos yesterday by opening a Parliamentary debate that will culminate with a vote of confidence tomorrow the new executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package with 24 programmes to boost jobs, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Not, however, the message of Samaras clears the doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader was a step further in their struggle to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that should unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needed, and made clear that will not give its approval to any letter of commitment to meeting the adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the órdago of Papandreou&apos;s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is strong: it will release the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties helenos does not sign a written commitment without ambiguity &quot;and as soon as possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman for economic affairs, amadeu altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return to Athens &quot;Very soon&quot; to discuss with the new government &quot;that is needed to pay for the sixth tranche of 8 billion, although there is no deadline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek knot still has up to now. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Mrs SOFIA: &quot;instruments for progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen is the &quot;dominant&quot; place of Spain in this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain has reached a &quot;special place globally in the role of the microfinance facility.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Mrs Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become these last two decades in the second donor of cooperation on this raises a tool, whose &quot;essence&quot; indicated that lies in being a &quot;tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen opened the fifth World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that there is &quot;no doubt&quot; That is kind of operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development goals set by United Nations with horizon 2015, and, &quot;especially one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, with revenues in the&quot; that sets the poverty line. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain continues to work &quot;to extend the network of beneficiaries&quot; to all corners of the planet, and takes this task with &quot;responsibility,&quot; said Mrs Sofia, who waited that initiatives and contributions that originate in the summit, which will run until Thursday, &quot;to ensure the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and particularly for women,&quot; major beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Many are &quot;achievements&quot; and &quot;many of the challenges we face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit of microcredit raises not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform to promote &quot;two basic goals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, His Majesty explained that it aims to that by the end of 2015 are 175 million poor families that have agreed to these financial services and that 100 million of those homes are out of the poverty line in which existing. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path started years ago so Pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, stress Mrs Sofia as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And this tool is that described the father as a &quot;universal idealistic admirable in the cause of the fight against poverty,&quot; whose work known for 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to see on the ground its lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> To this experience followed a year later the First World summit in Washington and other meetings as the celebrated in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;All I could see the continuing evolution,&quot; explained Her Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday described as the &quot;head of the&quot; family &quot;congregada in Valladolid by baquero of the poor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Mrs Sofia concluded his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &apos;moral imperative&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity is an ethical imperative &quot;for any democratic state.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, stated that it would be a mistake to link the cooperation with developing countries in good times, as it is a &quot;permanent duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that microcredit pose a serious policy and rigorous &quot;devoted to eradicate poverty,&quot; And now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under the principles of solidarity and not let it become a victim of the cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> For its part, the Secretary of State for international cooperation, soraya Rodriguez, applauded the &quot;success&quot; of &quot;confidence&quot; to give people &quot;excluded whom all the doors&quot;; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier lion of the Riva, welcomed &quot;opens its doors to those present to a city that infected the spirit of solidarity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes European electing the President by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union, CDU, on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without any great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Initially had not been included on the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who feel that the government&apos;s policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> For the 1.001 delegates, only nine votes against and 10 abstentions were recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation several minutes to be won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours Europhile, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, clear any possible doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main thrust of the Chancellor, and the motion, are outlined in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to make a breakthrough in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could manifest itself in Lisbon Treaty changes to allow strengthening control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly, it seems unlikely that the 27 quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him, and the leadership of the CDU also appear to know that Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the ball is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> On the other hand, the delegates have rejected the proposal by an overwhelming majority to weigh the weight of each country of the Directive of the European Central Bank under the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious to calm down within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is attempting to win his Congress at the expense of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or distressed countries prepared to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of &quot;friendship between France and Germany,&quot; Angela Merkel has not mentado France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in passing. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incidence of fraud in the sick leave </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the subsidies, the UMP and the government waged an offensive against the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, recurring since 2007, in the fight against fraud and the social ayudantía. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Moreover, to accompany such offensive, that part of the will to save of a rigorous, but still recalls an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Firstly, to implement budget cuts: The Government plans to force the private sector workers lack before they can take the low a fourth day. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In all, unless there is a specific company Convention, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that they would save 280 million, according to Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Moreover, be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic impact: enforce the officials a day of leave without pay in case of sick leave - so far, have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are being debated, the majority also again suggests the question of fraud, this time geared towards the abuses of parental leave. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;will substantially increase the controls, and if they find someone committing a fraud, must reimburse the amounts,&quot; Xavier Bertrand talking in the RTL warned on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seems slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Indeed, since 2002 is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies which would normally have borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not sick more than in the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Watch carefully, first, the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the French Institute of Social security - CNAM - In 2006, pay more than 237 million in benefits for low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute of Health Research and Documentation in economics, subsidies for the low represented, in 2008, 5% of health spending, rising to 11.300 million. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this sum, 46% for maternity and by industrial accidents, while 54% relates to the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.200 million. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Therefore, the 2.5% of spending on health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the soul Consulting Group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average which, of course, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management monster.com, showed that 75% of the French 40,000 employees surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of low by disease. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, in this case of the assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave took a shorter period than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were more prolonged. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work - both for health reasons and in other ways - varied, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison to the undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The fraud has a fairly limited scope. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 days are systemic. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, by 13% of short duration of the 285.000 made, that The casualties were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; that is, 37.050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the low of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of cases were &quot;Properly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with the game a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Therefore, it makes a total of 169.000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot; between several million workers who caught low by disease. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Certainly, a tiny figure compared with, for example, the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this in June, it would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, more than the total cost of the subsidies for low and, without doubt, considerably more than the fraud in the latter. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos adjustment: Greece must implement a new plan </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to save its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what you said on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas papadémos before Parliament; also added that the 100 days that have been given to his government of not Union would be sufficient to achieve that objective. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;for efforts that will lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,&quot; the head of the government, which declared spoken her first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on 27 October will be the &quot;primary task&quot; of the new government, as &quot;the permanence of the country&quot; is at stake in the euro zone, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly, papadémos has forecast that the country&apos;s public deficit will fall &quot;to around 9% of GDP&quot; before the end of the year, after reaching a 10,6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right rejects new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the head of the group on the right, showed his support for the measures already adopted on Monday to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not engage with additional austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;will not vote in favor of new measures,&quot; said during a meeting with members of his party &quot;new democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Said it was in line with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as to combat waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU does not necessary EUR 8 billion loan desbloquearían without a written assurance from the support of all the parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and not make anything because of outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> A committee of experts says that must legalizarse euthanasia and assisted suicide </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live denying death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian company is denying the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> In fact, only 9% of the Canadians are willing to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to that effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It is a formidable of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which had the participation of six experts in various fields, including the ethical, legal and the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends the government to amend the Penal Code in a way that allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient asks that option and has been judged competent to make the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> To begin, the experts cite a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada ranks 10th, the study found that &quot;the provision of medical care for the death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of the death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With or without medication, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated in the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And, although the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68,6% of them has just killed in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the highest rate in this regard in Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that are not in the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it wants to change the Penal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalised or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no proof that the fact that there are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its implementation, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or that had not given their consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn downie, co-author of the report, by teleconferencing said yesterday that, on the contrary, it saw more excesses in those countries where there have been legalized euthanasia or Assisted Suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;In Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;In Canada is assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians, favourable to euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Remember that 85% of the Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that allow people whose death is next to ease their pain, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> In addition, 66% believe that the fact of legalising euthanasia will not understand is worth less than the life of the elderly or disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people who have been on assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that there should be a process against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not as clear, as indicated in the report&apos;s authors. </seg>

<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of the experts who signed the report, partly because the practice of euthanasia is not confined to the sick in terminal decline. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years to ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; says Deschamps, he yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr Deschamps also highlights that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any other value of society. </seg>

<seg id="2597"> For the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security, Isis, is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and in other documents issued by the agency of the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Last week, the IAEA expressed its &quot;serious concern&quot; for a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to the IAEA, Isis, widely based on documents danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, starting in the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear Center in tcheliabinsk - oural - and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds for explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 and 1991, would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamantes&quot; in Kiev. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Introduction of a budget &quot;Golden Rule&quot; in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The grand coalition government Social Democrat / Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to put a budget &quot;Golden Rule&quot; in the Constitution to reduce the public deficit, and thus avoid a possible deterioration of the sovereign note of Austria by rating agencies - triple to. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner faymann himself, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure well above the limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If you reduce the creditworthiness of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, might have to pay $3 million more in interest every year,&quot; said the Foreign Affairs Vice Chancellor Christian Democrat, Michael spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria responds to a request of the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro zone of 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government asked the inclusion, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and restoring the balance of public accounts in the constitution or the law with equivalent value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The measure adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to &quot;German model,&quot; as Germany was the first European country that took this kind of &quot;rule.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Structural before 2017, the public deficit should decrease each year on a 0.75% of gross domestic product - GDP - and, from 2017, structural budget deficit in the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the comunas, should submit balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The aim is that, to 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> A strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threat with a new exchange market intervention </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The Japanese Prime Minister, yoshihiko would Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities intervene again the marking of change if the yen continued to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;shall be involved, as we did the last time, if we see that there is an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen,&quot; Noda explained to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen was to reach close to the record levels that produced the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo sold en masse yen for dollars to reduce the value of Japan&apos;s currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the American currency. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has gone remontando gradually since then, driven by purchases of investors who see it as a &apos;haven&apos; value in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2664"> On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations to 10 years reached 6,85%, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions on interest rates for the countries of the south, but also from France, are stoking the fears of the inspectors. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts must assert more than the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is one issue that can not be treated with considerations of short term or simply thinking about emotions, is energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Electoral is right that a meeting is the time to think about such matters and on the place of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate is only useful if studying all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinion on rational objective facts, in data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic trends will mean doubling the electricity demand by 2050, unless that depriving a huge share of the world&apos;s population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, must be filled the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore, Germany stands alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> That is not the case or Belgium, submitting it to able to replace it, or the need to find a source of Switzerland, which only aims at building last generation stations. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite examples, are moving with determination with their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, for their part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its Central Park, picking up the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes portrayed as example, reality is against such a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on Russia&apos;s increased need for imported gas, in particular, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Should meditarse on the case of Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion in the wind sector, which gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the wind&apos;s intermitencia; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a household electricity bill 40% higher than the French. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key component of the industrial competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the utility in the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear power would be a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would take realism away from the wonderful statements on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> It is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, are not always opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that our country&apos;s energy policy has built an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs lost director and 410.000 indirect jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Widely export oriented, covers a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and can create jobs not deslocalizables. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France decided to abandon nuclear power, would see the sacrifice of most of those SMEs and the loss of the six billion euros annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electricista undertake a EPR designed to operate 60 years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is a devilish source. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewables, shows the complementary nature of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, have a safety authority that exercises strict control and transparent on both existing plants and the construction of flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, recognised professionalism, are too obsessed with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one: the Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; caused no consequences for either people or the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some human error unforgivable. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Thanks to this progress and a security cooperation between the authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design which will resist such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Electric while I studied all the players who want to build a plant, the termination of its construction in flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF&apos;s competitors, as it would leave them free rein to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear industry. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> Legitimate is essential and seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogma and the partisan maneuvering dominasen such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised starting at various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of political figures, the compatibility of this with the self-appointed status of &quot;human rights&quot; country of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has come to the headlines, with the interior minister - see the newspaper Libération on 23 May - proclaiming past that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, workers waiters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> However, rarely seen from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The point is that, on this issue, there is enough consensus between the left and the right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidance declaring in 1976 &quot;900 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers,&quot; while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard, explaining that France &quot;can not take charge of all the troubles of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden for the French economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the level of generosity with the acting on immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the joint development will solve the problem &quot;of migration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, it is economically profitable electorally, but perhaps is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the economists point out Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that sums up the latest knowledge about immigration - Exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp., there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of the migratory flows in economic growth, employment and wages in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limitation of immigration weakens and harms the employment growth. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace domestic workers, particularly the unqualified, pushing to reduce their salaries. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are rather complementary that substitutes for national workers and have mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national and the most qualified workers in dynamic sectors where does not meet the demand for staff training. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country which has lack of anestesistas, complementarity between national and leads to the arrival of recent immigrants will impact positively on wages and employment of the National. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Taking into account the above, Giovanni peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows presents a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that bring immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth - there is a large proportion of American Nobel laureates naturalizados and companies like Google, Intel, paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, since they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, for example, an immigrant to arrive with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution - income less expenditure - of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that it was &quot;with the teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These teeth, people to immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, you only have to think in a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember this because, although was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century world has suffered the tragedies of war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some believed that perhaps, for democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies, be enough exercise the vote and the most direct way possible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, from the &quot;small&quot; Napoleon, that it was a thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, although this is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and even can become an instrument of oppression, &quot;as&quot; said formerly Republican philosopher Etienne vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Not, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of the powers, an education, lights, solidarity, social and economic justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The current crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but is about to become a democratic and political crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The referendum palinodia Greek verdadero-falso had, in this regard, revealing a double effect: it showed the need for a strong return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of his failure, his inconsistency. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> We should consider modifying this ambivalence to overcome it. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the lines of the front of the Democratic battle now have shifted and, in many cases, soldiers Republicans no longer moving in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Not stands to gain If we demand a succession of national referendums, organised according to the needs and disorderly manner. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free rein to the absolute monarch European nationalist or a high off the hole: what options for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want to draw heavily on full effect, but a joint exercise, calm and continuous, options, and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - in fact, we would know where finish the list - because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The whole of Europe is that yields to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which already suffering from Its impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international arena. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is slowly across Europe which loses the sovereignty and, with it, each of their nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The most urgent is the Popular sovereignty to the helm of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because only together can reduce the weight of its debts, Europeans from the markets and prepare their future through investment. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that can not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Having long struggled against this proposal from the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now a European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So be it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think of it without further political integration and democratic, and that is seen as such by the people, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new stage of European integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To build the Republic in France, we had to &quot;do&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson still applies. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Building a more democratic Europe can only be achieved at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To build Europe, do Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Cards with chip &quot;without contact,&quot; generalizan </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The salon&apos;s global chip cards will begin on Tuesday in villepinte, near Paris, on a positive environment. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocesadores - bank card, with SIM cards, etc. - phones, with a total of 6 million units, according to estimates of the Cabinet eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The segment of the technology is the most powerful without contact, which allows pay Transport in common or simply relating the card purchases to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year will be sold throughout the world 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Its quota should continue to grow in 2012 - 580 million units are planned - and represent about 10% of the world market for cards with chip - 6,925 million cards. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe, which has long behind the Pacific region, is gaining ground in the field of payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Around 26 million bank card VISA already have this role, which is accepted in 75 payment terminals. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visa cards are being used without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But working for four supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million MasterCard cards pass without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> In order to get the gear, however, it is necessary that the banks made available to its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;There are two big French establishments that are committed to disseminate systematically in the future, among its customers, bank card with the system without contact,&quot; announces Gérard nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> The banks tested the payment by mobile phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> At present, there are few devices equipped with the technology NFC - near field communication - essential to make transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They are rezagando.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But should finally undergo a real boom next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 all over the world,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, President of eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The bank Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in fall. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> It equiparán the iPhone around 200 customers and staff which enables the payment without contact with a founded. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The bpce has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing an offer that allows its customers to pay the marketing without contact via your mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Sahara to Nigeria, the face of terrorism is growing </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the boko Haram sect. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - aqmi - and the sect boko Haram, on which the Nigerian suspected for some time, have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> The Algerian Sunday, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even argued that Algiers&apos; already has the certainty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which both organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,&quot; he said, without providing further details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with aqmi, Antoine de léocour and Vincent delory died the following day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Axis terrorist </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The calls made the study indicates towards various partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale - RFI - two numbers captaron especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained long in MAIDUGURI, a city in Northern Nigeria, cradle of boko Haram, and the other to a man who, allegedly, is close to aqmi and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is progress, but surely we should expect to have more formal tests before talking about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial support and intellectual and becoming more active,&quot; says Kunle Nigerian amuwo, a researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months, these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of boko Haram or in their operational modes, which involve the use of Assassins or explosive devices now increasingly complex and in the same way as those used for aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington, is pushing abuya since then to that takes into account the problems created by boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considered worthy of the group as a community of enlightened little interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A quick success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in MAIDUGURI on a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam in Hausa, Mohammed Yusuf, boko Haram - which means &quot;Western education is a sin,&quot; encourages the establishment of an Islamic sultanate in Nigeria&apos;s Muslim north. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Is politiza and demanded a strict observance of the Sharia, while their militants throw themselves into the fight against the central government godless. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> They go first to the churches, pubs, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Boko Haram in 2009, the militants were particularly active and increased attacks on police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of abuya was, as is usually the case, widespread. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army attacked the city and 800 deaths were recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the sect radicalises, abandoning their northern strongholds. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Christmas claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos, and then another in abuya. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, boko Haram again attack against abuya, in particular the protégé of the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations is made in his first international goal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, covering from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, affects all the security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali al-chebab operating in Kenya, boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé has warned him against boko Haram and said he was willing to &quot;share all the information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> On China, with Iran and support for Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> A weakened by the crisis, America can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think so. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are increasingly shortcuts and estruendosas statements on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Spread mottos, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the &quot;grand old party,&quot; has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and &quot;denouncing them for manipulation of its currency,&quot; a key issue in a Latin exasperada by the Migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> No matter whether that means the explosion of a trade war, said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that &quot;apabulla emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Has called for a firm, but constructive dialogue with Beijing - Obama&apos;s current position. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which is stalled in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The style of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I leave elected, go to Iran,&quot; fanfarroneó. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is reelected, will have the Bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed to meet their obligations in connection with that partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The businessman Herman Cain, the second best classified candidate for its part, shows an embarrassing lack of such issues. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, urged China to counter the military threat because Beijing &quot;is trying to develop nuclear capability,&quot; Apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the atom military since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The swagger Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and want to intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is prepared to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, it also promotes Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> Are considerable differences with the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan was also simple ideas and who won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Remember that Obama was himself an amateur and who had to lose the pistón in combating terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> Rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty departure of the &apos;Boys&apos; in Iraq and in its misrepresentation in Libya, and the label of weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attacks are not straightforward. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population judges in a positive way rather Obama&apos;s stock of national security, that ended with bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> From Iraq, is wary of military interventions that create a collapse. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And economically, arguing that we need to rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, connecting directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is already in service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> Must deliver gas to meet the needs of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate Bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline connecting directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark rutte, have focused together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, each additional year will arrive 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to Western Europe through a first took 1.224 km linking the St. Petersburg region with the province of mecklemburgo-pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012 that will provide a total of 55.000 millions of cubic metres of gas, enough to cover the whole French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube for the same journey. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project presents redolent of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the Baltic States were strongly opposed to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, Nord Stream will allow land supplying gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course to third countries - Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries lose some of its power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia amenazándola with close access to the markets of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new German-Soviet Pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to fill Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the price is a weakening of the Energy Europe, given that the Project has created a rift between the Eastern and Western Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In just five years, Russia has managed to succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and Western countries rich, big consumers and gas reserves in ever more limited. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new organic form that unites us,&quot; confirmed François Fillon artery during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing how the big gas contracts are both political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in lubmin gas, at the point of arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The handset is made of steel, cement recubierto submarine to protect it against the anchors of the ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Rests on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m in depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy 100 of them, by caution,&quot; says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Also, was necessary to step up the protection measures of the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The handset is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted its entire length: either by valves, or maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Control was scheduled a platform in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project resigned to it to see that The Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company was placed permanently in the sea off the coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of breakdown, stop the passage of gas in less than a minute,&quot; precise Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of brain, the gas pipeline, therefore, will be released into the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But the builders considered unlikely to happen junturas a brain, as planned, according to forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The state&apos;s control of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged by a foreign vessel, which carries out inspections, as well as by a device that travels on the inside of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> In the shape of a pure, inside the tube is inserted, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on possible deformities of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline is designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any kind of repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The circulation of the gas is simply guarantees by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The principle is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to undertake this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> To her, they joined the German E.ON and BASF - 15.5% each, as well as the Dutch gasunie and the French group GDF Suez - 9% each. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, commissioned to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Is based in zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Later, Gazprom alquiló to this society, for a renewable term of 25 years, the whole of the gas transmission capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay him for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really accurate,&quot; Jens Müller transport. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline have been carried by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% through bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 million for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, has reached 240 million investment. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are sure to not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone running the risk of spending. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The Baltic gas pipeline emerges in lubmin, in a sandy coast pine planted. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Some valves, with 4.5 metres high, are the exit door of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, will be in 2012, six million and three million per hour. </seg>

<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, as the report card attracts both businessmen and students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Like moleskine open spirit, its users are cosmopolitan, and cults. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its outset, now has around 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> Distributed its basis in bookshops, from The Fnac to small shops in the centre of cities, and has been able to impose their identity. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers is still so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a public policy firm, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No,&quot; says Mr Blanchet, adapt, Director General of the association which organises the week for the employment of disabled people. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress achieved in 15 years are considerable. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, there is still much to be done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It is worth mentioning that the unemployed Disabled still face numerous obstacles to access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Tend to have a more advanced age: 37% has over 50 years - an average of 17%. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Have a high level of qualification little: 80% has not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long term unemployment is rife among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> That is, there are many issues that hinder especially the return into the workforce and that &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; says Christian grapin, Director General of tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help companies to hire workers disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> These are the obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mindset of the people is progressing, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study in April by the Association ims-entreprendre cited for the noted that managers surveyed are &quot;a low level of knowledge about the disabilities,&quot; with an &quot;excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, which... was set by law in 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> According to the latest figures available from 2008, achieved a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now reached about 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of AGEFIPH, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The test: the number of establishment &quot;subject to this contribution,&quot; like the funds disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46,000 structures - and of 606 to 480 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law in 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure on companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially among the large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies that have between 20 and 49 workers has disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82% of businesses of between 100 and 199 workers. </seg>
