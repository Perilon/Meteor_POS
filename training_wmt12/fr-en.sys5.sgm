<seg id="1"> Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the project of cancellation of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Members have declined in the second reading of the draft amendment reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently in prison. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymosenko describes the judgment of political revenge of the regime and has caused a process of suspicion of bias of the court also to the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former First Minister was sentenced, has been signed by 147 Members. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Libyan Victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The release or Libyan rebellion already has his vanquished. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It remains to determine the winners. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The National Council has declared the customary law of Sharia law and we already know what it is. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya is a country without crime, because for a flight, the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women can forget the emancipation, not respectful of the faith face the death penalty... </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is the Koran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of tribes opposed. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Libya, such an order as we cannot we represent and we would certainly not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted the help with recognition of dogs infidels. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only excuse is that this is not a U.S. general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the greatness in each attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not part </seg>
<seg id="23"> We have involved the firing, served Islam and our policies are diverted the dictator as a political ally without bringing any benefit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is no problem for the premises to get rid of the &quot;crusaders.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Is that without occupation of soil, oil companies have easy access to Libyan oil. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Perhaps not as much and the West can finally boast an unselfish protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If we prevent these followers of Sharia law. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The feeding of a child obese: does not take breakfast and takes the deli for lunch </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children from 9 to 13 years have problems on weight, 9% of pupils are a weight in the - above the average and 5 percent are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As the current research obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This shows once again how important is the environment in which the human being and models that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children is by example of the deli 50 percent more often than in the families of children with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of obese had fries at the dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of small big sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15 percent said that at least once a week parents found time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey on 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 students of primary schools of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of the &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot;, supported by General Insurance and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the start is more than 12,000 students from sixth to third that project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in on weight or obese, is the lack of proper food and not enough physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half the children interviewed indicated by example eat five times a day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea party, which is a basic principles of good nutrition,&quot; said one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and dinner deli </seg>
<seg id="91"> Specialists draw attention to the fact that a healthy development takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of pupils to eat my same hour. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families each takes his breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey showed that in the families of the obese children consumes more often unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every pupil - not to mention weight – drink every day from sweetened drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> More than 40% of children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Bring you your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the investigation has allowed children chosen (204 172 boys and girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from options, according to their taste and their own personal opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of Czech children 12 to 15 years are far, in terms of a healthy diet, the ideal.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favourite meals there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The more alarming is a large preference for sweet lemonades,&quot; is indicated in the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch the pasta who took first place just before the white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The children were not want starches and preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Cape on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The investigation has also shown that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the ad hoc information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;During a control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the session awareness&quot; Obesity is not a chance &quot;, there was a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet,&quot; the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most striking example was the sweetened lemonades because children have begun to give preference to water consumption. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children were most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce the dishes and sugary &quot;knedliky&quot; (Czech speciality flour balls of bread or potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer should also be a good psychologist, say professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In a presentation on the way to learn for the designers, I put myself a little angry because there was a lot from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I didn&apos;t what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The presentations of three professionals, specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is going on. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly &quot;packed.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the director Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the on weight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer should know how to reduce arms optically, extend a neck or add necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We arrived nicely to emphasise the character and also not to pay way too ostentatiously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is a difference between the waist and hips so that skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to do it. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you will never regret it because the clothing that is impeccably is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt on able you will feel much better than in the slips, is enroule and does not take the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a male appearance can afford a lifestyle clothing Tucker, with pieces of tissue producing rather threadbare, and even embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am pleased that I have all week to sort through all the information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also fear that because I have to do at home there too. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality and his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will have to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know the campaign the Secret of Victoria. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Basically, it gives me pleasure, because it is better than dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost 100 kilograms lately (don&apos;t take my statement, above, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the internet, print and graphic design work. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The Moodboard, as we said to the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Think also on the part of the graphic styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The designer dresses and did not only physical but creates the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, has spoken of it all. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But this... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer should have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three guests of specialty have given a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, Jakub Polanka, designer and fashion designer Ben Renc, fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a designer of talent is working with a single dress differently. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is to this example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As for example the trench-coat who must be brought a classic with a jeans and a T-shirt as a light coat but it can also clothe the naked body, with court shoes and photo taken as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Concentrate on with this,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I particularly appreciated the following advice: &quot;For the work you need to know the rules well.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You can then begin to infringe,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines you see sometimes something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on the fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have a lot more variants of clothing that those who are photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That is to say that for fashion story which will have a dozen pages (a dozen models) I must be ready to &quot;retailler&quot; at least a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, a garment and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We must reckon with it during a creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains cautious. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is enough that I know something but what I sound going on in the second grade). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone is making a styling on our part, we must rely on the fact that he dictates with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he has in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It is then that surfing Google and ensure Boulevard if the news of the celebrity in question, if it has shrunk or grown etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario we have asked Sunday on the heart that it is not enough to move in designer fashion and assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> It must communicate with the people he dressed and it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Knowing guess people, not flatter, keep his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fulfil new elements you can&apos;t just throw everything and say, My God horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find few cases that you find beautiful and conseillerez with what you wear them,&quot; said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us specifically what must contain the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or the designer bag. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is the one you cling around the size and that you have on you for everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Besides things clearly defined as the scissors, rolls to dépilation or to pin the nanny, there is also the nylon thread (the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, hats or special clips), with which it closes a garment in the back, if it is too big (the pin or other type of clip are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For that we are not just people who listen but who tried something practical way they taught us how shoes re-soled properly. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could crashing, especially outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we have stuck, and stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We did not have the right to receive the scissors not to hurt themselves inadvertently. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It therefore really need skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario made me happy when I was congratulated for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The competence of which I am a state is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of course </seg>
<seg id="178"> I began to understand that the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The need for speed The Run to row across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Revision </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without a problem turning because of a series of errors stupid people who have nothing to do in a routine morning trip to work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> This meets up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new party under squad - The Run produced great expectations before his exit. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already old and out a kind of game from jouables parties that would not only with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were therefore curious how will be the passages added during which the main hero out of his car and done what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As it is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> These are potentially games arcades race but all gets to the bottom because of some unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It is not really mistakes, but rather the expression of a laziness incomprehensible from developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has problems characters and to resolve them is to participate in illegal races across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting points. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that each race on another route and stages in different environments which are quite far from each other and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player did not feel that the game he proposes something similar. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are also cute enough even if the technical level chart is the same type as the previous rounds. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally, this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving through the desert in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-covered mountains is very nice visually. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are more from time to time with a atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you significantly reduced visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains you should pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition to that the different races are well arranged one behind the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There is only a small number but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are moments you strive to surpass the number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the clock) and then still you expected another duel with an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time you also the police who enters the game and trying to make the difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty are the passages out vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is rather an interactive animated when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you must help typing on the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising is that there is less moments of this type that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> The result is good because this will not hinder and, in the context described above, it - in the elements that dot the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The pattern is in the tradition of previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we cannot say that this is negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> As regards the realistic simulation you have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But while we can find better in the competition the pattern goes very well with the type of design races. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So everything is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems begin to emerge after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the pattern, that collisions is not yet at the point. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We do not expect this game a distortion complicated and collisions, but when you have not, in a collision with any object, any idea how has your car, this is not completely right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> During tight overruns sometimes you touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in the mad process. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or is in tatters. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system... this is not really a problem but it really riles you. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The revival is so that when you&apos;re phut or you&apos;re out in the context the game brings you back to the time of the last point on the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you do just that 5 redémarrages. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you used the 5 redémarrages you have to start the game since the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is therefore more a tool for the case where something is not happening as it is, something on which you can really count. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes the redémarrages do not help and it must find a solution recalling from memory the piece itinerary. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The big catch of this game is that the same actions are in the same scene. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example there are some turns that it must pass a certain way if it does not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you meet on a given location of the vehicles &quot;civilians&quot; always in the same configuration that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What angers the situations when you see the move easily between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and circumvent or curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> That is equal if you go to the - before him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; so that the situation there always comes close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents also have other benefits. </seg>
<seg id="233"> For all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent ahead in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> It said the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The adversary must to go before you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it happening to you you hiding the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you walk in collision a number of times. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a pity because through a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and places with such action that you don&apos;t have time to follow everything that happens. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And it is equal if it is because the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change of car during races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must pay attention to the gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>

<seg id="276"> Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs are négativistes and Euro-sceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I was not expecting a war as hard.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;This will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all the players are used to their new role,&quot; it is Miléna and Vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="281"> When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles might envy, she showed how she takes her motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe&quot; very seriously. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;From the beginning echoed the criticism that he is bland, that it is a wrong - - leather, he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say it has cut the breath to everyone because it takes its role to perfection.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;This is a man who knows listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="285"> She said the new post of High Representative for foreign affairs and defence policy in the framework of an answer to the question: &quot;Who is that the European Union?&quot; &quot;At what phone number must - I call?&quot;, as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater clarity of the Union policy address to the states, as is China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked to that feels very strong) </seg>
<seg id="287"> Madam Vicenova also reported the agenda that has lived, lives and live in a time close to the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="288"> She called the Czech Presidency of two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czech Republic have solved the financial crisis, rising gas crisis or have organized a summit for a Partnership Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She called the government&apos;s fall very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the Ambassador Madam, &quot;activity has beaten its full&quot; not only for the Presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> It must also approve the new seven-year budget of the Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> As it seems that the budget will be thin and economies, which branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is solved in the framework of future negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Madam the recalled its ambassador slogans with which she arrived in Brussels &quot;For a Europe understandable.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I really don&apos;t foreign words, abbreviations, jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no gherkins or twisted round, bananas differently large or that nobody has forbidden to make syrecky. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="298"> She wants to make better use of the environment of the EU and see more Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> A multi-speed Europe we expected </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and people who do things that in their negative aspect that positively. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Moreover it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the Czech Presidency success she then stressed the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, when I come to the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French said to me: &apos;Hey, what are you doing here - low, that is still the Visegrad group?&quot; and he is not happy at all. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future are tough new rules on budgetary policy who expect the member countries. </seg>
<seg id="306"> This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, rather than a &quot;new European Federation.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="309"> First it was said that cooperation between the countries who want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be a lot of this type and there will be a Europe at two speeds,&quot; really expects Madam Vicenova. </seg>
<seg id="311"> From this point of view it was also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not just the members of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> History of a mark: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone were to seek the word which expresses the closer the strategy IBM, the closer the &quot;long term&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and however since its creation it has passed 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;PENSE &apos;!&quot; became the footprint around which will develop the life of a giant future (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> For we thought IBM means a long-term, continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived hundred years thanks to the fact that she was always faithful to its core values and however has not been afraid of change all around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more, &quot;said the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A system well prepared </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after its employees as Bata Czech Republic - people of IBM were the only among the first U.S. employees have paid holidays, paid by the employer insurance a uniform of employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and commercial. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Similarly IBM has a system of relations with the client well developed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talent - as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> This works at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the post of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years is what we call jamy, the online brainstorming from what is a lot of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500,000 people who work. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is the internal and external image of the company that provide him a secure position in the areas of business. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather institution that a technological firm Rosabeth Moss Kanter,&quot; said, an economics professor at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems of the world of business using its technology,&quot; said George Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Great Blue,&quot; as it is familiarly in the United States for his slogan - in 100 years it has grown up to become one of the largest global firms. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services of Council at the level of the server products until nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> She owns numerous patents of all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its findings stands for example the distributor of tickets, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM found itself this year with 220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> These are not all the innovations and manufactures who have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example failed betting on an operational system own OS / 2, the online Prodige service or IBM computer PCjr: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;From the moment where your business is built on the movement in advance you can&apos;t émotionellement stay hooked on the past,&quot; noted Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on a flat - forms and when they do not work it is going. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In the difference by example of Microsoft competitor at the base is and remains under the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the income IBM, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However in 1990 it was with more than half the height representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000 IBM has sold assets to poor performance for 15 billion, over that period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technologies prospects. </seg>
<seg id="351"> She continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of his first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It now appears that IBM is the current crisis without interference? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The share price IBM grew from 2008 in rocket 120%, net income of the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the firm IBM is to change all but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> We can expect to this flexible giant control other crises. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: From the slices of cheese until the flights in the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="358"> The International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York 100 years ago; it was originally the name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation complicated. </seg>
<seg id="359"> She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the ten year 80 of the ninth century. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They had technologies such as the old &quot;pointeuses,&quot;... which was the arrival and the departure of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint that until 1930 chaired the Council of Surveillance of society. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint dispatched the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The leader was then to shadow the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the firm until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as its name, began with the production of all the machines for business and trade - trancheuses cheeses and meat until the cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years in which Watson headed, turnover has multiplied up to 9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was irreplaceable if the firm after 40 years of leadership is his son who held the director&apos;s chair, Thomas Watson Jr. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s people and computers from IBM helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System / 360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The PC classic that hastened the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM sells its manufactures computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to handle advice and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that succeeds in IBM these past three years - is the concept Smarter Planet &quot;a smarter planet.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> His goal is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transportation and management of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the area of trade IBM has developed there was little time a platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; trade, which helps to manage the business cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history on our territory. </seg>
<seg id="378"> She created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first countries of Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic centre of outsourcing of Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The Central for Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague and there is also the research and development team in the world of speech recognition. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it is finished! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and to return home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepa can return home, but not as my partner,&quot; said Rychtarova. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in was Bartosova in his home, she had no idea that the couple would not. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move to Ricany, Pepa does not repoussa the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> And he confessed in public that he loved. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With time Darina has resigned, has accepted the affair of her husband and eventually tell him goodbye forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychtirova is not interested to know who her husband layer. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If Rychtar and Bartosova are there will be no wife to host on the door of the house. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;This is the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,&quot; Rychtarova filter showing that it is detached from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I respect the decision of my wife.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I will stay with Iveta and will not change.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect that.&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="401"> If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;We do not couchons together and it doesn&apos;t interest me to know where it goes, with which and if she has an affair. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I know that this is my fault, I fell in love with &quot;Iveta on me and I take full responsibility,&quot; said Joseph. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices women: This applies to you too? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to determine vices typical of women, all, each as others, are able to get out &quot;of their run.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear ladies, you&apos;ll know in the following lines of female defects that come to pump blood veins of men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> The purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Devez you buy at least a garment by week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are simply buying and packages at the time of the balances? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case we can talk of purchases as a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you say, which could stand - window licking at clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colours)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And although for most women buy a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Remind you just how many times have you told your spouse that he expected the entry... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Insatisfaction constant </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too big?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make the sport?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;I like you?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These sentences not remind you something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> You are part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> This is not the question that you should stop look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain of his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The male does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become empoisonnantes. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The order and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is like a merry-go-round infinite. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Laver windows, vacuuming, cleaning up the soil, dust, the higher-grade bathroom - and this twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have tarnished the sink, encrassé the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> In case you suffer precisely this obsession, try to remember that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness must not be in the first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This desire inoffensive cleanliness can spoil your relationship and family peace. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The work of undermines </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Met this spent tracksuit to the dustbin.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You accounts put these old socks again tomorrow?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;A wet towel has nothing to do by land.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you do on your partner this undermining this way several times a day, you really break. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It is obvious that you don&apos;t think you want everything to be flawless. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps if the men knew, women would not have to do both of undermining... </seg>
<seg id="438"> The defamation, the persiflage </seg>
<seg id="439"> The defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone also own some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are still particularly to relations and are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps each of us escape a small persiflage harmless here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on heart that is a feature of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise and are for their entourage - particularly at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jagr and Voracek helped by their involvement in the Philadelphia victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The striker hockeyiste Jagr has participated twice to the victory of Philadelphia for Monday&apos;s game on the ice of Carolina National and is again in top Czech players productive for the competition. </seg>
<seg id="446"> From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has made a pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr has also recorded two goals during the game. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr after the match told reporters overseas that he had warned Giroux that this would be a great evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I felt.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Some time this feeling is upon you,&quot; said Jagr after its action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes&apos; goals for the puck and presented the Maxime Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the break, the first local player Patrick Dwyer made a downhill, but the beginning of the second part served the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically to Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr it marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I don&apos;t want to say that it is the best player in the league but it really is part of the top three,&quot; said Jagr at its centre. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I never thought I end playing career with a hockeyiste like him.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I&apos;m really happy with that.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play him.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All these years at the National team players have tried to play on me, now it&apos;s my turn,&quot; said Jagr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Caroline was a tragedy of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and new Dwyer on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of one goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read has not ruled out other complications that ended two to one. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The Canadians have not held a experienced defender their lead to two goals and lost after shooting a penalty by 2: 3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is the fact that the line back was sick which was particularly bothered the local coach existed rather than lost because they played the game with only five defenders. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;It is nil.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We have played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing to do, it is like that,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacement on replacement this was not enough and we have not been able to resist.&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="481"> How have evolved prices trips since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agencies offered trips at the time, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because the trips to the west were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a liking for the western and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited to the Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialist era, was that he was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In cases where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually by example in Poland or in the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation or travel individual was not authorized. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel agencies at that time also provided trips to the West, however, he had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after it was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for the currency was the condition to travel to the west was refused to people &quot;politically incorrect&quot; who couldn&apos;t travel. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czech currency was not however exchanged with others and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) for travel to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czechs were the more often their holidays in the countries where there had therefore many houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and this habit lasts until now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Czechs travel have known since 1989 a great revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs have spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in the countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox which we have not aware today is that the most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits short-lived especially in Austria Vienna and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could not long travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris the travel organisations were sleeping the Czechs in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was winning with his own food, tinned sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna which has enabled our tourists finally after dozens of years to freely buy the currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our level of life as well as the average wage rose which caused around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare rounds with air charter service through contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what was there before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s of the last century, the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries of the world to share the EU who later helped our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting time in the history of tourism, when post-révolution was prepared the first air charter to a country exotic, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year as each year of direct air charter take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> That is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Once an interesting time in this period which symbolizes our development post-révolution arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008 the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to pull completely in the group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15 000 crowns per person for a vacation abroad including charges annexes. crowns per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President but this will be completed by a situation without solution &quot;a pat&quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> Nearly 5mois already the Czech football is without President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held Thursday at Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> However there is still no agreement on what to vote to proceed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This is completely shown on 16 September when he had to choose a new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the General Assembly gathered unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and it has not even been issue to deal with how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or the officials also have full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point there was a partial agreement since this moment with the help of the Bureau for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The differences continue always about the regulation for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned negotiation or extraordinary, has brought nothing to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the underbelly remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed to the third round not to fall into the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model,&quot; noted one of three vice-presidents of the Association of football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda which represents professional football within the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the model expected wins in the third round that candidates who received the most votes in percentage within the Board for which he is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw that wins the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes in both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely deny the bicameral concept,&quot; said Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be better not to change the regulation and vote according to the statute in force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agreement even if he believes that the regulation of elections set according to the Pelta advantage among all the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I want to vote according to the statutes of the association.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;For that there has not yet insane ideas dreamt up by a representative as during the past General Assemblies,&quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and which in its submissions is defined mostly against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him at Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The qualification possible today in a European Championship should calm everyone.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football on a wave of happiness and there will be more spirited for cooperation,&quot; the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the most experience leadership of both professional football at regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the regulations to design.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may cause a new blockage to the General Assembly.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope all good reason will win,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some meetings should be held directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the game. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The flight chartered in which to travel up to Podgorice between Vice other Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not taken off for technical reasons and was seeking a variant to take part of the executive committee on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties torn apart in the sports association the largest of the country and bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game, there are many: a state funding, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union Sports who should determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no candidate correct. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to what he calls for a new President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaigning for this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is such a candidate I support it, I fight for him and I do not go to the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,&quot; said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (CTK). </seg>
<seg id="552"> The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to the top of the AFRT which in principle would be favourite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik also points out that in case he would get the elections he would hold the post of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> He would see in an experienced manager and high level but who is not connected with the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I discussed with people who have the profile,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change this image,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> This, said - it bothers, especially Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of football of Plzen Roman Berbr, rights to the controversial reputation is known in the scenes as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates&apos; the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of Berbr, which is a shopkeeper, it would be even less favourable football,&quot; said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What angered still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been out there a few years during wiretaps in the investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any punishment. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what Pelta would bring prestige football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would be - we considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club Plzen.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case where Paclik would win the vote Thursday, it should prove he could cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has big abilities&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;It would be able to stand as head of the representation.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as manager of the Association it would not be able to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose in what I do not know,&quot; said Paclik, who in September has attracted much attention when he called for the annulment of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik says it would be at the level to lead the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I freinerais the influence of some interested groups who have for example tend to influence the Commission disciplinary and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; said Paclik who does not hide his dislike for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It also would consider a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power high-level policy would get for the sport more tax money on the games. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the key points which the new President should care.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their argument but they should also say where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not present his affair with the club Plzen as something negative even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;at the - above party.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not the ideal.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="582"> I see no reason to convey my shares of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to return after a year and a half, &quot;said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to situations of pat. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association a candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta said that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes should end the disputes in the future on the regulation for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official of Jablonec is before Thursday&apos;s meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success of the representation of football should calm this gué-guerre before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election of September which has not carried out promised to devote themselves to the national representation and financial resources if he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and the delay of two months may allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football, and the present in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels of football are long and expect Thursday there is a President.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association,&quot; he said, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, worked a great number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> it is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately to the General Assembly of June the statutes have been approved that were not perfect as all found out.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there had not all these interpretations we have already had a President since September,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is precisely the document review the most important of the civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I am President, I take that as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in cases where it does not work.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then he strives, said - it, not to confront its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said earlier that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl he acknowledges in his training in law and he knows that his opponent - candidate would be his first Vice-President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He has not attacked for long Tonas Paclik that instead of criticising Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It is in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were not the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;It is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; said Pelta to address his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the statements he made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level until the national representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a showcase of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I would endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with the Bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I immediately entering into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football,&quot; said the Czech news agency CTK reported the deadly candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also said that his appointment to the head of football would do no change people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should get acquainted with all employees,&quot; he said, where there is an understandable nervousness Strahov since there is no direction. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are catastrophic possible scenarios with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to the match.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and it will get that when there will be at its head a new leader,&quot; as Pelta says optimistically two days before the day probably decisive for his career official. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot;If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, however, that in the case where he would be elected we will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to systemic changes and make the Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He has also promised to settle the case Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make football more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President I want to get of football in its entirety.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;The international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation, of professional football and a successful football for youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I am not saying that I will do all this alone,&quot; Rajchl said in an interview for CTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I&apos;m a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is a specific area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will hand out difficult missions for football faced a great step forward.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people will not be happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticising others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> He did state, said - it, he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;At about me, you know that I work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;but I need to know if it is and if I have people behind me that I will constantly sticks in the wheels and issue doubts on each of my actions,&quot; explaining why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people have just said that I must not give up because they would also.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is a confidence that I can&apos;t betray,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates, said - it is to continue the work started with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Since these last two years there has been a great job and I don&apos;t want to let him down.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stopped.,&quot; he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic work and it is something that Mirek Pelta does not know.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are people who would of football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been selected.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;You can blame me a number of things but certainly not to support someone.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I am trying to be objective.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to make football for all, because everybody will be happy not only those who have been chosen </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms again that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are some who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum to Moravia.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian another whose winners would be in the first division.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;There would be no situation like now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is currently find young players. </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances to win. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I sense a permanent support of the Czech Chamber who elected me his Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successful,&quot; said Rajchl who plans among its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on contracts disadvantageous, contract negotiations with the television and on the law on the games. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> So he said about Pelta &quot;that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility,&quot; he thinks that the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate who has to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can doubt in Plzen it has done this year a superb job.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If elected, he would continue surely in what has been started by Hasek and make no significant change among the people in the Commissions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;It would not spoil its success,&quot; said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals. </seg>

<seg id="688"> The German bank abandons - her speculation on commodities? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE - Josef Ackermann instructed a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the leader of the group is then draw the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find unacceptable that banks are speculating on commodities like corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer group Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann said in this article that speculation on the commodity markets, pushing global prices and that banks share a complicity to global hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of consumer protection is specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, - even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> The speculation on commodities was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But the majority of experts share between - time that bettors have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann was responding to criticism differently US competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, &quot;no matter is worth put at stake the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch - Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of Deutsche Bank must be submitted - with recommendation, usual. </seg>
<seg id="703"> In January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> It could result in a reduction of the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann built its Image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time, confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian way, how the banks today are harmful to the general interest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which the money was invested on food speculation,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it is a question of starving people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The awareness of Ackermann may seem at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the chief executive of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the president of the Council of Administration will not change what is planned in the Council of Administration. </seg>
<seg id="712"> He could improve his image with an abandonment of agricultural speculation. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And about potential losses, it did little to concern - his successor will be. </seg>
<seg id="714"> A on two would terminate the investments in commodities. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far more than 30,000 people have already participated in the campaign organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has completed questionnaires from 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many customers of the bank would also personal consequences if they knew that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the poll, all the investments for which money is injected in speculation on commodities. </seg>

<seg id="721"> 21st home in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion who moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> On the Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for global exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 has won awards, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is again open and takes the place of house of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If there is enthusiasm for an architecture after - modern war, for his clear forms, its hangars in glass, and her bold and its new building materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Expo is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Schwanzer Pavilion received once the &quot;Grand Prize of Architecture&quot; for its construction, steel and glass and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is seen up to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He has made the architects so famous, he has also built the Pavilion for Expo next Austrian. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in the form of bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at international level in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the exhibition in the Garden Switzerland to the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened - </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was not physically or technically suitable for a museum - not walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However, it was also long used, &quot;so that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and is increasingly dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will be in future used as museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new departure was led by Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein - Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career in his youth, artistic skater in Sotheby&apos;s, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the museum of modern art of Salzburg, it led to the conversion work with politicians and the protection of monuments, it received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookstore there, and an office must be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Surveillance strict, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was &quot;extremely important&quot; a place where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> At the current changes, there were big problems: the building was &quot;a chasm in energy,&quot; said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of the facades in glass windows were changed, insulating glass fibre reinforced glass was asked and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The beams thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of light tamisé between home and road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but still the Schwanzer Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red, brown. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is identical to what it once was. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often materials that are good and inexpensive were to be found, and that appeal to the Office of the protection of monuments,&quot; said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a gross floor in basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, the problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> That would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot;which came from Brussels,&quot; said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of &quot;Drop - in - the - City.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture is &quot;still in the wrong place&quot; and wants to &quot;awaken the good conscience.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because there is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the &quot;area of the station&quot; newly planned, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the construction of another Krischanitz places, because the Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin-based temporary art center, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland. </seg>

<seg id="758"> The railway company has developed a plan - crisis, which aims to prevent the train accidents in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The number of employees will double. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn &quot;will spend more than 70 million this year. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The daily Bild Zeitung, reported earlier, citing a plan - internal crisis in the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015. </seg>
<seg id="763"> This should allow greater availability of vehicles and of the rail network in the case of extreme weather. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks should between other double and move to 16,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The goal is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of the devices necessary path in the service in a period of four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago the Chief station Ruediger Grube warned the government and the industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents also occurred this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter the railway company has been a lot of problems for the transport of users &quot;because it lacks between other reserves in case of difficult weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> That is how many new regional trains for years an authorisation from the Ministry of Railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there was a delay in the delivery of trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The company of railway has for years of what to do, given that it must check the axles of trains ICE significantly more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on a ICE in the central train station in Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German bank Deutsche Bank &quot;pays millions of penalties in the US. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the case of Josef Ackermann there is new to the USA: German bank Deutsche Bank &quot;must pay a fine to the tune of millions. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past catches up this giant of the sector in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pays compared 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It is the sale of mortgage documents. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The financial market regulator NCUA door to big banks a series of charges, and to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have played down the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led to the banks to the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to be able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiate a procedure in court,&quot; said a partner of Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank has recognised in comparison no fault. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible cooperative banks of the US and it comes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of customers. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="783"> The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator has also taken other major banks in part and he has been assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> As regards the issue of mortgage documents he is &quot;Mortgage - backed Securities.&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="789"> Even if the events are already a few years, at the moment it blows on US banks a wind storm. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and the supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain compensation or to punish breaches. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="792"> It accuses 18 major international banks, the two real estate financial state of US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be advantaged &quot;in nature in cases of mortgages of about 200 billion. </seg>
<seg id="793"> The Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, it is several operations to a total of 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>

<seg id="796"> WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billion IBM </seg>
<seg id="797"> Buffett, the guru of finance, invests huge sums into the company IBM IT. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Since March, he bought shares worth more than 10 billion. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Until - the big US investor Warren Buffett says constantly not investing in IT computer companies, given that the &quot;long-term evolution of companies do not suggest that bad outcomes. </seg>
<seg id="800"> It has, however, read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially services and computer systems to IT sectors of other companies. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment of Warren Buffett is considered an attack knighthood in the world of finance. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Therefore the IBM IT gives itself the right to appeal to &quot;Mr IBM.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="804"> For Buffett revealed today to the economic programme &quot;CNBC, he bought since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="805"> His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a big shareholder of IBM with 5.5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment. </seg>
<seg id="807"> He praised the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had assured of reasonable profits. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;You have done a great job,&quot; said Buffett strategically. </seg>
<seg id="809"> IBM set for some time on the lucrative services IT as &quot;exploitation of accounting centres. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years, offers both Software and consultation that calculators very efficient business. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett had until now refrained technology companies. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He said he invests only in businesses he understands business. </seg>
<seg id="813"> But the contrary Buffett tackles rather rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines. </seg>
<seg id="814"> His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole series of large groups such as Coca Cola - or Munich Re, the ex Rück. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The 80-year-old of 81 in the 1960s &quot;the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had erected in one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to smart investments. </seg>
<seg id="816"> However his lifestyle is modest. </seg>
<seg id="817"> That is why it is a cult figure for many investors the world over. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of Buffett&apos;s investment IBM shares rose one percent to the stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue&quot;, such as as IBM, also has a stock market value of a total of more than 220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> For Microsoft, said Buffett, it does not participate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is palpable </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickauer&quot; of the Turkish media are skeptical of the state of German law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper even talk of a &quot;bloody ideology,&quot; which return far. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had a context. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Following this new, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many germano-turcs the spectrum believed long dead reared its head: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this context right-wing extremist against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Whether there is a xenophobia in Germany, there has never been question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals the proportions which is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Is this a return to the bloody ideology,&quot; &quot;That was the title of the publication on the Internet in the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper Sabah &quot;underlines that one of the authors would have been a v - man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of extreme - right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is a reasoned that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the germano-turc recruitment. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with the gaies colours that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a history of success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The reports of some Turkish media are a slap: &quot;the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish platform, &quot;Haber X,&quot; which refers to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So the publication of German &quot;Hurriyet&quot; has no compunction to draw clear conditions. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;it starts to stink,&quot; is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He points out that people have been murdered, would have paid taxes and have given by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The police action was seen very critically on the germano-turcs forums and those - they had subsequently debated the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to search suspects in some circles of far-right, asking the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than a is ready at least rhetorical means drastic even: &quot;If the case continues to be, it will be to migrants anything other than self-defence and weapons.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;it will be the best self-defense.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,&quot; wrote &quot;Selen.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in Turkish and German memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a real threat, and the Germans, on what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> Once it is above all the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time, in his speech, how taxes produced the local Turkish population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media report shows once again how the distrust of many Germano-turcs is deep in the state of local law since that date. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of terrorism of extreme - right in Germany, a clear message is this time - if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal of Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS has done almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina between - time from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is a German who must lead now. </seg>
<seg id="859"> This is certainly not what Axel Weber&apos;s &quot;was imagined. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure of the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July that it would post in 2013 an almost as dramatic: President of the Council of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards a career unexpected and lucrative. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber has said publicly praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and was kind of comments on the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS managed the Turnaround.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything would change. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A securities dealer UBS in London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had soared about 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the board of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> President of the board of directors of UBS is seen since as suffering - and all are asking: When Axel Weber finally amount? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank statement Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber it becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, a professor of economy and President of the bank, and he was certainly need a period of adjustment. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which comes to prove yet again that she has long deserved the title of &quot;the biggest bank scandal of Europe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the biggest asset manager of the world, and the other, it is faltering for years of a scandal. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, the Swiss bank savings so proud. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss asset manager of strong, silent and cunning, but also, she had combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So the UBS managed to one side in 2007 with 1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the world&apos;s largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> That made sense. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of bank for long years in Zurich said: &quot;I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;In the current context, one wonders: how I could simply be wrong at this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It is profoundly wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something was amiss at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was regarded until - there as a senior and a brilliant intellectual banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later was tipped for what reasons he was party. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the bank had soared with Only documents and has done a cross on billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, have a role player furrowed her brow: Asian state not - transparent from Singapore and an Arab state, which was passed over in silence, to the point that there has never learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> &quot;This was the first time. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank was to announce fresh losses running into billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second board the better paid to Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was given its investment mistakes in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought at UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Any Switzerland has been rocked - because she noted how it can be dramatic for a small country, harboring if big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007&apos;s &quot;raised more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We have not been able to save the UBS again,&quot; said the researcher of banks, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster in the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months before, UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and is ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the IRS perhaps with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, it accepted a payment of 780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine together. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus the UBS has more or less published that she had helped to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board and the chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of clients&apos; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in both sectors of business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would do, he followed this unfortunate history of merchants of title: one merchant rocketing title 1.7 billion euros before the bank realization that something was amiss. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it publishes: with risk management in the investment bank that still does not seem to work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli, risk control to too little changed,&quot; said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German bank is safe: &quot;the problem of UBS is that it has no control of the risks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their function to become guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but safety for money - and the world could well collapse in the - beyond the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt &amp; amp; Spruengli chocolate are for a particularly noble. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The central UBS in Zurich will still hand in hand with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in the central train station of Zurich, which led directly to the central train station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are prestigious, rents stores are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The bijoutiers as Tiffany&apos;s, it is here between stores Swiss traditions like confectionery amp; Spruengli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries of Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse until private banks elitist as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It arrives in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are clad in stone, before are thick leather chairs, and the logo of the bank, a major label for &quot;safe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the client research here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank has a day off the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers it does business with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS would become too large, it is - - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are also common. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss there would have nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And even when they have long adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This has been the Anglo-Saxon investment bank UBS, which has changed, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime mortgage loans as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The crash of the UBS.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to 68 billion francs about 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankrupt the big bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially to the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have found a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank has been created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and constantly recorded an increase. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from UBS were completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the international investment banks have been favourably access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of Group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team,&quot; said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way up to the summit with the learning of the bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would have relied until &quot;at the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli would probably have committed to the end a decisive error: &quot;He thought that its models were the reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Disastrous, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The staff of the UBS remembers clearly rallies leaders during which the head of the group Wuffli gave always the same: to dethrone Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She has ordered the &quot;League Tables&quot; the rankings, which have documented at this time the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all the UBS wanted to climb to the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of currency and transactions in securities it has played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> The business advisors, who had the responsibility, have pointed out, however, a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the jargon &quot;Fixed Income,&quot; there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS would have shortcomings in the US mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, UBS has launched in an adventure, which almost cost him his life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Assoiffés growth, it is also the bank itself that a management created before it in the US sub-prime mortgage loans investments that have invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> She has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and put the documents of value based on US mortgages - but which has also retained risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks were looking for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> More euphoria is much more the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after another has had to leave, when put an end to attempts proved more difficult than we thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions at UBS became ejection and so far are bancaux. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Anyone who heads the big bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The bank researcher, Geiger has already an idea: an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the bank does not (yet) go so far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment bank must atrophying vigorously, as it is clear until now. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="966"> On Thursday the bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Italo-suisse 51 was only supposed to be transitional when the bank split with surprise of his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Between - time, it has emerged: it must conduct the affairs of UBS, said Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It reverses 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that &quot;Axel Weber has certainly already asked. </seg>
<seg id="976"> He said publicly until now only that he would seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>

<seg id="1013"> In many places, freux are considered &quot;problem of birds.&quot; But experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer hunt cities for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some, like the others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residents&apos; complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> A antidote against &quot;No problem of birds&quot; is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> In the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to drive the freux cities. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Experts from across Germany deliberated on possible solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They are looking for alternatives in cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> The protectors of nature based the problems of cities on the exodus of freux particularly protected: The use of chemicals in agriculture to destroy more of the traditional vital spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Hunting, development and the slaughter of nesting trees typical made life difficult for birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The crows are under the protection of nature. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large settlements with more than 600 nesting couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the north west - including Jever, and Achim Diepholz near Bremen and in Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region. </seg>

<seg id="1026"> The destruction of nests using the water under pressure or cut down trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals moving away, large colonies split up and they disperse in other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> &quot;The elimination is conceivable that in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We are forced to live with them, we cannot be exterminated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Concevable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif conditioning and tempting offers to help resettle elsewhere. </seg>

<seg id="1033"> Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger - road - educational dimensions of the Schleswig Holstein -, road signs advising on the lives of these freux very intelligent. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This project was between - time adopted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical of the noise caused by birds: &quot;This is a large number of communication, these birds - there have much to say.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The freux are not only work instruments to achieve a treat but they make their own tools as instruments of work. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The éthologistes of Cambridge University tested four freux recently, at what point is the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to do down scaffolding with stones in order to achieve a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much training, they recognized that a déterminément stone should have some size and form to collapse the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second trial, the astute crows then had to solve a problem more compact. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a cylinder placed vertically, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The birds could not reach their spoils with their spat. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers had set pieces of wire at their disposal. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals formed a hook with which they fished the small bucket of small pipe. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four freux manage even from the start. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War&quot; (Beauty and the Sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters who you greenhouse the heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> A council to start: déchirez carefully this page and into your marque-page. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will learn to know these people in detail. In this storybook tale of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in these few moments where, as one of its men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He wrote a book out of the ordinary that he described, accurately, as &quot;a book of anti-histoire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains a few names, treaties important or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on the strategies and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not a book about what happened, he said, &quot;a book describing what it could look like.&quot;. It is the &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and grief&quot; summarizes the experiences in time of war 20 men and women more or less ordinary, the two sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, passing by doctors, paramedics and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become mad or lose life. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives are vacillating here as a church candles: while some extinguishing rightwinger, new. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It has the idea that the First World War is that by the terrible war trenches on the Western Front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and grief&quot; described deftly other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies boisterous are a problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving from the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina which stinks the cordite still hanging. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When cannon shots echoed in the distance, and you&apos;re a stay-at-home mom, are you staying or fuyez-vous? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who will come anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, &quot;the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and grief&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a sailor of the German fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most address the deprivation and the ability to get by. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;Ersatz, ersatz everywhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Café, fake imitation of aluminum, rubber, paper, bandages wooden buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He continued on the replacement food in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He described the &quot;meat made of crushed rice cooked in fat mutton (and over with a false bone of wood); tobacco manufactured with roots dry and the dried skin of potatoes; wooden soles of shoes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> He says that &quot;837 permitted substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. It also find 511 cafes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories deal with honour and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own impulse to the savagery and says about the war: &quot;You feel that, after all, is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier realizes he may die, and that nobody will notice or pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> It is unfortunately rather comparable to &quot;a man strangled in secret.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other comments relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict becomes more of a history of economic competition,&quot; said Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It captures the arrival of what he called &quot;a new species within the aviary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-balanced and convinced ideologically, clothes well tailored, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People act unexpectedly behaviour; there is so much that heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried to catch a vénérienne disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;It is the most grotesque in the trade of more due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers&quot; buy and cover the genitalia in the hope of finishing in the hospital, &quot;he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves prose, Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to its task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has &quot;triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are beginning to ask why their leaders are a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books on the First World War are often indirect, as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (The Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or &quot;In the west nothing new,&quot; Erich Maria Note, rather than complete. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The book by Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictionnelle. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do not reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if it had come out of his book, seized your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a match. </seg>

<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said that many people would and came in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. An hour of the morning was therefore a schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to proceed when the park was the least of people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The emergency services vehicles equipped with commercials and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and loudspeakers resounding recorded messages appeared to intimidate protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While the Community affairs officers entered the park equipped their clear blue jackets, many protesters have simply gathered their business and are parties. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said the Police, which left the occupants to gather their business. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Police Department, said that the measure had been taken solely by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But after many journalists, the Police would have prevented the speech inside the park, seriously held by officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the Police was moving west through the dense thicket of cases of demonstrators, including luggage, the grass in sheets and plastic bags filled with clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning all the occupants left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp clung together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The emergency services were called to cut the lock. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests took place in the park before 0330 Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to the Police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> most for &quot;disturbing public order and rebellion.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to be found on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the Department detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr Kelly, although now, &quot;did not operations&quot; Mr. Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of police officers filled along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention needed. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> The barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It was the Police extend well beyond the perimeter of the park Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen push people away. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Nearly 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the most serious of the night took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> At around 5.00, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the overturned a police car. Others have been sighted in the process of clearing the tires of a truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen in the wheel of the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union of school aid is suing the city for redundancies </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to bring a trial in the city for layoffs unnecessary and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionate on schools serving disadvantaged pupils. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the Council of the 37th District, to try to overturn the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred seventy-two school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the less well paid, City have lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have helped close the budget gap last spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The municipal authorities have denied the charge. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Council responded, mentioning that layoffs of school aid n &quot;were not specified in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they meet a notice of claim, warning the education department that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of the education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black or Latin American origin, as most school aid that have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft of complaints received by the New York Times, the union backing the number of redundancies in schools in the most deprived areas of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to underfunding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and some barely in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts neighborhoods south of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the prosecution say &quot;This is not a neighborhood of well-off parents who can get funds to fill the gap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the &quot;public school 36 has been reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the entry of additional funding for each pupil.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also says that the directors of schools have been misled by some terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo employed the term &quot;overshooting&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;excess&quot; described more generally the action of moving a teacher of a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> According to the project of complaints, &quot;66 parent coordinators were laid off,&quot; and &quot;not only for cause.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed: Congress to find agreement on the issue of Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It would appear that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as U.S. involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Sens. John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), clapping the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of U.S. operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The U.S. mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory legislature - the Congress sufficiently upset to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough for him out of the sails. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecisiveness of Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed last October 20. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations &quot;congratulate the Libyan people for his extraordinary courage and determination for freedom&quot; and &quot;congratulate the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and great professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also says &quot;the national interest of the United States to reach a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The EU &apos;s new measure all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or divisera-t-elle lawmakers like last June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Sen. and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The amendment is part of the 68 Goodlatte constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress on a broad range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions in the House only the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who &quot;would control federal spending.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being &quot;author&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August asked the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of warrants during which members of Congress can serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is proposed, like the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So eager were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, lawmakers have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slows in the early 1990s, when the members were generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Massacrée but not beaten&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman was shot at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) emerged Monday night in a television broadcast, sang &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow Broadway&quot; and said he would before any recover rather than return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> During his appearance at the newspaper &quot;20 / 20&quot; on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled for form phrases and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> &quot;The show has touched his return difficult following the ball that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery &quot;difficult.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied &quot;rather well.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of &quot;20 / 20,&quot; broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple&apos;s new book entitled &quot;Gabby&quot;: a story of courage and hope. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The &quot;special issue has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, we see on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It is to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A sign of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A movement of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, his first word: &quot;Be.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) to ask to change the menu of his breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see Representative singing with doctors air Cyndi Lauper&apos;s &quot;Girls Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty &quot;Free Fallin &apos;?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, it was him read an article on the shooting of 12 March when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;There was a lot of people,&quot; said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Dur, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said &quot;I was beaten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I would say, &apos;Gabby&quot;, you have not been beaten, &quot;said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And turns out, to restore and come back stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More pity that respect for the troops. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala at Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans of New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ride on the powerlessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The Supporters crowd is standing on its feet cheering for the. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women, are considered heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A military haut-gradé, attended the gala also Adm. Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They have been presented as a kind of orphan,&quot; haut-gradé wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organisers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But this was not the respect. Just pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have installed between the military and an American public passionate but often distant. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> There are lavished praise the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say some military. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all,&quot; said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of spirits unlucky.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> It is a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who do not want to seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the anger of revenantes troops of the Vietnam War was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most conversations on the mercy in confidence among the veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some people would watch with respect because they were facing insurgents and have traveled to distant lands. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others will ask if &quot;a veteran angry and violent hiding under the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government to Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were the subtle way talks asked if he would be able to cope under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you raise the subject of the service, you are facing negative impressions,&quot; said Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military difficulties arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The victories are rarely congratulated by a country as unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, we value more heroism in the same way as the Second World War,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of the military. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized for the number of periods of services endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of the injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army face growing pressure to crack down on rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a hearing will decide whether capital 28 men and women will go on trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> The case, hundreds of plaintiffs prepare the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008. She was returning to his barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a six-pack of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join in his bedroom for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;C&quot; was a wake-up call, &quot;said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texane has set aside his concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, it has 19 years. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is the Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I will have to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after entering the bedroom Elizabeth Lyman, the man was grabbed from behind, thrown by land and raped, claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and not others, will wait with anxiety the court decision during a historic trial which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> They are accused of not having stopped the widespread rape within the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved the departure 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke says in galonnées military, because the problem starts by them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals in a position to&quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> The lawyer also said that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future lawsuits. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: instead bring all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all its eggs in one basket - it will start several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team, for the Defense Department, led by the US attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defence, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged evil is inherent to military service of the complainants&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Department declined to comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is listed on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are only rarely. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with the local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernise says Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> It is not only to fight: three other trials are underway in more of its own. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At the Yale law school, the center of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynistic. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorders&quot; awarded to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women&apos;s Action Network (network of military action), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group has filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of applications for benefits for people who have been victims of sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine bills independent of each other have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded after the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, after the Pentagon&apos;s own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents this year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report appeared in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she says, asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape at different police, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She suffered a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, a trial in which we asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was delivered,&quot; said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to start having contractions. I am crying after the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I have been placed in psychiatric unit, and when I&apos;m out, I remember saying to my commander&quot; This was not his trial but mine. &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who finished by diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she has been referred under the terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Is that the case Lyman and other plaintiffs argue or not, it is a long history, says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, it noted, &quot;In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticised the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they are trying,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things change only when the good have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring its hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as there will be no reform.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where &quot;so that we would, one or other of the two options. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: researchers studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe&apos;s Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy doing his anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who said he was taken to a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik acted alone, it was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the far-right groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy... Connectez-vous to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that it was not so difficult that it to find them,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report released recently by the think-tank on digital DEMOS populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site&apos;s advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way the mercaticiens do for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans far-right groups in Europe. It has targeted with the ads, but instead to link it to a new group or product announcements, inviting users to respond to an inquiry. The questions related to their education level, their attitudes to the violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> In coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;This is a new way of doing research,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some results are not surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &quot;those that combine online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The &quot;study of DEMOS is only an example on how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> The groups of reflection, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the &quot;I love,&quot; publications on the walls and updated statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add content on average three per day, &quot;the supernova data&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not get in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you try to carry out investigations on the people of the British National party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You have to go to the party, but you would never have allowed to enter,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and deal with the social and health problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook their exploits drunk were much more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet about it. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can&apos;t deal with a problem if you don&apos;t has diagnosed,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, behavior and the development of children in the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and which are not recognized in another case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly access to information of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The team of the site which handles data has studied the statistics on the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (information only available - champions digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its trove of data to others for research purposes). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the site notes, that they like it or not - in exchange for power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres, the site is allowed to access your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation which they have not even heard? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have clearly defined instructions on how to collect the information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory Knowledge of London, according to a 2006 study he conducted in observing the Facebook walls of its students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know the truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools we can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;The social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, this is not in front of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Froid and inhumane&quot;: first appearance of&apos;s Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> &apos;s Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter &quot;resistance&quot; during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Templiers of Norway,&quot; he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;As regards the jurisdiction of the court, I recused, because you want your mandate of organisations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he &quot;did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who has brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The judge Nesheim has also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody 12 more weeks, has forbidden him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came hoping to watch Breivik in the eyes, to be sure he would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I found cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya Norwegian television channel NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;&quot; I was not comfortable, but I personally a little advanced after having seen and heard the suspect. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes in entering and leaving the court. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the odd idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of &quot;resistance,&quot; the judge determined he was not crazy. He also said there was no evidence that it has acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The attacks of July 22, seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which - absolutely not perhaps some. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview lost Steve Jobs, film this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - qualified by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what Apple fans can find more telling in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how the creative spirit had understood the process and work flow products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a améliorateur of rolls - a man who believed that many business leaders had a &quot;disease their suggesting that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a clever idea of a product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds.&quot;. This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly rebound, is the basis of the film 68 minutes entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known to hate the detailed interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technological and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> We also find times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where it seems eager to hear the issues of Cringely, giving him shots for the elbow to speed up and move to questions or issues of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Shot before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something eerily prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and its own vision on the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of crude and inspiring on the man we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He explained then put away. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here is a summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the way he has learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During all these years, I have always asked: &apos;Why are you doing things?&quot; and the answers are always the same:&apos; Oh, simply because it must do. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why, no one is looking at things in a company. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs is giving details on its efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> my astonishment about how the costs were registered - often begins with a &quot;standard&quot; valued at cost to nose, then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; - he has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the opportunity to play a round the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that he founded with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack the phone networks and free telephone longue-distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device has been the subject of many written beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He described how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone call and then, in a AT&amp;T network to another while bypassing satellite as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public phone and you arrived a minute later the public phone in hand,&quot; says Jobs joked. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and thanks to the Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We do not know much, but we have created a small thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without this one day. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue box in the middle of the night in posing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the US diplomat, the two accomplices are crazy laugh just before the Pope himself is awake. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On his love with technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, the hunt for spare parts to build a fréquencemètre, the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and is a blow over. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This has been a remarkable influence on me. It&quot; was the only company that I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs is subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he found the &quot;first desktop computer ever designed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The teenager that I &quot;was returned in HP and began to write programs for this machine. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvisation of innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to address the assembly and the delivery of the aircraft finished. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember big wrangling... I cried over claiming that it would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I have had enough, I came out and went to see a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and who proved incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On the big companies that have stalled: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Even before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;If you work for IBM or Xerox, you made a better or a better printer, copier and after?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can change, so [these types of people] that eventually lead businesses and staff specializing in product are put on the &quot;gap of decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can&apos;t imagine design a good product versus a bad product - the manual work required. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold all the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They snatched defeat to victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A huge part of manual work between a clever idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot on its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are compromises to do... Some things you can&apos;t do, the electrons can, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) in assembling to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. It is trying to give you the best products that men have created, and try to bring these things to the product you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have always ashamed to steal good ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> That is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have simply been the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If not for the computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dînent with opponents of health law while the court convenes </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama&apos;s health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was last Thursday, when the nine justices gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5 is expected in March, and the result will be likely to promote the destabilisation of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming when the court&apos;s decision will be made. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who argued before the court and on the rejection of the law, will be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The legal firm Clement of Bancroft PLLC, was part of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Fédéraliste), a group of dedicated to defend the longtime conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> If there was, among other top Republican, Mitch McConnell, the Senate and opponent of the health care bill. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The star guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present to the events of the Fédéraliste Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there was nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they probably by the TSE Code of Canon 4C, which states: &quot;A judge can attend fundraising organizations related to the right and although the judge could not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two law firms of the case, as well as a business with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethical government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respect the same rules apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges drank and ate and a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event to dismantle any claim to impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the critics saying that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife, Ginni Thomas, is a conservative activist haut-profil. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, the Tories claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been brought in the court of first instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have been pressing for Kagan has recused to hear the case, saying it was too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan gave no indication that it would. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing has a record of 18 billion dollars for planes </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners, bisexual - corridors, with the option to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There was nothing extraordinary in what a company gets an order contemplating 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> It is a case when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had reached the record $18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally incredible is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine of future aircraft orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 planes worth a total of 450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the order of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi - corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this gargantuan order. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Show 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to 26 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model who prides himself significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six aircraft&apos;s &quot;amounts to more than a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;These customers in particular have a huge value.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In the Middle East oil producing countries have a lot of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> They have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their costs the most - would not be so damaging as the country would gain money with oil prices rising. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the oil price increases, Dihora reported. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural risk coverage,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing on the market for wide-bodied aircraft and help to curb the attempt of encroachment of competitor Airbus with its A350 plane. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing at air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777 - 300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus pushes its debut in order to increase the surge following its customers to increase its holding capacity and autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Shares of Boeing rose 1.5 percent to reach 67,94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The Mexican president&apos;s sister clearly the Michoacán elections </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost his attempt to access to the functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and it said Monday that drug traffickers have favoured one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They snatched ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have forced people to vote for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until &quot;to lose the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to be stood out little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, candidate of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the presidential election of 2012 for this left divided and unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles has also refused to recognise the results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any link with drug traffickers and has urged other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Still, violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before elections a mayor of the NAP was assassinated as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have given up locally to the campaign by fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, for the PRI as corrupt, that the elections of Michoacán have the air, a victory will help the party in its tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The BASD urges Asia to help the euro zone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, director general of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth of the world should &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to speed up the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He was advised not to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a &quot;indifferent eye&quot; and reported that a financial support to Asian leaders and resources of Europe would help to avoid a collapse in the long term the &quot;global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected until&quot; at some point but it is not immune. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that nothing in it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has stirred up fear that the global economy is in recession, and prompted the appeal of the main emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag has hypothesised that the IMF would bring Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - as buying bonds from the financial bailout fund of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater power of negotiations to Asian partners of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade and Industry, said that &quot;India will do everything it can&quot; to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of arrivals of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the euro area remains volatile and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;This is not a choice, it is imperative, because where trouverions-nous work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich when they face their own economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800 000 live on $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;One day, they discover that Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will struggle to swallow,&quot; he reported. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, has also asked why the reserves of India should be used to maintain many Greek officials paid well in poorly managed that generate losses, as in the rail sector. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause &quot;significant impact&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The forecast of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia in 2011 / 2012 now face &quot;the risk of loss&quot; because of the threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He pointed out that emerging markets vulnerable needed to develop &quot;backup plans&quot; to protect an economic downturn and significant leaks of capital. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Sévères warnings from the Pentagon on the potential cuts to the defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, has upped the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It sparked a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, from gatherings of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already digesting some 450 billion of cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget deal resulting in what we call sequestration would, 23% reductions and the freeze of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A reduction as important, applied indiscriminately and make the most of our vessels and construction projects unfeasible - you can&apos;t buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm the other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes undermine the faith of those who support our military and our preparation would seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts would affect possibly combat troops, continues Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the funding in time of war accounts contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis,&quot; said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contract who support the war.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff manager salaries would be reduced, leading to delays of payment to the suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping on the Defense Department would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as undisputed world leader of military power.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday after - noon at the publication of the letter to Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a result with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> What the letter to Panetta and recent warnings of senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even if it is reached itself at the top Pentagon post with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a news conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a bleak picture of what could happen - one with a shell but no core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;This is a ship without sailors.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;This is a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;This is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs which did not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force depressed, ill-prepared and unable to confront potential adversaries.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, it invites aggression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined specifically how further cuts could &quot;generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in combat operations future.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber expected, the marine - new generation missile, the new combat ship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee army and navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step of improvement and response to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to spot a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at recent headlines suggests how the deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The directors of Penn State have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach to retire has sexually abused boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie destroyed careers and convulsé countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The member of Congress from New York and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted by evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign financing related to coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, no one who has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The stories of cheating to the school and university are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers gave students test answers to do on their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How deception meet - we? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On any given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of those - these are lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners to lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to said: &quot;I have had,&quot; the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the old myths on lies were démystifiés. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars look at you in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They bégayent, blush or are not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years to review scientific results in the vast body of knowledge and always emerge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars are adept at reading others, putting them at ease in managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the introvert, the men say more focused on them &quot;lies&quot; while women say more lies &quot;focused on the other&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as an infidel, others will feel less guilty of you lie. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, look at the normal behaviour of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> That is what we call &quot;establish benchmarks.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps to provide a benchmark to measure future changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Look at the posture of your subject, laughter, the voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You have to know if someone is moving normally his feet continuously in order not to make accusations unfair when you see stir the feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then looking for clues of deceptive behaviour verbal and non-verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The misleading people can stop the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, looking towards an exit, change of posture significantly or present a post-interview &quot;relief&quot; - a sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues are. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is completed just to seek to trigger the reaction post-interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Therefore, made the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson has slid using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search to find her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The individuals misleading language can also use a beat: &quot;I have not had sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat entirely a difficult issue. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a lot of &quot;language of wood&quot; during his response to a difficult question: &quot;Well... to tell the truth... if I remember assets... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by scammers in their professional and personal life. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - prompting the ire of unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said it is ready to redirect the project to the back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said Monday that it will move the proposed pipeline outside the area ecologically sensitive dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Capitol Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision granting a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real way forward,&quot; said Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department probably would have delayed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and he expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 2,735 km pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> He carry 700,000 barrels per day since the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do this, it would have to cross six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, which have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan are pushing a law to force the remoteness of the area of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact study in the State Department found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered a separate investigation of the review process focused on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomit fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a spate of violence in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, has horrified their small daughter to the point where she has vomited fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer has frightened the small Genevieve Monk aged 18 months, so that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;the heightened fear of foreigners,&quot; said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year while the stage technician Kevin Monk, his preschool teacher wife, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to travel as a family. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk would seek the car, Roseanna Monk snaked down in the lobby of their building Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Genevieve in his arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said she was arrested near the door and had asked his daughter for a time. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone came behind me and said:&quot; Do you know what your daughter? &quot;I said&quot; yes &quot;and I went out,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle has angrily berated the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;She told me of an aggressive tone:&quot; You shouldn&apos;t let your daughter near the door, &quot;said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I replied:&quot; what you say or think. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became aggressive and began to use swear - the word &quot;and the word&quot; a strong voice... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water and began to spray water bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to this woman:&quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &quot;said the mother of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was still in his arm Genevieve - and had to be restrained by his entourage has caused to a car, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family has sent a note demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint asks for unspecified damages, but the family&apos;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he has made the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money received at a cancer charity for children. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The goal is to take Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,&quot; Davis said. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially against a kindergarten teacher wearing a child of 18 months.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> The climate adversity slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez Sinaloa, unemployment and the informalité have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of the change, which has generated great expectations in relation to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity the beginning of the year, the increase is not, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The temperatures of February from losses of trillions to the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state&apos;s economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31,16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of assignments by the frozen issued by the Mexican Council Rurale Development Soutenable, there has been damage to 582 million hectares cultivated 835, including a 78,03 percent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21,07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops have been vegetables, corn and peas stingy. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state&apos;s unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rise accelerated, because during the January to March 55 000 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent Population Economics Active, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and the July to September the average has continued to raise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 000 sinaloens unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 000 969 people. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The Sinaloa unemployment during the year is multifactoriel, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly on the actions carried out by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we see is a rise in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars an illegal way is not easy as they work for the win, they use and invest in something,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration held </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes reported that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because as they have already struggling to find work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, unemployment,&quot; said déclaré-t-il. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Lack of serious </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the labour market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, the 60,38 percent of the working population in this state is working without pay as worker with no social insurance institution. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In part of unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the discrepancy are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly earnings of workers sinaloens was, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> As part of the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 we recorded the biggest reduction of Foreign Direct Investment last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the IED the state has reached 630 697 thousand dollars, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 143 000 312 5 million dollars registered in the same period the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies of the service sector. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July at the congress public approval of a credit of $3 trillion pesos, intended to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the Congress of the State has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there was no benefit in any sector of the economy of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> For the representatives of the sector employers, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation, said that in 2011 there was not a harmonisation of the wishes of the various sectors - included, the Government of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, we must work hard to recover the ground we have lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, he took up the effort of all and especially the synchronized already this new team of Government, hope that next year is much better,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Economic Sluggishness </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López said that events like the frozen the beginning of the year have held the state&apos;s economy and restricted his performance and growth. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The low economic fluxe is product of several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which is fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level e flow in the trial, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close to - much below the expectations we had,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Redefine the vocation </seg>
<seg id="1891"> For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronale Confederation of the Sinaloa Mexican Republic said that it wants to harness the state towards productive activities more dynamism. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In general terms we have observed that we worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme which redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential out material and human resources of Sinaloa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Many to do </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future which channels the best efforts of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development a few advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programma,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way of management of public policy. </seg>

<seg id="1904"> The financial obligations towards the contributions to the books </seg>
<seg id="1905"> The works of contemplés in social programs like Hábitat, Públicos and 3x1 Rescate of Espacios para migrants may not be finished recording where serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The director of Municipal Social Development said that although so far the construction programs have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the Government of the state has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programmes. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> It reported that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> &quot;They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon finish they have given nothing, even if since July they should give us a party,&quot; he says, &quot;and we, for not registering delays, we started the works and we have a lot of progress, but we need the money.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided this opportunity - there. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;We had already suffered in the previous sexennal period because the State did not have the economic ability to participate and programmes continue to function and this year we, to have access to these programs, we get the resources to cover what the state had not paid,&quot; détailla-t-il. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management for the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> &quot;They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given nothing.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The Court valid &quot;analogue switch-off in 2015&quot; in Mexico </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The substitution of analogue know her by the exchange is a more important that the world has suffered the last few years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies made against the presidential decree which advance the so-called &quot;analog&quot; cut 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers - included, the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or not - constitutionality of decree, and this continues to be in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft sentence, developed by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the decree as not - constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of command and subordination of law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favour of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and admitting complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all actions planned by it for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary session of ministers resolved an attempt by the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive may not structure through general standards the measures for the public administration is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I believe that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has for constitutional mandate the leadership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitution of analogue know by digital know is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years and this is reflected in a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, signal a better quality and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Ajourner change, he argued, would be that the benefits of the digitisation that involves a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, &quot;because it also includes economic issues, social, political and national security.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These questions, he said, &quot;require the operation of a system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants the faculty of the Executive of the State&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> He recalled that a large number of countries across the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done through the Executive, despite the fact that they had strong technical bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> We cannot conclude that the Commission, in issuing the decree, has invaded a form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere respect laws issued by the Législative, assura-t-il. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> The analysis of the possibility of a &quot;vote by vote count&quot; in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 trial - verbal totals. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of the count &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Préliminaires Électoraux Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 trial - verbal totals. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (EIM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonise standards to the federal reform. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> It is recalled that Michoacán has not licensed nor its Constitution Policy or his or her State Electoral Code Act, Justice Électorale, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms that will shortly before the legal time limit for that electoral trial can enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in the deadlines set by the Act of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Législative Power and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reform, because it has no right to &quot;sanction or challenge.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed on the possibility of &quot;vote by vote,&quot; María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of EIM it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counting of votes by the local electoral body. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Thus, the partial tally of votes, or several electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the trial - coincide verbal; there was no trial - of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not among the president; or there are obvious errors or defects trial - verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Moreover, the total count of votes received in all polls of the election will be done when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the candidate supposed respective winner of the election and which won second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is express a petition of the representative of the party and / or coalition who presented the second candidates reported. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total count can also be achieved if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the candidate assumed winner and second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the petition specific political party whose candidate came second, cases in which we exclude electoral packages that have been subject of the partial tally. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 trial - verbal totals. </seg>

<seg id="1980"> It is expected that it presents a cabinet in his majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said he would present the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European Commissioner reporters. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti has not said explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> &quot;The framework is now well mapped out,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time more reduced that normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to support. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In adding pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of markets to put the performance of 10-year BTP Italian bonds by - above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers&apos; federation Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: &quot;We said that we would support the government.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy kind of this emergency situation. </seg>

<seg id="2047"> Is it adds a little pressure to your visit. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the biggest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>

<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe that this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each love songs different, so it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the pool that we have not seen for a very long time, that helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and we can have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That fact that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people. </seg>

<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and to continue to make music together we émotionne a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to go to places of the world that we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could get better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> That means for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is very common. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a group comes to a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We are playing with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we have seen in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of his of Seattle that arises. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a group like the your remains united and with the same members for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined 13 years ago, and only it is much more time than many groups normally last. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the first place, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive, and second, we are all concerned for the other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all friends and through this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We have confidence in each other with the music and it could only get better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you could do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall in this game of big numbers and people who like your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not forget that it must respect the music and what has made, set in mind the fact that there is famous and a rock star, which is not really any of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we&apos;ve written good songs and the beginning this was awesome. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a group for almost three years and we have not released a new album before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There was a lot of frustrations for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it was making me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. </seg>

<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and that - there was the group that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer direct and this must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> What you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It is he who sings and I believe it does with the first words he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, what are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are both... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first I remember there was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone Place, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, that I could talk all the after noon on the Baathists - that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How managed Pearl Jam has maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think, it reminds me of the groups that I mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if it is in now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth the trouble to listen and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What should this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, as The End gold Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if those - it can sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With the two, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened to and those - these are songs deeply obscure. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think if you grow up and there was a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things are starting to influence your art and your music and songs, without doubt, is it for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that we can also be happy and even as it can make music. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Parc or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide on the opportunity of the convening the - beyond the controversy over the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> By the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the already extinct - Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as the biggest park in the metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York&apos;s Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the higher limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one who is not heading on the axis north – south, if not high (low) - (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was not Central Park or Yellowstone, with boar in the role of the bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega - competition composed by 16 competition for all the doors of access to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door to the idea of park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> That is, or someone wants to put doors on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both in terms of its organisation as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme, including two former members of that caste elected to speak when they recognize in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this is just one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after the coastal front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot; because the speech Ildefons Cerda, green blocks has not been led to end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It must start from the basis that the park more extended Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;gave the verdict the architect for which the title of&quot; Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap &quot;lexicon: we must think about those - it&quot; as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas in which it must act. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some peril.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> There are perils of &quot;the uncertainty of projecting public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s and has been in the area of the Forum, &quot;his swan song.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limiting something means making the next step,&quot; i.e., the excess. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We must think about new instruments, urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can cause genuine disasters.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> By taking over the issue, Modol said that, by simplifying the side of the region El Valles de Collserola &quot;can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola which &quot;must not be lost,&quot; thanking the city for the opportunity to offer his corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first time.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Moreover, he meant that the proximity of the mountain with the city is - except that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; whether this looming technique must lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success,&quot; he says) that it is creating: &quot;We, the architects, should only be an instrument.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the bases of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;It was summoned 16 horizontal competition - he says - in the sense mountain - sea, but there was not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the area as a whole.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This fact, at least in this case, he has opted to participate in the 16 competition. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In a different way, a project for a doors can shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the door. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda of Dalt should, in all its extension, an area of equipment that performs a gentle transition between the city and green. </seg>

<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the secretary said a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even last a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Services Auxiliaires said that the moment of impact, the helicopter to the Presidential Major worked in speed of cruiser and this happened on a bottom-up soft ground. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information supports the hypothesis of a normal functioning cruiser at the time of the impact,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> During the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Flight visually: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the aviation standards, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions at takeoff, and the aircraft has progressed to the boundary zone between City and the state of Mexico there were layers of low cloud cover. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Routes selected: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that &quot;because of the conditions of cloud cover the crew has sought a height lower and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The details of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss of control or alteration of the trajectory of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in an area reduced: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a trajectory right lateral and. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was hit on the ground in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The was not detected traces of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the place of the sinister there was still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the work of ground was found pieces of the aircraft at a height of 9 000 200 feet - above the average level of the sea, the soil had a slope that goes for seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which he is possibly thrown out of joint throughout his journey. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the soil. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful research in an area further that the place surrounded, around the accident, it has not found disperses parts of the aircraft, which bears the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social Insurance heads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; this is borne by the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced he leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called yet protocol of obesity in children and adolescents who will have the markers associated with being overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the Unit for Investigation Médicale in Biochimie of the Hospital of Spécialités Medical Centre National of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social attend. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of third round of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In the investigation are invited to participate the population having or not right, to run in the IMSS sports units participating in Valle of Mexico City, where is the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the protocol has started in the Cuauhtémoc Medicine Unit (Estado de Mexico City Poniente) and from 8 October, the activity is taking place in the Medicine Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de Mexico City Oriente). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After reaching the goal of getting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Medicine Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Medicine Unit (north of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and that e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and Mexican youth risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As we celebrate the 14 November the World Day of the Diabètes, he mentioned that the objective is to meet three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires relating to food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family history of heredity diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger health conditions like diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He detailed that Saturdays we will apply to all participants of anthropométriques measurements (weight, height, circumference of the size), determination of blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin (the genetic and seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals to the alarming weight in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;The health investigations of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been a rise in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in regard to overweight there has been a dramatic increase, pointed out the IMSS specialist. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He said that the justification for the search markers is based in the fact that the country&apos;s population is different from other genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He informed that, on average, have a Mexican 65 percent of heredity US-India, a 30 percent and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people with diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to burn excess that consumes energy (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher said that the direct benefit for participants is the full valuation of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> He even said that the presence of the folds of dark colour (acanthosis) on the neck and arm before - indicate the probability of developing metabolic changes and even meadow - diabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is managed in a way, the doctors call by writing to parents, which explain each of the measures and changes in the style of life that they must do to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: the physical inactivity, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going off on short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another issue is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - block of meat to maize flour wrapped in sheets of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic analysis in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The asphalt of UNAM would avoid blackcurrants </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a researcher from the Faculty of UNAM, equaled the development of asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the know that the streets were resolved, it would not be necessary to fix about 200 000 blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of Mexico City, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of the paved sands is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During its conference A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater resistance, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera said that this type of asphaltes modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance and, therefore, the training of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a higher molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give the paved his characteristic viscoélastique behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoélastique behavior of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt is slashing, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad in Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three imply the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones drenched in asphalt and packed later. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each small stones that form the layer, he warned, is bathed year asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When the vehicles spend generating efforts, it allows that the forces spread very well in the streets. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If we had the asphalt amended, those - it will be better, opinât the ingénier chemical. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the layer of asphalt, he says, is a last layer called layer of turnover, made in stone, i.e., sand that is also bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide grip in the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires it to have a proper thickness and the material it is made must be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he says, because those - they affect significantly the performance of the layer of asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground is, the water spreads inside the layer is that it is difficult, which ramollie all sections of the streets and therefore cause of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the trial of training a blackcurrants, he says, the first which is spoiling the film and only later turnover is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury did not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the National System Chercheurs explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the stone must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the formation of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there was still much to investigate and work on the asphalt emulsions, for example, the bitumineuses, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What has failed to the candidate of Valle to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives his title No. 14 of Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time - and Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium winners, wear the crown of money and the band that accredits as new Princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is rising with the crown and sceptre, the Department sum already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is a to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who are found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many of the world is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What he missed? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who have won the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first key factor in the decision taken by the sworn to designate First Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with his answer to the question &quot;? What was the book that marked and why? by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the response of candidate of Valle to this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is&quot; The Little Prince, &quot;is a book deep enough. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &quot;Crime and Châtiment,&quot; this is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called &quot;The fervor of the blood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response has not rained firstly because of the term &quot;culturaliser&quot; and secondly not to explain specifically how every book quoted had marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result &quot;the universe and wise, it happens what must happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the world, please read a little, &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; is a great book &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by the patronage. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A reporter of Bogota has insinuated that being the favourite, and announcing the candidate who received all the preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;it has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the stage.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it noted that in his first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and two parades the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even if the two parades she had appeared self-confident, we noted that she had not the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme &quot;Como in casa&quot; (As at home), the Canal NCR said that the fact that Melina was named Princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the National Beauty Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a committed woman in regard to the social needs of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia - need to look beyond the physical and focus on his social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects,&quot; expliqua-t-elle. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> One speculates that Valle has sinned by its flaws of his behind fibrosis and who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate &apos;natural Beauty&apos; with the body more healthy, good diet and physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina had not the best body, it had better, &quot;but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, has left marks the last day.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Between - time the journalist Guido Hoyos, the journal Cromos sees the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgeries she had suffered. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgeries are good, but Valle has not been able to. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body has never been its asset and she lost because of this aspect. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this price, that the National Contest of Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuit has emerged a cruel prediction that was done yesterday evening, saying that this was a small gift that Raymundo to Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Réalité or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year, not as sovereign, or as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by appointment of the Contest National. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will go down in history as one of the queens that despite his dazzling move by Cartagena, has not won the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste of Cali is history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The past November 4, a dactyloscopiste of the Cali ITC has history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, by confronting his fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had to spend five days in the forest to reach the place in which were the bodies that were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something very big expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday night is party to Cauca Palmira in a helicopter. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew he had to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world&apos;s oldest guerrilla, therefore asked to take the card with the ten Guillermo León Sáenz fingerprint (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognised by his physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don&apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink sampling, and a lamp, Eliazar has compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye was deceived: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In research footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos is to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano,&quot; is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people is not our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In part to identify bodies, the dactyloscopistes supports the investigation for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When are caught, many have false identity cards or have no documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take their fingerprints and seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a boot - very full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we have been able to get the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights,&quot; he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> For interlude investigation has determined that a relative can be suspect of the crime and a footprint on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if this No guarantees that it is not the killer, that the place on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste of the ITC said it extracted &quot;fingerprints objects with physical or chemical reagents.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, using a sampling or a band for the levy. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> In addition, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the data base of offenders, or the National Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombian,&quot; said the expert of the ITC. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that not everything is how it shows in the television programme CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As all that glitters is not gold, all that touches is not necessarily a footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> It can be used, if the confrontation is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of protesters crowded in Zuccotti place to camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A lot of people have acceded to the evacuation order and has moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The movement&apos;s integrative Occupe defied Wall Street Tuesday New York authorities trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of protesters crowded outside the place Zuccotti, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows&apos; outraged &apos;camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there has been new judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stand again in the place, we will install in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,&quot; said - a door - words &quot;Occupe Wall Street,&quot; Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray has detailed the answer of &apos;outraged&apos; to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order which prohibited the forced evacuation of the place, and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Moreover, the &apos;indignant&apos; occupied a new park located at the confluence of power stations Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, between New York and New Jersey, property of the parish, Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the Police is moved and arrested a few protesters, although Bray could not confirm the figure concrete Efe, the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there are 100 people who were in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Between - time, place Zuccotti - which is a forum of private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which we must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some protesters moved previously focused and handing out at this time - where copies of this judicial order and they were the same to the officers who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small clashes, &quot;said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply the laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to park with tents or other properties they used before. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The Mayor Bloomberg said that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, to which he was alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow to settle with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The councillor has personally championed the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti, an operation during which was arrested 200 people and that was because of the fact that the protesters&apos; violated the law. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg said he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming &quot;a place where people came to protest, but for violating the laws and in some cases, to do harm to other people,&quot; because &quot;some stores had received threats&quot; and residents were afraid &quot;to their quality of life.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more concerned to defend the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the door - floor of the movement, which accused the mayor &quot;not to respect freedom of expression.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The Occupe &quot;Wall Street&quot; have also said they did not think hold &quot;major actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on September 17. </seg>

<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, data of gross domestic product between July and September served to definitively turn the page: GDP has raised a 1.5% from the prior quarter and a 6 percent annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Anyone registered the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is due, in part, by the recovery of the acquisition of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, the companies have increased their investments by 1.1 percent, compared to the decline of 0.9 percent of capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increases not - interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan has awakened thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable has raised a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The yen&apos;s stigma </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo is handed over to the internal market when the yen the Japanese currency - - has become a &quot;safe-haven&quot; elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger divides, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their weak results between July and September the assessment of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not drop the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must follow the risks persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; reported yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of Member countries have presented in September clearer signals of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are curtailed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Because it fell four decimal points up to 100,4 points, compared to 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Eurozone was even by - below the average, which is in the 100 level, dropping eight decimal points up to 99,13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens is fueling new doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Tories not sign any written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty relocated in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The sensation of the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional government is Helennic; rather imposed by the demands of Brussels by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days establishes in its designation may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures in no case and reiterated its demand new elections for the datte scheduled for 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras No emerging doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to help the transitional government, but we are committed to nothing more.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse that EU and IMF, organizations must release the 8,000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of commitment adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by the will - all of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not help if the new government and leaders of the main parties hellènes do not sign &quot;a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The door - floor of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika would return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot;the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, even if there is a definite date. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek still have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The Queen Sofía: &quot;These are instruments for progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen stresses the &quot;paramount&quot; to Spain in relation to this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has reached a prominent place at global level in the role of Micro-finances.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in relation to this cooperation instrument which &quot;the essence&quot; lies in the fact that it is &quot;an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen opened yesterday the V - e World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, in particular, has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes under a dollar a day, which is set the poverty threshold. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;in all corners of the planet, and this task with&quot; responsibility, &quot;reported the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the summit, which will last until Thursday,&quot; guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, &quot;the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have achieved many objectives &quot;and&quot; we face many challenges. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a for debate, but also as the platform from which to spearhead &quot;two basic goals.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there has 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty threshold in which they now live. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;followed the trail initiated a few years ago in a pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she has described the father of this instrument as an &quot;idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty,&quot; the work which she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen has travelled to Bangladesh to get on the ground its lending policy. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as those held in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I could see a continuing evolution,&quot; said His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term &quot;head of family&quot; meeting in Valladolid from &quot;as the deep pocket of the poor.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofía finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;ethical&quot; Impératif </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Extérieures Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is &quot;a permanent obligation.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that micro-credits assume &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not let that be the victim of the cutbacks. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation for development.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success of&quot; give &quot;trust&quot; the people &quot;excluded which all close the door&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León the Riva, welcomed the people in a city that opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage, European </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the convention of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, ran without real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also president of the Christian Democratic party -. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme but finished in the fall, particularly to meet the militants who consider government policy too lenient towards the Greeks today and the Italians tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously -. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes to which have been right at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, very Europhile did not place in doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea - mistress of Chancellor - and the motion – is a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> That could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage &quot;to give a face to Europe.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> That is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty - Seven agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the weight of each economy, which of course was to strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Seeking to ease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has repeated references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its congress on the back of the &quot;smaller&quot; European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of the &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> In recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What does fraud rulings disease? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the benefits, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments disease. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurring theme - since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social handouts. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the judgments disease. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First in a goal of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose the employees of the private waiting a fourth day before taking charge of a work stoppage. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In clear, specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days wages, so at least 15 percent of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that threatens to spark anger, but which would yield EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: the civil servants waiting a day not compensated in the event of work stoppage (they so far have not waiting period against three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority also stimulus the issue of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to the work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you rembourserez,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, November 13. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As for other cases, the announcement effect seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to the work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is the subject since 2002 of constant monitoring and offensives policies, which have often borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Attardons we first on the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros per diem allowances were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute of research and documentation in health economics, daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 5 percent of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this, $46% were the maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were the judgments disease, or 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And therefore 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French on average 14.5 days of work stoppage, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average to hide some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of 40 000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day off sick. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time of the Sickness, states that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11 percent in the - beyond. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely that the stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) perched in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15 percent in the United Kingdom - or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands -. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud rulings disease is very little work in the black. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As to the fraud, it reached a low scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 that the systematic checks are on the judgments of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, about 1.5 million tests, the CNAM found that 13% of 285 000 made for short-term rulings were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; 37 050 case. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, routinely checked, there were 11% of cases &quot;inappropriate or unwarranted&quot; on 1.2 million, or 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total, 169 000 cases &quot;unjustified,&quot; on several million employees who had a disease. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure which represents little face, for example, of the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP lawmaker Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, or more than the total cost of the daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will apply a new adjustment plan </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece will need a further adjustment programme to revive its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> That is what said Monday 14 November the prime minister, Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government would not be sufficient to accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme,&quot; said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27, will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, because the country&apos;s participation in the euro zone &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> As a result, Mr. Papadémos has forecast that the country&apos;s public deficit will be reduced to &quot;around 9%&quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6 percent in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right wing refuses new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing Monday expressed its support for the measures already agreed to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage on additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favour of new measures,&quot; he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combat the waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> A Olli Rehn, the European commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU does not would contribute US loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written guarantee to all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his floor enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It must legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, institutions of health care, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that - beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian company lives in denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to this effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The committee recommends that the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice, with a patient deemed competent to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Médicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts are mandated by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish that have most Canadians to die at home, $68.6 percent of them eventually dying in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths at the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there was no evidence that decriminalization of abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on competent persons not willing or not. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, said yesterday in a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, there would be many more cases go precisely where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians support euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people who practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In terms of retention or termination of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> So, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The Committee of Experts also urge that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a refusal by the end of life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, institutions of health care, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that - beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in the field of palliative sedation or terminal illness, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce the physical pain, such as euthanasia, and it is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reserves of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Mr. Pierre Fields, a specialist in health law, called &quot;extreme&quot; the position of experts signatories of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask what help to suicide,&quot; said Mr. Fields, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr. Fields also stresses that the authors of the report seem to put the autonomy of the individual - above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, she called it &quot;manifesto pro-euthanasia.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, either in the Netherlands, and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave power </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Damascus denounced a &quot;plot&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Syria is increasingly isolated </seg>
<seg id="2556"> Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday outside the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their resists and denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against the country. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took position in favour of a departure of President Assad. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to leave power &quot;in Syria, where 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;If Bashar had to heart the interest of his country, he should resign, but it should also create conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics,&quot; said King of Jordan&apos;s neighbour, Syria, in an interview with the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> For its part, the Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> &quot;Those who are not in peace in the Middle East - with their people and cannot meet will leave,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring country which Turkey adopted an increasingly tough line. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The United States are on their side welcomed a &quot;strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime&quot;, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> &quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly hard&quot; against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a door - floor of the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime have been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> Two other civilians were killed &quot;in crossfire and shelling with heavy machine guns to Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country is &quot;heading towards the end of the crisis.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> It has also reacted strongly to the Arab League decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which is &quot;a dangerous step.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> &quot;Syria does not shrink,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;the ourdis plots against Syria will fail.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a &quot;mechanism of protection of civilians&quot; and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also said to support the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians of the repression of the regime which he said is the &quot;paranoia.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat on the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of forces from cities in the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested. </seg>

<seg id="2576"> The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a bit of time to markets to form his team and implement a program, which will include &quot;sacrifices&quot; to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before now meet the unions and employers. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> It should put in place a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> &quot;Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Mr Nucara, MP for one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after he met the President of the Council. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said expect Mario Monti requests by a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has enough support. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The consultations will end by the presentation by Mr Monti of a restricted list, probably a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Mr Monti said the nervousness of the bond and stock markets yesterday, asking them time. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In &quot;democracy, there are deadlines&quot; to prepare a government and its programme, he said, saying he was &quot;certain that the markets will be patient and understand.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The first minister designate should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include &quot;political.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Mr Monti is committed, once entered office, to work in the emergency and in order that Italy will &quot;protagonist&quot; in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> A door - floor of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of a balanced budget in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has asked for new austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia, who will on Tuesday, insisted on the need to revive the economy, &quot;because a country that has not of growth may not meet the parameters of deficit.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994 – 2004), represents a &quot;change of time&quot; to Italy after 17 years of &quot;berlusconisme&quot;, the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizing the &quot;serious challenge&quot; and &quot;another Italy,&quot; according to the editorialists. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> The great unknown will be the longevity of his team. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The President Napolitano would avoid early elections because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of government bonds. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist helped Iran&apos;s nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday the American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety and other documents from the UN agency to identify. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The IAEA said last week its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimensions&quot; of Iran&apos;s nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to ISIS dipping widely in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center at Chelyabinsk, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing &quot;nano-diamants&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic problems of its society have led to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> He then allegedly cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its latest report, the IAEA is &quot;strong indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system&quot; has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, which not only knew this technique, but, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> The anti-Muslim crimes and offences rose 50% </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, the other racial and religious violence have fallen slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims is past 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 percent increase, against a rise of 13 percent of the violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against Jews and an increase of 14 percent of crimes and offences anti-religious. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; rose marginally to 6 628 cases, including 47.3 percent motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again,&quot; said the human rights organisation Human rights First, &quot;the increase in antimusulmanes violence is particularly significant,&quot; the organization said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First has long said that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights,&quot; said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses,&quot; he said, adding that this could happen by improving police reports on &quot;hate crimes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The &quot;hate crime&quot; in the US federal law is a legacy of the time of the fight for civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence linked to race, color, religion, origin and now sex. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Twitter changes its platform and is more similar to Facebook </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of his platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which is like a little more than Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> A new tab &quot;activity&quot; and another &quot;name&quot; to follow more legibly online, the activity of other &quot;Twittos,&quot; which follows the messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) and those who follow you. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> This allows whether they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have messages favorites, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> This new formula Twitter has been tested on a small percentage of users in August &quot;to be broadcast to the whole network Monday, told AFP the door - floor of Twitter, Carolyn Penner. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with terms somewhat esoteric (RT to pass a message to someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) doing the happiness insiders, opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the public networks Facebook and Google +. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> On the network, users debated with &quot;tweets&quot; decided on the interest of this innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> &quot;It is unnecessary, invasive, and it looks like too to Facebook,&quot; wrote @ jemb123. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> recording of a &quot;golden rule&quot; in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The coalition government of Social Democrat - Christian Democrat in power in Austria decided Tuesday to put in the constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget in order to reduce public deficits and avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies Austria&apos;s sovereign rating (triple A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who was even announced this decision after a council of ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6 percent, well above the - the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly - below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the solvency of Austria was downgraded one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interests in more each year,&quot; said Minister - Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria is following a request from the summit in Brussels of eurozone members of 26 October: the heads of state and government had called for the registration by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The device adopted by the Austrian government nears the &quot;German model&quot;, Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule. &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year of 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state will not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities will present balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The aim is to 2020 / 21 public debt below the 60 percent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Yen strong </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threat of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to mount. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene as we did the last time we see excessive volatility&quot; in yen exchange rate, said Mr Noda in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> This day, Tokyo has sold heavily yen against the dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had set a new record of force since 1945 against the greenback. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen is regularly picked up since, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar rose Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen, close to the levels that sparked the last speech. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This surge of the Japanese currency hurt exports of the archipelago because it said the cost of products Made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan fight to rebuild&quot; since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the area of the northern Tohoku - is), Mr Noda said that fears that the rising yen kills in the bud the fragile recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third global economic power has reconnected with growth in the third quarter - 1.5 percent from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of exports and household consumption June by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister said that the high yen did not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Finance Minister Jun Azumi, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, suggesting that no additional monetary easing was expected Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> At its last meeting in late October, the rose 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasuries, to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling amounts it devotes to financial securities purchases to flood the market liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Eurozone: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> rates go up, the flanchent stock </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The risk of contagion of the debt crisis undermines the European indexes. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of the countries affected continue their ascent. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Also worried for the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets are a little more in negative territory on Tuesday November 15. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent to 3.064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The DAX in Frankfurt and London give 0.4% 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;With the new tensions on the bond yields of euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7 percent, with his round of renewed fears of market stakeholders about Europe&apos;s ability to contain the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, is riveted on Europe and the trade in a narrow corridor of variations as investors will not be evidence that the situation is stabilized,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> This renewed worries about the future of the eurozone penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Around 10 a.m., the European currency is 1,3570 dollar, falling 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to brokers, it fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in congress passed a motion on Monday, including the possibility for a country struggling to get out of the eurozone without leaving the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The borrowing rate of Italy and Spain remain at levels very worrying. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, the same Spanish securities mature 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to stoke fears of speakers. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the Italian government Mario Monti called time markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is in the sights of markets, while parliamentary elections held Sunday in the country. </seg>

<seg id="2670"> In the expectation growth figures the euro zone </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The statistics, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 percent expected, brought by household consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The Insee, revised down the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And, it really is the fourth most concerned about the economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, meanwhile, has registered a growth of 0.5 percent over the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> A first estimate for the whole euro area is expected at 11am, while the European Commission warn against the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts should prevail on the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If it is a subject that we cannot treat from short-term considerations or under the &quot;emotion, it is the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of the electricity directly affect purchasing power and on the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that an election date is the opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that is nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only be successful if he explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet &quot;, the&quot; demographic changes will lead to a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge part of the global population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will have to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce the electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident does none of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> That is why Germany remains isolated in his decision to give up nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is the case of Belgium, who submitted his to the need to find a replacement source can replace, or Switzerland, which is just not build the latest generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States have decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park in the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will be translated by the rise in the price of electricity the energy dependence, a worsened by the increasing reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas plants and to coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is to ponder. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe of the wind, &quot;which he gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; under what, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of more than 40 percent of French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalised economy the cost of the energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial tool on the national territory, French companies enjoy the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> In fact, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory fine statements on the redevelopment of our country and the defence of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Remember that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial sector 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Heavily export, it causes a galaxy of SMEs specializing on international markets and makes them very creative non-relocatable jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, this would sacrifice many of these SMEs in reducing alarmingly 6 billion annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electrician ordered an EPR designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of electricity production of miracle, as there is diabolical. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva solutions CO2 emitting little, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementarity of sources of energy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For the nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> We have a safety authority in France, which has control intransigent and transparent on existing plants as on the Flamanville site. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> A single, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without consequence human or environmental. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did for the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The product of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and the French and German manufacturers, the PRT presents a design making it able to resist such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> So it is considered by all the electricians eager to build a plant, the judgment of its construction at Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to competitors of Areva and EDF in their leaving the way free to grab the leadership in the development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the &quot;emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate a debate as crucial to the economic, financial and social situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various ways - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status &quot;human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who made the news, the interior minister (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France &quot;did not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is rarely analysed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is there on this issue a fairly broad consensus between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that &quot;¥900 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers,&quot; and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot accommodate all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the degree of generosity that we are prepared to pay towards immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, Francois Hollande is restricted to platitudes, indicating that the co-development will solve our &quot;migration problem.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps going off; but it is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the recall economists and Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (: How Migration Shaped orphans of Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restricting immigration anemia growth and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may substitute for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary that substitutes for national employees, for most of the jobs in sectors in shortage of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training is not following the offer of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon will have trouble working in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% rise of migratory flows increase between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants also are net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimated that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less expenses) of 150,000 euros public budgets on average over the whole of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the start of the mandate, go look for the missing growth &quot;with teeth.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth, to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, remains to think European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a very fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should remember him for having invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, has known throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some were able to believe that it would be enough for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the exercise in the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, since Napoleon &quot;Little,&quot; it was a facility of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, enlightenment, solidarity, economic and social justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is equally and a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The palinodie faked the Greek referendum will have to double value: the need for a return of powerful political, but also the disquieting sense of his impossibility, its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thought to be outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today are displaced, and that, for many of them, the soldiers Republicans do more in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organised the needs and dispersed. </seg>

<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want cut-off but a common exercise of calm and continuous, the choice and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There was no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - cannot be more where stop the list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe, which bends to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The emergency is to restore the popular sovereignty flying of the European project. </seg>

<seg id="2763"> Either. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think without a democratic political integration and stronger, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new stage of European integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To make the Republic in France, it took &quot;do&quot; of Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> That lesson remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a more integrated Europe economically. </seg>

<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed. </seg>

<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now &quot;satisfied.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way the two organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,&quot; he said without elaborating. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to do a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnappés in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM, Antoine Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time that several of their abductors during an operation by French special forces. </seg>

<seg id="2807"> Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has travelled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to AQIM and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is a step forward, but it should probably expect more formal evidence before talk of operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and external intellectuals and that she is increasingly active,&quot; said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the development and speeches of Boko Haram or operating methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and even invoice as those used by AQIM. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, to begin by Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have long viewed the group as a community of visionaries little worthy of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A rapid success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram haoussa - which means &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association has a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicizing and requires a strict observance of Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> They aim of all churches, bars, authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, Boko Haram militants are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuance. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The military invests the city, there are 800 people. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Therefore the sect will radicalise and leave his northern strongholds. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> At last Christmas, she claims an attack that left 80 people dead in Jos, then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram has secured police headquarters in a suicide attack, his first. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis operating in Africa Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria now anxious all security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> So that AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, that Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters may believe. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other multiplying thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often not supported - mounts. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and the challenge &quot;for manipulation of their currency,&quot; a theme porter in an America exasperated by the migration of swathes of its industry to Asia. </seg>

<seg id="2839"> He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>

<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> It is far from the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to put water in his wine in counterterrorism. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> The North Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests including four Heads of State and Government participated last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and smorgasbord end, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve together commander the entry of Russian gas in the western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km from the area of St. Petersburg in the Land of Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, the total to 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And we already mentioned the possibility of building a third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge project has the air of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream will enable us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh in on Russia by threatening to shut down access to European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a &quot;new Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is to say if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The Western Europe, supporting the Russian proposal, has gained greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a rift between Europeans, East and West. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has known, in five years ago, to his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,&quot; Fillon said in opening this pipeline, showing how the major gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine is in gainé steel tube of concrete to protect against the anchors of ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 metres on average. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> For the build, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the North Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> He also took measures to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops on its entire length: or valve, or maintenance station. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A platform of control was planned off Sweden, but officials have abandoned the project while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company moving permanently off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak, the gas content in the pipeline escapes in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned the welds to know a leak every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is provided by a robot under - sailor, dragged by a ship for external monitoring, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> In the form of a cigar, it is brought inside the tube, wide a metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> In the end, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 feet a second, precise information on the possible distortions of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without any compensation. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The movement of the gas is simply provided by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 to the finish. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to realize this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader remains Gazprom, which retains a 51% stake. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> If there are joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie&apos;s and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> She has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then leased to this company for 20 years, the entire gas transport capacity. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually taken,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The funding of the construction of the pipeline has been assured to 30% by shareholders and 70 percent by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment has risen to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are safe to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline pine planted. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Some 4.5 metres tall, valves, form the exit door of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas each hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine notebook, a mark. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Established about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine to restore the taste of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It smacks of adventure, hours to write to light a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with his black rectangular coverage, his elastic, leaves a white colour, as outdated by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Still, the Moleskine notebook as we know today was born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a notebook design but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book is based on an ancient technique of production, the mole skin (skin of mole) which means a cotton veneer used to cover benches by example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of notebook was very popular writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has returned to the fore a subject old and forgotten, that was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi, since the head of the mark in Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26 percent to 12.7 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine transcends borders Italian and exported in 70 countries, France until the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to establish a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook seduced both the businessman that the student and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in the bookshops, the Internet to small shops in downtown and was able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the air time and this new writing, despite the rise of e-mail,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signing with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists put their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it has also launched a leopard, coverage at the Locarno Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, covers of computer... The brand is on a whole range of mediums. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that was envied: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19 percent of people with disabilities are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive policy implementation in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still more than twice the average: 19% versus 9% for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Décourageant? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, said Eric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of disabled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made since 15 years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;It is still a great deal to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, the many obstacles remain before access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are aged: 37 percent have more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80 percent do not have the box and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, 10 000 only are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, all of which criteria hampering the return to employment, and which &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; said Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> That is for the brakes objectives. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> The unspoken, attitudes are changing, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study in April by the association IMS - Entreprendre for the City indicated that managers surveyed &quot;a low level of knowledge of disability,&quot; with a &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, intellectual or psychological functioning.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> As a result, private companies of more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment 6% of disabled workers, set in a law... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest figures available, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3 percent,&quot; said Pierre Blanc, director general of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The evidence: the number of institutions &quot;taxed&quot;, as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a pressure on companies,&quot; said Pierre White. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in the big groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 percent of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before face the Blues on Tuesday night (7) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that makes this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It will not go up to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side-by-side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the gesture of mood of striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I am very happy to Eden, its progress and the fact that it is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to go ahead,&quot; the Lillois. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> The contrast between its benefits and club selection, &quot;it is a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;At Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;It is necessary that I take my marks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Ménagé against Romania late Friday for this game against France at Saint-Denis, Hazard is to &quot;shine.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without fail, however, the concept of &quot;fun&quot;. </seg>
