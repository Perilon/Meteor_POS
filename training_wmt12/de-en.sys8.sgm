<seg id="1"> No releasing novella for Tymoshenko by the parliament </seg>
<seg id="2"> Today the Ukrainian parliament refused the application to abolish that section within the scope of a novella of the Criminal Code on whose basis the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The representatives rejected the reorganisation which could have paved the way for the freeing of the imprisoned ex-prime minister with the second reading of the application for alleviation of the punishments for economic offences. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Timoshenko had been condemned in October because of the end of a supposedly disadvantageous contract with Russia about the purchase by natural gas to seven years of custody. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The judgment is not legal yet, in December the appeal of the convicted should be negotiated in court. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Timoshenko itself calls the judgment political revenge of the regime and also in the west the process let arise the suspicion of the prepossession of the court. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The application, section 365 on whose basis the ex-prime minister was condemned to remove from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 representatives. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 226 voices would have been necessary to his acceptance. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of the Libyan fight for independence or Libyan rebellion already knows her losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar al-Gaddafi lies at an unknown place in the desert buried and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now only the winners are to be defined. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Like him of this region commonly, islamists win in the elections, the question is only, which - the temperate ones or the radical ones. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The national transitional advice confessed to the customary law of the Scharīʿa from which one has a certain image now with God. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya would become the country without criminal activity, because for theft one chops off in short the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Also women should forget thought of emancipation as soon as possible, possible religious apostate are executed, et cetera. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of one single dictator the society from mutually being feuding trunks is united in future by the Koran. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In short - in Libya an order will rule which would be hardly conceivable in this country and would be above all hardly desirable. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Only - our life style is not simply the only and objectively seen probably also not the best and would hardly fit change the mentioned Libyans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Thus seen it is rather strange that the Muslim&apos;s fighters can be helped generally from the incredulous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Only the fact may probably serve for her excuse that the air raids of NATO were escorted not by any general from America, but by Allah himself whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The winners in Libya? The west does not belong to it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We took part only in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians ridded themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this would have brought any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we rather refrained from a military occupation of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The local thereby get rid of a worry - namely the expulsion of the crusaders. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Do the mineral oil enterprises get the black gold dirt cheap, however, also without occupation? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Finally, hardly and thus the west can boast once rightly of his unselfishness in the matter of protection of the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If this do not spoil for them the Scharīʿa representatives. </seg>

<seg id="55"> Thanks to a goalkeeper Čech well in the mood and a marvellous gate of Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0. </seg>
<seg id="56"> With a big serving of luck the Czech football could defend thus his luxurious projection of the home match and will not be absent once again with the European championship. </seg>
<seg id="57"> IHNED.cz pursued the rise play in a detailed report. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Little excitement in the first half time and a gigantic serving luck in the second ones. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The Czech choice also won thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliantly Čech&apos;s and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro rather happily 1:0 and has redeemed therefore her ticket for the Fußball-EM. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Also because of the exact defensive play of the Czech Mannschaftkonnten they put under pressure the Montenegriner only in the second half time more. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The unlucky people of the part were Damjanovic and Vucinic who used up two gigantic chances. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also thanks to excellent Petr Čech the Czech choice the next year will be involved in the European championships, it is pleasing also that a premium runs towards the home football at the rate of approx. 200 millions. </seg>
<seg id="63"> From the first minutes rather combative football was played. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Both teams inferred protracted and thus it was played above all for the centre line. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Also in the second half time the pressure of the home team was missing and the wide reductions before the penal space were repulsed by the Czech defence successfully. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Iranian students are ready to die for the core programme of her country. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They formed a living shield. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Some Hundred university students formed a living shield round about around a core object in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="69"> With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate her support for the core programme of her country before a possible Israeli attack. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The students had prayed Tuesday midday before the object and afterwards to the USA and Israel had announced the death. </seg>
<seg id="71"> A few Hundred students of the university in the Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield round about around the core technology centre in Isfahan on Tuesday, in the uranium is processed. </seg>
<seg id="72"> With it they wanted to make known that they are ready, the core programme of her country to protect if necessary also with her own life. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The International nuclear energy agency (IAEA) recently ascertained in her report, Iran has not given up apparently his efforts towards a nuclear weapon long ago. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Also in Israel speaks of a possible attack on Iranian core arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Students had prayed at the midday before the entrance to the complex and afterwards to the USA and Israel had announced the death. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The menu of a child addicted to fat: It does not have breakfast and eats sausage to the supper </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than one third of the children of from 9 to 13 problems with overweight have and 9 percent of all schoolboys and 5 percent of all children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Topical surveys proved - adipöse children mostly come from families with injurious life style. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Thus appears once again how important for the healthy development of a person the environment is in which he grows up and which are examples which surround him. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Sausages stand on the tables of adipöser children up to half more often on the table, than in the families in which normal-weighty children live. </seg>
<seg id="82"> The day before more than 19 percent of the overweight children had of the clarification action under the motto &quot;Adipositas no chance is&quot; chips to the supper. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with chubby chops sport also counts not exactly to the favorite employments what concerns, however, also the majority of the today&apos;s schoolboys - answered only 15 percent that her parents the least time once a week are found for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey among 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey took place the last year by the end of the school year, besides, nearly 900 children from elementary schools were questioned in completely Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="86"> This was already the second year of the action &quot;Adipositas is no chance&quot; which is supported by the general health insurance scheme and the society of Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Up to now took part in the project more than 12 000 schoolboys from the 4th and 8th classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Besides, injurious food and missing movement in the family are determining factors which are responsible for the alarmingly rising number of children with overweight or even obesity. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the questioned children stated, for example, 5 spot on the day to eat Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot in the mode breakfast second - one of the main conditions for a healthy food&quot;, so there is one of the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and sausage to the supper </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts refer to the fact that also relative little things, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, importantly for the healthy development of a child are. </seg>
<seg id="92"> However, in Czechia only 23 percent of the families of the schoolboys have breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And - in most families everybody has breakfast for itself alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The statement which is not had breakfast in every tenth family at all was worst. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Besides, the breakfast is valid as a foundation-stone of the healthy day-to-day food. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Among the rest, the survey test brought to light that one consumes chips injurious much more often in the families of overweight children. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everybody - without taking into consideration the weight - drinks every day sweet lemonades (70 percent) </seg>
<seg id="98"> Though more than 40 percent of the questioned children go in for sports, but only less than half of her parents only 15 percent do this - namely. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Put together to you your own menu </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey enabled to well-chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together her own menu to themselves from offered possibilities after appetite and opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 as regards food, is far away from the ideal of a healthy food. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Under her favourite dishes there were many flour dishes, meat courses and of course sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Above all the big popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming&quot;, it is stressed in the final report for this survey. </seg>
<seg id="104"> With the lunch, so to the main course, pasta won scarcely before fowl. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Legumes did not like the children st not at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as a lunch was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Hinkehr to the health </seg>
<seg id="107"> However, at the same time the survey also showed that the children are absolutely ready to change her eating habits if they get right information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;With the control group of the survey partner, they the questionnaires after end of the clearing up talk &quot;Adipositas is no chance&quot; filled, a clear movement of the preferences was to be registered in many cases to principles of the healthy food&quot;, is stated in the results of the project. </seg>
<seg id="109"> This was obvious, for example, with the sweet Limos where many children began to give the priority to usual water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children marked in the questionnaire also much more often fowl or fish than main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumpling or sweet dishes. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Profis behaupten - ein Stilist-Durcheinander auch ein guter Psychologe sein </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the prefatory article about as stylists learn, I had grumbled a little bit that this was a little too much materials for the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There I did not anticipate in the least what still comes. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Talks of three professionals from the branch, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar through how &quot;on the place&quot; runs. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It should come even more badly. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer the check moves, more information and practical duties approaches us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course everybody takes place on Saturdays and on Sundays, he is still completely booked. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we debated with manager Alena (in the course not a single one man takes part) as one draws a woman who has no ideally proportionierte figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And this are, at least, most from us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One have a too short neck, they change a too boyish figure without well-arranged curves and again other are plump. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is a thing of the stylist to conceal optically wide shoulders, to extend the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We also got tips as one draws a women&apos;s type like Jennifer Lopez - with big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - nicely and figure-emphatically, without she looks much too provocative. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference is so big between waist and hips that the rock or the trousers really does not fit, one should allow to tailor at least one piece to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> One will not regret this certainly, because well seated clothes are simply unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor-made rock one feels much better because than in one stands off from the pole which all the time high and slips in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Boyish figures can allow themselves again to carry clothing with folds, billowing, applications, embroideries or Raffung. </seg>
<seg id="127"> With this amount of information and figure type I am glad that I have time a whole week to let go everything thoroughly by the head. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And, nevertheless, I have fear that it is not almost to be created in view of the applied homework. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the course participants got because a VIP assigned for whom she should devise suitable outfits - day clothing and evening evening gown. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Besides, we should consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the suitable star and his figure type. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I should &quot;draw&quot; Miranda Kerr whom you possibly know from the campaign Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally, than to draw, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera who has increased in the last time probably in hundred kilos (well, this is exaggerated a little bit), or also the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We should cut out the clothes of magazines or look on the Internet, print out and afterwards graphically work on. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Then in the &quot;Moodboard&quot;, as the whole result is called, ours should be expressed quite personal style and our respect with the graphic creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is because very important to think also about the graphic side of the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist draws the models because not only purely physically, but also forms the so-called product side in the journal (after concrete default, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told to us about it. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> That is the fact that a stylist must have a good total view. </seg>
<seg id="140"> With information about figure type filled Saturday talk was immediately spiced by three visitors from the branch: </seg>
<seg id="141"> from the stylist Jan Pokorn ý, from the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and from the fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us of the fact that fashion is an illusion and which should be able a stylist to use this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And sent in stylist is able to work with one single clothing piece in quite different manner. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word is called variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Thus one can carry, for example, a trench coat as usual about the jeans, so like a T-shirt or coat, one can carry him, however, also on the naked body, draw sales shoes in addition and carry him as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collars and immediately the whole look looks completely different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Plays with it&quot;, he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> However, mostly the following advice suited me: &quot;First you must know the rules perfectly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Only then you may injure them&quot;, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, becomes clear to me, why we must swot up all these doctrines what one can combine with what and why, even if one gets to see often completely other in fashion magazines. </seg>
<seg id="151"> To be quiet completely from fashion looking. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Now thanks to the photographer Ben I know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variations than he takes photos at last. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So one must be prepared for a Fashion story with ten sides (speak ten outfits) of styling at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothing on the photo looks completely different, than in reality in combination with other accessories every now and then. </seg>
<seg id="155"> One must count on all with the creation of the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that image and Styling put out every now and then half of the success, this also confirmed to us Jan Pokorn ý. </seg>
<seg id="157"> There one needs to himself just Madonna to look at a not quite excellent singer from whom image and marketing have made a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Czechia one faces to the services of a stylist rather aloofly. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also known personalities hold this often for Rau-thrown money (which is a central issue that I bring something like I to it look is second-rate). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if already somebody can be styled by us, we should calculate on the fact that he or they forces upon us in all probability quite an other (smaller) size than he or they needs in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then afterwards one needs only to googlen to find out with certainty that the gutter press writes, the suitable VIP is closed again or taken, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday to the heart not to think that himself a stylist needs to focus only on the fashion and then &quot;to assemble&quot; the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> At his work he must communicate above all with the people whom he styles and he must be a clever psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People estimate without toadying and stand to his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If any manager orders us to sight her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, then we cannot clear to her the whole cupboard and say - my God, this is awful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;One must find at least a few commendable things to which one recommends what one can carry in addition&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us also quite specifically what must contain thus a so-called &quot;place pocket&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So such a pocket which one buttons up in the waist and in which one carries all necessary Proprietäten on himself. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Except such to clear things, like scissors, roller for the hair removing or safety pins she also contains such utensils like a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps himself while taking a photo of products like handbags or hats from), special clips with which behind the clothes are heaped if she is too big (pins or other clips are prohibited, so that the material does not break) and of course Nähzeug. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So that we not only must listen, but also can try out a little bit practically, we learnt how one untersticks shoes properly. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Also while taking a photo in the studio where the floor is level one can damage the shoe sole, never mind him outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="172"> We stuck ourselves o and stuck... </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the scissors one may not even touch the shoes, so that one does not damage them. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So one must go forward really cleverly. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario pleased me, while he praised my &quot;creation&quot; without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The mentioned skill is same not exactly my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only the fraction of that what we got to hear with in the second weekend continuation course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One has become clear to me, in the meantime - to devote itself to the styling at professional level, is no child&apos;s play. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need for speed: &quot;The of run&quot; - the unlawful running straight through America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> The originally carefree journey becomes an absolutely avoidable, dilettantish mistake the routine journey to the early shift by a series. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Though one succeeded in fulfilling largely the ambitions, but what this already uses if obviously nobody felt like acting a little bit more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Already before he came on the counters, the new part with the subtitle woke up &quot;The of run&quot; high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> If he promised, nevertheless to shift the quite elderly play series &quot;Need for speed&quot; again a piece in a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he seemed to be really not only one of many action-racing plays. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as the fitted passages precipitate in which the main protagonist from the car rises and goes on on foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as one is already accustomed with NFS, a lot is different in the final effect than one had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Certainly - potentially these are rather decent arcade runnings, but all together the play is curtailed by some superfluous mistakes which are present in this series more or less already during a few years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So these are, actually, no more mistakes, but rather signs of an in principle incomprehensible laziness of the play developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> First one is introduced in the history whose central figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an unlawful race straight through America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, so on the west coast, one sits down to the steering wheel - with the job to be as first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The whole route is split in ten stages and in more than fifty single runnings. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every running on other distance is delivered and that the single stages take place in different, enough different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> One has no moment the impression that play would offer the same over and over again. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some surroundings are to be looked in addition still really nicely, although the technical level of the graphics does not go out about of the former parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So nothing earthshattering. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey by the desert, by autumnal scenery or high on top by deeply snow-covered scenery look visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Every now and then atypical elements bring a little change in the single runnings. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a wild tower which limits the view strongly. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains again one must pay attention like hell that one is not buried by an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Besides, the single runnings are inserted rather well one after the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Though only some, but they reach. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while one tries in such a way to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle, a classical running), then one has to make up for time (then classical running against the stopwatch), expects still a personal duel with one single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And in addition the police which wants to mess up the whole thing to one still interferes. </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty are the passages in which Jack leaves the carriage. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Besides, it is rather about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees before somebody and where the player must help him, while he presses the right button at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So nothing complex. </seg>
<seg id="209"> However, it surprises that there is in the play much less of such passages than one would expect (specifically probably only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> At last this is to the thing rather to the advantage, because thus this element has at least no chance to become dull - it belongs in the context to above-said to the elements which make the play more diverse. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The driving model walks in the footprint of the preceding parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Though seen that is from today&apos;s point of view, it tears out no trees, on the other hand, one could not state, it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Who searches realistic simulations, must look around somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But the local driving model does justice to an action-loaded racing driving also furthermore quite well, although one could find better ones with the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Till then everything is so far in the best order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems appear only after certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not completely O.K. </seg>
<seg id="218"> From a play of this kind is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if one has notion practically before no impact on any object as the car behaves, then everything is not obviously in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typical example: With the narrow overhauling or driving past oncoming cars one &quot;touches&quot; at some places the other carriage only easily, one comes to other, nearly identical situation, however, in the skidding and turns wild pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or if the cart immediately goes to scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the rest kind system puts out though nothing else, from annoyingly it is always. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The Restarts are solved thus: if one has total loss or far lands off the distance, the play throws back to the last clue of the distance. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every running one has only five Restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If one has exhausted them, from the front everything goes off. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The Restarts are rather a sort of an aid, for the case that a little bit does not succeed, but on it one should not rather count. </seg>
<seg id="226"> However, sometimes does not help sometimes the rest kind, there nothing else helps, than to learn the critical segment from the head. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Really it is disagreeable that the same things often happen at the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> One must wear out some curves, for example, in quite specific way, otherwise one simply does not fit by. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Somewhere else one meets at the suitable place &quot;civil&quot; cars always in the same configuration, all the same whether one comes as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is irritating particularly in situations if one sees that the opponent goes past before playing to two oncoming cars, but until one himself comes there, the carriages are already in such a position that one must drive round them or brake. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it makes no difference, when one comes there, everything is so conceived because that it comes to this situation always close before your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have even other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> In the whole play there are a few places where one is always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without taking into consideration the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This is most mad for the end of the play on the long bridge which one passes in counterdirection. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must overtake here obviously like crazy. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if he is then already before one, he takes of course the view, so that one drives there in the beginning an own car a few times in Klump. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Clear - one wants to make the play simply exciting and more thrilling, however, this intention is so clear that she spoils fast the joy in the play. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And this is a pity, because is rather entertaining in spite of an easier driving model the play all together and here and there also in such a way action-loaded that one does not know almost any more where the head stands to one. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And, in principle, makes no difference what is &quot;responsible&quot; in it - the draught with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the runnings in a manner that no boredom can arise, or something else... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is also the carriage change in the course of the runnings. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Besides, one may not overlook the filling stations in the distance, because exactly here one can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient which one just has. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports-cars are well suitable for the urban areas, the strong American saloons for the straight highways and exotic super-sports-cars for the technical journeys, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the mode of the play history the mode of the problems (challenges) - the runnings also goes in the single places which one knows from the history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here there are not only medallions but also to win points of experience for own profile which is together for the duties (challenges) and the history. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To reach to the higher driver&apos;s level, different objects must be unlocked: started from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is connected at the same time with the on-line function autolog which compares, among the rest, own achieved results to their other player and also provides for other collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of other incomprehensible boobs is a situation in the last running of the history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here one comes because by the car to an underground tunnel (because of me) where one races in the darkness on the rails long (because of me). </seg>
<seg id="250"> On the speedometer figures look between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but there comes all at once from the back an underground and goes uncompromisingly to scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial staff we will still probably argue long about whether a blackout was the play creator or whether to us the authors hold for so stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is nothing overpowering, however, at least the visual overall impression is rather attractive in most cases and is even excellent here and there. </seg>
<seg id="253"> It is the more irritating that to itself with some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz become slower and this every now and then quite dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Nevertheless, this concerns in particular the accidents with bigger number of involving where nothing is useful to one a continuous FPS anyway. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste thing. </seg>
<seg id="256"> To respond in the endeavours, an as wide as only possible scale of rather young audience, did a soundtrack a lá &quot;from everybody originate a little bit&quot; - but who buys to himself such a play already because of the music?! </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of Need for speed: The run? The feelings are rather mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the play was not curtailed by the mentioned absolutely unnecessary mistakes, we could have stated with the chest note of the conviction that The run is the best piece of NFS during the last years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But thus the play looks anyhow incomplete. </seg>
<seg id="260"> In for himself a first-class pleasure, but one should be prepared for the fact that to one these mistakes with the power of airport floodlights sting in the eyes. </seg>

<seg id="276"> EU ambassadress Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The contract of Lisbon has brought the balance under the single institutions noticeably from the plumb line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not have expected that such a hard war breaks out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will last five, six years, until the waves have smoothed and become have got used to everybody to her new role&quot;, Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassadress began at the European Union, rather sharply her talk at the law school. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How seriously she takes the motto &quot;Understandably and openly over Europe&quot;, she already pointed in the first part of her talk in which she succeeded in describing the single organs of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable manner that she quite a lot of foreign language assistant of the law school of the Karl&apos;s university could have envied this. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Besides, Mrs. Vicenová also praised the new constant chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;In the beginning criticism was expressed, he is too unobtrusive - a grey official who has not grown of such a role, but I must say, it has taken away to all the breath how well he has taken care of the thing. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a person who manages to listen patiently 27 member states, to communicate with them and the images clear above all has of how it should go on with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> She explained the new position of the high representative for Foreign Affairs and security policy then as an answer to the question: Who is this, actually - the European Union? Which number should I call? &quot;, so as an important step to the arrangement and better legibility of the EU politics compared with states, as for example China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to forbid our Ölmützer Quargel to us </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs. Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and in close future thinks to live. </seg>
<seg id="288"> She called the Czech chairmanship from two years ago success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also would have organised the summit for eastern partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> She called the case of the government during the chairmanship big Negativum which has strongly damaged to the image of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU deals currently all hands completely. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Said with the words of the ambassadress, it went not only with the chairmanship, but also with the next crisis which is not overcome till this day yet rather hectically to. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there the seven-year budget of the EU must be still approved what makes the thing just because of the today&apos;s economic situation much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it a slender and sparing budget is promoted which branches of industry receive priority which countries more and which less - now all this is on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassadress also reminds of her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: &quot;Understandably over Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;If I may not a little bit, these are grayish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon which nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How I should know as a citizen, actually whether one to themselves in Brussels really crooked or round cucumbers and big bananas passed away devises or whether somebody really wants to forbid to us the Quargel. </seg>
<seg id="298"> She would have used the ground of the EU also with pleasure for it to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of two or different speeds in view </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to opinion of the EU ambassadress the Czechs are in the call to be Eurosceptics, which more the negative ones than the positive sides of the thing perceive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is the more annoyingly. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Many factors are to blame for it, among the rest, also the restraint of our candidates, inability to write motivation letters and not least also the weak support of the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Except the successful Czech chairmanship she also lifted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called. V4 out. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the French believes beside me: &quot;Hey what do you fit together there the heads - is again your V4?&quot; and, besides, makes a quite sour look. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Mrs. Vicenové above all hard rules expect the EU in future for the budget politics of the member states. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As much more honestly than a &quot;European federation&quot; she looks at the draught of Europe of two or even to different speeds. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries off the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen space and we already have the institute of an encouraged cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time it was said that only the countries should work together which want it and which, do not want, should stand quietly apart.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be more and more of such institutions what runs out at last to strong &quot;Europe of the different speeds&quot;&quot;, expects Mrs. Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this regard she also appreciated the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuyes in the penetration of the principle according to whom all subjects with effect on the whole EU must be discussed by all member states and not only from the countries of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Geschichte der Marke: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The Innovator IBM steps the second century of his existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If one wanted to look according to a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most exactly characterises, then this would probably be the word &quot;Longevity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the wide public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern enterprise, although since his foundation already one century has passed by. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis to this longevity already laid her first boss - which visionary Thomas J. Watson sen. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems can be easily solved if the people were ready to think a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; became thus the brand name around which the life of the future giant should happen (and at the same time to the title of the company internal magazine which one started to publish in IBM already in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the enterprise culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement in the direction of future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was also successful, therefore, a whole century because there has remained loyal to his principles and not before it zurückschreckte to change all other all around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This permitted us to transform the technologies, the business and also the society in the course of our first century. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope which we create during the next hundred years even more&quot;, said Samuel J. Palmisano, the today&apos;s manager of the enterprise on the occasion of the jubilee. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Thought-out system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson already pursued during the thirties years social care of his employees - in similar manner, how the enterpriser Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid-up vacation, an assurance by the enterpriser plus elegant uniforms as a working clothing and a thought-out remuneration system of the best innovator and trader. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Just also the long-term relations are thought out by IBM with her customers. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The enterprise was brilliant from the outset in the talent support - as one of the first companies IBM lifted worldwide any Diskrimination - and could select itself accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In harmony with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the present plan, the Palmisan at the head by IBM next year of a woman is alternated - from Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It is already present thirty years in IBM, up to now it took the position of the Vetriebs-boss, marketing boss and strategy boss. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes during the last years so-called on-line brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations arise. </seg>
<seg id="331"> There is no miracle - ideas enough, in the enterprise nearly half a million people is occupied. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good call </seg>
<seg id="333"> Their steadfast position in the business guarantees for the enterprise a strong image and this after Inside and after Outside. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the outset IBM had rather the draught of an institution than of a bare technology enterprise&quot;, Economist said the professor Harvard business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is no technology enterprise, but a company which helps to solve commercial problems help of technologies&quot;, George Colony of Consulting company Forrester Research added. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the enterprise itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present at the market or to form him by this presence directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - in the states of her logo because of informally &quot;Big Blue&quot; called, has grown up in a century into one of the biggest enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most many-sided technology enterprises generally - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation achievements in an unbelievable product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> From all American technology enterprises IBM owns most patents and already five his employees were distinguished with the Nobel prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> E.g., cash dispensers, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code or also the disk belong to his best known inventions. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approx. 220 milliard dollars of market value (market capitalisation) IBM this year was the second largest technology enterprise (immediately to Apple) and it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The look ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers from today - unhappily the calculators were, for example, the attempt with own operating system OS/2, the on-line service Prodigy or also IBM PC jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Business is based on the Vorwärtsbewegung, so one may not bind himself emotionally to the past&quot;, believes about it Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem to build his foundation walls on different platforms - and if they do not function to leave them also again. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to the opponent Microsoft which stands, in principle, with his operating system Windows and falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> Services take part in the biggest measure in the profits of IBM, software and hardware take part too in each case to one fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Besides, hardware with a more than 50-percent portion was strongest represented still in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Nevertheless, since 2000 disposed IBM little profit throwing down assets to the value of 15 milliard dollars, in the same time it invested 58 milliard dollars in the purchase of future-laden technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In this Investionen IBM also continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time like a storm about the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Also here IBM to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson remained loyal who raised his investment dimension in the middle of the big worldwide economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Up to now it seems that the enterprise IBM gets over the today&apos;s crisis regardless of. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 rocket-like about 120 percent and the clear profit of the enterprise grows kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The enterprise slogan of IBM is: everything cannot be changed - only the values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also, therefore, may be expected that this adaptable giant also masters the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: From the cheese tailor to universe flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> In the beginning 100 years ago in New York founded society IBM (Internationally business Machines) had a surely complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> She took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was about a brand name for an establishment in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The coalescence of four enterprises whose history goes back till the 80s of the 19th century laid the foundation-stone to the later society IBM. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They owned technologies as for example the famous Stechkartenuhren to the registration of the working beginning and working end. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Charles Ranlett Flint who also held the chairmanship in the supervisory board till 1930 became the architect of this new enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint who put the boss of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that this helped him in the management of the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Then this leader put even the founders of IBM in the shade - the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise is based on Watson&apos;s ideas till this day. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the enterprise till 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, began as already the name betrays, with the production and the distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese dressmaking, up to cashes. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In first four decades in which Watson led the company he doubled her turnovers on nine million dollars and the enterprise expanded bit by bit on all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat whole during forty years in the chief armchair, only then he was removed from his son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his management IBM started to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first computer language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 60s engineers and computers of IBM of the NASA flights helped in all to lead - to the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of the person to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, developed IBM in 1964 the first calculator family with the same calculator architecture - the row of IBM System / 360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> A classical PC which determined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150. </seg>
<seg id="373"> On the other hand, twenty years later disposed IBM his calculator production to the Chinese society of Lenovo, bought them, nevertheless, the adviser&apos;s part of the enterprise of PricewaterhouseCoopers and herewith got completely into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy which pays off IBM during the last three years is the draught &quot;smart planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It embodies the intention to use technologies in clever manner in areas planned not even up to now, e.g., also for the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the town management. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; which should help the traders to lead the whole commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM also has in Czechia a strong history. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Already in 1932 IBM founded an establishment in Czechoslovakia at that time - as the generally first country in Central Europe and East Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, among the rest, IBM ČR pursues also a strategical Outsourcing centre in Brünn. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for Central Europe and East Europe settle in Prague and here a top research team of international standing is also that deals with the technology of the vocal recognition. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Darina Rychtářová about her disloyal husband: </seg>
<seg id="382"> You can keep Iveta - this donkey to you, I do not want him any more! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is end! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After her spouse Josef Rychtá ř (53) of the protector of Iveta Barto š ová (45) had become their lover, Darina still remained hope that Josef awakes from his rose dream and comes home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But finally now it is over with the patience and for the other life it has put to herself clear rules. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Josef can come home, but no more than my partner&quot;, explained D. Rychtářová. </seg>
<seg id="387"> As a Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Barto š ová in her own house Shelter had offered, would not probably have occurred to her sometimes in the dream how with her man goes out. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When Iveta on her urging moved after 30 days again from and back after Říčany, Josef immediately went along. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Yes he confessed even publicly that he loves them. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With the time resigned Darina, it seemed even, as if it wants to be reconciled with her disloyal man again - now finally, however, she jilted him. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychytá ř makes no difference it with whom his woman sleeps </seg>
<seg id="392"> If, nevertheless, Rychtá ř Iveta Barto š ová should leave in future, he will not conceive at home certainly to open arms. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days at our common home, I will not chase out him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;However, not as beloved, lost old donkey, but as the person to whom I still have certain connections&quot; betrayed Mrs. Rychtářová; however, she also said, she has separated from him already emotionally and exists only on mutual Anständigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Josef carries the fact that to him Darina has bolted the back door up to now with dignity. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I respect the decision of my woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I stay together with Iveta, in it nothing changes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My woman wants a paper marriage and I respect this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="399"> &quot;The company goes on, I look after the repair, the garden, the property, I make the purchases.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="400"> &quot;I talk to Darina quite normally, we divide only the bed just not&quot;, said J. Rychtá ř (the sheet) Blesk. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If Darina wants to search itself new love, he does not want to hinder them in it. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;We do not sleep with each other, so makes no difference to me whether she has a friend or who is this. </seg>
<seg id="403"> To me it is clear that this is my guilt, I have fallen in love with Iveta and, therefore, I take over any responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst female bad habits: How does it stand with you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If one asks the men to call some typical female bad habits, then they shake without exception some promptly from the sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dear women, do you recognise yourselves in the following lines again in which we allow to pass a few bad habits revue again which allow to flow to the men the blood in the veins? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Shopping addiction </seg>
<seg id="408"> Does her husband accuse them of being addicted to purchase? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Must you buy to yourselves at least one quarrel weekly? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Do you go shopping with pleasure and may it be by actions also immediately a little bit more? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then it is in your case quite really about a weakness. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are aware of that at least and try to hold her shopping desire more or less under control. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But hand on the heart which woman already stands it to stroll in search of a well seated clothing only thus by a clothing shop and not to try out everybody (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin to themselves like? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women, for the men it is often the pure hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> If they consider, nevertheless, sometimes, how often they have already said her man - stay outside you sometimes rather... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant discontent </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;Am I not too thick?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I would have to take at least five kilos - should I start, jogging or making gymnastics?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;Do you like me generally?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Does this seem to them anyhow famously? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then you probably also belong to the women who are properly obsessedly of how they look. </seg>
<seg id="423"> That is long ago not that you should allow to go for yourselves, but many men react allergically to it if her woman cries constantly about her appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger gender agrees - with rising frequency of the discomfort the women are more and more unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and cleanness, firstly </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is a fight against windmills. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Windows clean, tiles and dust wipe, the tub scrub - and this at least twice per week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Do you complain with her partner because he tramples once again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, do you scold the children because the just scrubbed wash basin is filthy again and because the glass door in the sitting room cupboard again has fingerprints where, nevertheless, the site foremen give so much trouble? </seg>
<seg id="429"> Should you suffer from &quot;Devianz&quot; of such type, you should know that one may exaggerate nothing and the order and cleanness in the family life not come first. </seg>
<seg id="430"> At last this immoderate cleanness mania can also damage to the mutual relations and above all the rest in the family. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Stitch </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Dirty gym shorts come to the laundry basket.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;Want you to draw the old socks really tomorrow once more?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;One does not throw a wet towel simply on the floor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If your partner of such a tirade is put out, you may not surprise that him this drives mad. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Clear this is not meant badly, nevertheless, they want only, all that has his order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> If the men knew this, the women possibly did not need to grumble so much. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Clap and gossip </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women clap and gossip with pleasure, there are whispered behind the back or are slandered even or one forges alliances. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are simply focused on relations, therefore, they gossip with pleasure about such subjects, as for example - who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Probably each of us women has a little harmless clap and gossip on camp. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on the heart - this is probably own to all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> However, this is not to be mistaken for old gossips of the coarsest caliber to which nothing and nobody is holy who probably despise everybody in her surroundings and which show a considerable danger particularly for women&apos;s groups. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with her assistances to the victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The hockey forward Jaromír Jágr had with the Monday play of the NHL with two assistances big portion in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is through this again the most productive Czech player in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Beneficiary of the overview of the 39-year-old hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux who added one more assistance and was exclaimed to the best player of the match. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Player Jakub Voráček also registered Jágr&apos;s two assistances in the same play. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jágr stated after the play towards journalist, he has prophesied Giroux a big evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Already before the play says I him that he manages today a Hattrick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> I had this anyhow in the feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Every now and then a feeling overcomes such&quot;, explained Jágr after whose action Giroux already with the first shot of the flyer a gate achieved. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A little bit the second hit had later also &quot;a Czech track&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček won behind the gate of the Hurricanes the puck and presented him between the circles to successful Maxim Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> One second before the final whistle of the first third the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a Short-Hander, but then the second third belonged again of the flyer. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr he achieved his third hit, then steered Wayne Simmonds his shot to the fourth gate. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I do not want to say that he is the best player of the league, but certainly he belongs to the best three&quot;, appreciated Jágr his centre. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;To me would not have occurred in the life that I play together for the end of my career with such an ice hockey player, how with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;This pleases me tremendously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I cut my play on me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All years in the NHL put my players her play on me and now the spit turns round&quot;, smiled Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina made play still the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer which asserted itself from a penal shot, it approached on a gate. </seg>
<seg id="464"> However, weakly Read prevented every other complication in which he was successful in majority two against. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Excellently operated Pronger still in our zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He got the puck, I took up journey and (Read) moved to more distant posts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to meet him and am glad that it has worked&quot;, Voráček described the last hit of the part from his view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> By this victory Philadelphia sat down to the point of the eastern conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Š paček injured himself in the play against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens paid beside theirs experienced baker also for her guidance unlost in the penalty kick shooting 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomá š Plekanec could not transform one of the penal shots. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points hurt the trainer of the home team probably the high illness-conditioned failure in the defensive - they played the play only with five defenders to an end. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;This is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played the meeting only with one single experienced player to an end, the rest were young players.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there nothing can be made, we must finish this&quot;, said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;With every change an attack wave after the others and we had to oppose nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We would have the play easier must make and bring out the puck of our third.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> Here there were still reserves&quot;, meant P. K. Subban, one of the defenders. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec repulsed thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so decisively to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> In the gates of the jets which finished herewith a series of five defeats had five different protections Anteil. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of the travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Till 1989 there were in the ČSSR at that time only five allowed state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> At that time the travel agencies sold above all merely travelling in the socialist Eastern bloc countries, at that time in the west only chosen were allowed. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And thus Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German democratic republic - the GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula the Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary in the Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when one might also travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia shaped a prowestern course and, therefore, the trips were strongly limited to Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="486"> It was a big paradox of those socialist times that it was not even allowed to citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Tschechoslowaken) to travel freely within the scope of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel, for example, individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union, he needed in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not possible for individual travelling. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then the travel agencies also offered travelling in the west, then, however, one had to accept gigantic queues or also in the sleeping-bag before the travel agency spend the night, or at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency have. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Also so the thing had not still run long. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called. Foreign currency assent - the condition on a crossing the border in the west - was given only to &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others might not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The tschechoslowakische currency was because no freely exchangeable currency, without foreign currency assent it would have been impossible to unearth the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip in the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Hence, Czechs most from afar spent her vacation by the home, no miracle that the Czechs bought to themselves countless country houses and Datschen - a habit which continues till this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> A pilgrim&apos;s evolution of the Czechs followed the velvet revolution of 1989 the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While till 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs spent 4.5 millions her foreign holidays in countries of the whole world last year. </seg>
<seg id="495"> An immense paradox which one is not aware today at all is the fact that one could not travel in the holiday country most popular currently of the Czechs - Croatia till 1989 at all because it was a part of Yugoslavia at that time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Immediately from the beginning of the 90s of the last century in the foreign currency duty was lifted in the neighbouring west-European countries what caused an immense wave of short visits above all to Vienna in Austria and to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Tschechoslowaken could not get long time of her trips in the west simply enough, everybody wanted to have been there at least a few days. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Thus the Czech vacationers slept with travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at that time already the money for a lodging at the hotel or in a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> At that time a typical sign with foreign tours of Czechs was one with canned food, beer and hard smoked sausage etc. a full-packed boot. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important landmark was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could buy a place the western currency, finally, freely. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our life level and through this also the average salaries rose what flowed in 1997 into an other important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the raised inquiries for travelling the travel agencies after 1997 started to prepare regularly travelling by charter flights by which the flights thanks to the possibility to negotiate amount discounts in comparison to the past incredibly reduced in price. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the end of the 90s the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already payments without foreign currency with all sophisticated countries of the world had what went on the trip even easier. </seg>
<seg id="504"> At an other interesting moment in the history of the &quot;postal-velvet&quot; holiday traffic it came in 2000 when thanks to the high inquiry the first direct charter flight was dispatched in an exotic country - to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since that time direct charter airplanes with Czech passengers fly annually in far away sunny countries; this year one approaches directly from Czechia twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> To 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the epoch which marked our &quot;postal-revolutionary&quot; development came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On the 17th of November, 2008 the visa duty lifted the USA for Czech tourists by which our country joined definitively among the sophisticated countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of her vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in her history they gave for one single holiday stay including the costs at the holiday place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head from. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting should find a new chairperson - again threatens a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Already during nearly five months the Czech football has no chairperson and with the fact threatens that the successor to Ivan Ha š ek becomes not even known at the head of the Czech football association (FAČR) after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Till this day there is because still no arrangement on it after which electoral law should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without this no vote is possible generally more than three potential successors. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá š Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June ha š ek withdrew from his function and he his colleagues by the exit requested had to agree and to find a strong personality which can lead the football in future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the era after ha š ek the old quarrelling broke out between both association chambers once more which cannot agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This appeared plainly on the 16th of September when the new chairperson should be selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the general meeting had completely come free of charge to the national house in the Prague quarter Smíchov, because the negotiations led to no result and, besides it was not only about the choice itself. </seg>
<seg id="519"> One could not agree because sometimes on who is actually eligible to vote with the full collection - only the representatives according to statute or also the officials equipped with an authority. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this only point one achieved at least partial arrangement to what also the recommendation of the institute of state and right contributed whose opinion is not admissible after a representation on authority base. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Nevertheless, the disputes around the electoral law continue furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Also the executive committee did not bring any more clarity in the thing, with which meetings - all the same whether well-arranged or extraordinary - in principle, generally nothing else more is on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the views changed concerning the choice a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same one. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how should one go forward in the 3rd round to avoid a deadlock? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The contentious issue concerns the question whether one should go forward according to the statute, or whether quite an other model must be found&quot;, ascertained you š in Svoboda, one of three acting chairpersons of the FAČR who represents the professional football in the management. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to model according to statute wins in the third round that candidate who receives the bigger percentage support in the chamber for which he runs for election. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is supposedly ready to come on the compromise that that candidate wins who receives the higher voice number from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side insists again in the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority with this percentage vocal counting up. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Then both qualifying rounds have generally no more sense, this mode would question the whole bicameral draught&quot;, Svoboda understands the objections of the mährischen side which it would find best to choose the electoral law not hinzubiegen, but according to valid statute. </seg>
<seg id="530"> To him agrees astonishing-wise also Tomá š Paclík, even if becomes clear that the electoral law according to statute of all candidates meets soonest probably Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;It is my wish that as much as possible is chosen after the statute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that no senseless spare variations are devised, like at the last general meeting&quot;, explained the owner (soccer club) Victoria Plze ň who runs for election for the first time and differentiated himself in his statements above all compared with Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> However, Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to his opinion the new chairperson becomes known in Nymburk and he thinks that the candidates work together in the future also constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification of the national team for the Fußball-EM at the present day would certainly contribute to reassurance of the minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;If the football rides only on the euphoric wave, the readiness is also bigger to the cooperation&quot;, believes the official from Jablonec who brings from all three followers the biggest experiences and this at professional, as well as regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is reserved there. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope for an arrangement, but, unfortunately, the situation is ambivalent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is no thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts &quot;to bend into shape&quot; the regulations for own purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;Therefore, a renewed blocking is not excluded at the general meeting.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;Nevertheless, I hope that at last the healthy common sense wins&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - a lot of time to the agreement of all sides does not remain any more. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should happen supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals are generally complete up to the qualification play. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charter flight stuff with which, among the rest, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance at all and thus one looked feverishly for a spare variation how to bring a part of the executive committee, nevertheless, still to the venue of the cash rage&apos;s first leg one. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At last the meeting is nevertheless probably vital at cabinet level to which it should come supposedly on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobe š, the minister for school system, youth and body education would have moved the split parties within the biggest sports association of the country with pleasure to an arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It gets up because a lot: state allowances, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV which should show the new direction to the Czech sport after the finance problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the chairperson because he sees no suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If Tomá š Paclík, the boss of the Pilsner footballers could have put out a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled to all his images about the new chairperson of the football association of Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have got involved at all in the fight for this top position. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the choice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the present situation one did not succeed in finding such a follower&quot;, said Paclík ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The principal reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to be prevented it that of the supposed favorites of the choice, Pelta, to the point of the FAČR reaches. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that he thinks to exercise the function of the chairperson only one year, so till 2013, up to the appointment of the well-arranged general meeting in case of his victory. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of the chairperson he would have seen with pleasure an experienced top executive who is involved not too very much in the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;With some possible people I have spoken personally.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;To think hardly that some said me, they did not want to identify currently with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such views would have changed with pleasure&quot;, he stated. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Mostly from all Paclík disturbs supposedly the connection Pelta&apos;s with the chairperson of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, to a man with controversial call which is valid behind the scenery as a mighty lobbyist, with the ability of influencing delegate&apos;s votes at general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> That&apos;s why for Paclík it is unacceptable that Pelta would hold the position of the chairperson. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;In his victory would become the today&apos;s state einkonserviert and in the Czech football it would not lead the way at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, would agree to the football twice badly&quot;, stressed Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Herewith he also leads on the fact that Pelta&apos;s name fell some time ago in connection with phone hearings to the inquiry in a Korruptionsaffaire from which Pelta arose, nevertheless, with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know, which prestige a victory about Pelta to him (tsch). football should introduce.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how we would stand there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA&quot;, said řekl Paclík which his former remark, &quot;he will sell the Pilsner soccer club if Pelta of chairpersons becomes&quot;, sees, however, already a little more calm. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Should Paclík win in the Thursday choice, nevertheless, he can fancy a future cooperation with Pelta absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just also there thinks another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the general meeting in October had supported which ended with a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;It (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has big abilities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could fancy him well, for example, as a boss to the national team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But I do not think that he is able to lead the association as a manager.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I do not put my nose, nevertheless, in matters from which I understand nothing&quot;, said Paclík which had provided in September with it for sensation that he headed behind the recall of the referee&apos;s commission with Lu ďě K Macela for which Dagmar Damková substituted. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík itself states, he feels grown to the role of the association chairperson. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And, besides, appeals to his abilities with the management of private companies, since the last summer he is also a boss of Pilsen which celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To limit the influence of certain interest groups which tend to influence disciplinary commissions and appeal commissions what degenerates till disgusting situations&quot;, stated Paclík which makes no secret from his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta boss Daniel Křetínsk ý. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of his priorities he would look at the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia&apos;s committee with whose help he would become with the political leading politicians for it lobbyieren that more money from the lottery tax flows into the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the determining things to which the new chairperson should devote himself&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it comes for the taxation of luck plays as the political parties declare, then I understand her argumentation, then, however, they must also speak in no uncertain terms where the money goes&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> His connection with the Pilsner club does not look at Paclík also as a handicap, although he himself stresses, the chairperson of the FAČR must be &quot;nonparty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again with Jablonec form an alliance, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not quite ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;It makes to my opinion, however, also not a lot of sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritically on a third person to return again after one and a half years&quot;, clarified Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would exclude a deadlock in future. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the football association one of the candidates promised for the chairperson&apos;s office, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make himself strong in case of his choice for it that the FAČR gets new statutes which exclude in future disputes about the electoral law from the start. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign will certainly ease with a possible success of the Czech choice. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta had already promised before the not realised choice in September, he wants to concentrate in case of his choice upon the national team and the production of funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He resolved only on the last moment to take part at the choice before the last general meeting and thus the 2-month break might help him to defend his images about the management of the football and to introduce in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels devote themselves to the football, they are impatient and, hence, expect that the chairperson is known on Thursday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;He feels that it is high time that the association is escorted by somebody, believes the man who is connected above all with the Jablonecer club which operated, however, also many years with Sparta and in the executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also, therefore, he believes that he disposes of sufficient experiences to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is persuaded that the euphoria is responsible for the today&apos;s problems with the choice which ruled at times of Ivan Ha š ek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June statutes were approved which were not so perfect as it everybody had accepted. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had from September already a chairperson&quot;, believed Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> He used just the reworking of the most important document of the civil union as a lure for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;Should I become a chairperson, I take care of that personally and is to be carried ready personally responsibility if it does not work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be&quot;, states Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Subsequently he does not try to differentiate himself towards his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Before he had announced, he can fancy a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl which he recognises because of his juridical education and he well knows that his rival candidate would be his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Also Tomá š Paclík he did not attack for a long time any more which left no dry thread in Pelta again. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In the football he already moves about a year and can already refer to certain success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Nevertheless, his attacks were slighting and many people were shocked by his electoral campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;Now also, therefore, many doubt his real character&quot;, addressed Pelta to his opponent who remains loyal probably his Proklamierungen which have already expressed he in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> According to his opinion his strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football of the lowest play classes, up to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the signboard of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;I would also try to finish all Affairen - from the Causa Bohemians, up to reverberating the corruption scandal of the last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately afterwards I would rush at negotiations with the private and state sector to guarantee sufficient funds for the whole football&quot;, said the 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> At that time he also promised that his move will mean no personnel purges in the point of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would have to make myself close first of all with the working contents of all employees&quot;, he said in the direction of Strahov where on account of the long anarchy understandably nervousness rules. </seg>
<seg id="609"> In spite of dezeitigen to the katastrophischen scenarios which accompany the upcoming general meeting he thinks that the delegates do not go on Thursday free of charge to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If really the only debatable point should be as one chooses in the third round, then we get over it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;The football needs credibility and he thereby wins back that only if he has, finally, a new leader&quot;, Pelta two days before the possibly deciding day of his official&apos;s career remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts to work under him hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the present acting presiding Jindřich Rajchl at the general meeting should be chosen on Thursday the new chairperson of the football association of Czech Republic, this would spoil supposedly for many people in the association the mood. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises because that one starts to work in case of his choice hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce system changes and hold responsible the members of the executive committee on single football areas. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Moreover, he promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money in the football and to continue otherwise the work which previous presiding Ivan Ha š ek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As a chairperson I would like to devote myself to the football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, about the national choice, the professional football, up to the achievement football for the youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;With it I do not want to say that I want to make alone everything&quot;, said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and, hence, would like to distribute the competence in the executive committee in such a way that every member devotes himself to a certain area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will distribute hard duties, so that the football makes headway in every segment with mile steps.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> About that many would be delighted not exactly because she instead of criticising only the work more different now really hard start would have to to work&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement has taken into consideration not to run for election at all any more. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;By me is known that I work 20 hours on the day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who do not throw to me incessantly bat between the legs and every step which I take, question&quot;, he said as an explanation, why he has hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;However, many people said me that I may not surrender because it, otherwise, also others would act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;This is a trust which one may not gamble away&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Supposedly also motivates him to be allowed to continue the work which he has begun under ha š ek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;In two years we have mastered a big piece of work and now I simply do not want to throw away this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Processes were begun which are effective quite only in a few years and I would see only reluctantly that stop them somebody&quot;, he believed and expresses herewith his doubts, that to itself for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen who could return situation in the times before ha š ek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in systematic action and this is something what does not bring Mirek Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him stand above all people who would make the football in such a way that he would be there only for chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> One can probably accuse me of something, but not that I would be biased.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want football for everybody because it goes well then to all and not only the chosen&quot;, noted Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> He also contradicts the assertion, he is only one chairperson of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even if some people maintain the opposite, I really plan to do the best possible for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is to be considered time whether one should not divide the league into a Czech one and a mährischen part whose winners climbed up then in each case in the first league.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Then it could not happen that today only three mährische clubs play in the league what is a problem particularly for the young players in Moravia&quot;, believes Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomá š Paclík to the fight for the function of the chairperson has joined, does not dare Rajchl to estimate his chances that he is chosen. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber which has chosen me her acting chairperson and recognises now that clear success stands behind me&quot;, stated Rajchl which also looks at the saving of umpteen million crowns about unbecoming contracts, the arrangement of television contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, he puts on himself partly the blame for the fact that the association does not move in one single rope. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he says of Pelta, &quot;he would be disqualified from the start to help the Czech football to new trust&quot;, he holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has to offer something to the football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can question that he has performed in Pilsen in only one year of excellent work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;Should he be chosen, he would probably continue the things which Ivan Ha š ek has initiated and also he would not change the personnel occupation in the commissions obviously basically.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> He would not want the things certainly in his favours hinbiegen&quot;, judges Rajchl about his rival. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The nicest pools of Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> Jump in the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> Von Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Paddling pools in UFO optics, splendour pools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, his nasty surprise can experience - and rest the tired legs in mineral water baths after a town tour or a wandering. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book points where wellness is the nicest in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> If iris Meder went during the past one and a half years on search trip, might not be absent one in her luggage: her bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Backward recumbent on the water, she high awaited in skilfully formed domes, she swam marble putting which waited in the pelvic edge for them, and was astonished at meticulously restored Jugendstil swimming halls. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If she liked a bath, it took up it swiftly in her notebook - with worth knowing details about the construction method and history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 swimming-pools architecture historian Meder explored in this manner - and introduces them now in her just appeared book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: National swimming halls in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;hardcore concrete structures&quot; in the Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Through 13 countries she led her &quot;trip to the most unusual baths in Central Europe&quot;: Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast. </seg>
<seg id="658"> With sport she does not have a lot in the hat, says Meder - only in the water this is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Annoyingly only that swimming fans must resign themselves to blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling smell of spruce forests or listen in happy bird&apos;s twitter in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day I have asked myself, why swimming-pools must be so ugly, actually, always&quot;, says the Meder living in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started collecting nice baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> Water surface doubles architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> Geplätscher in the jump washbasin and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so big, therefore because all senses are served, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if have given themselves the builder trouble, swimming halls can be a true feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor one has in baths a water surface.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;She is transparent on the one hand, however, on the other hand, the beauty of the whole building reflects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything doubles optically: high vaults, coloured tiles, springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The compact illustrated book &quot;bath joys&quot; provides interesting facts about the architecture history and cultural history on 190 sides of historical wellness oases - however, above all desire for a jump makes in the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The pool collector Meder discovered noteworthy copies by her searches in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Beside splendid medicinal baths like the 100 year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest she found nitrate-containing waters in an earthy two-pronged mattock cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose washbasins are filled with alkali-containing water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> However, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the whole town in the eye of the Züricher roof bath, one can look in the outside pool of a bath in Saint Anton at the snowy mountain Arl - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the activity on the ski runway. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The maybe most unusual pool design expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> From three upwards open bowls it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals rise in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> Not in every swimming-pool the smell of chlorine rose to the pool collector Meder in the nose. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in Á rpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks it so strongly of fuel oil which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen healing water which is almost black and whose sludge to one sticks to the skin, as soon as one sinks in the washbasin - a wellness experience of the special kind. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Nevertheless, at a place iris Meder on her search for nice bath places was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit the free bath and solar bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it found a barred terrain. </seg>
<seg id="678"> In 1902 from the architect Du š in Jurkovic formed bath was closed, in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Meder had a look by the weather-beaten windows of the red-white-yellow Jugendstil building, she saw how weed grew rampant between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Has counteracted against the decay one, however, in an enchanting swimming-pool in the Black Forest: to the palace of Thermal in bath Wild bath. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This bath has three construction phases already behind itself; one can discover not only neoromanesque elements which come from times of his establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in the Alhambra style which was added about 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since the careful modernisation in 1995 is of the palaces of Thermal the favorite bath of the pool expert iris Meder - and this not only because she comes originally from the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It is already an achievement to melt thus different architectural styles to such a great unity&quot;, says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a secondary matter. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agrarian speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> The German bank allows to analyze raw material business </seg>
<seg id="687"> From Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Does the German bank give up her business with agrarian raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has asked a working group to check the results of the speculation for the arms of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Then in January the group boss wants to draw conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the German citizens the thing is clear: 84 percent of the Germans find according to a study not satisfactory that banks with agrarian raw materials speculate like wheat or maize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of the interviewees demand even that the German bank and other loan institutes get out of this business because it aggravates the problems of the poorest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa survey by order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report, the Foodwatch at the middle of October presented. </seg>
<seg id="696"> In it the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets force up the prices on the global raw material stock exchanges - and, therefore, the banks carry a partial responsibility in the worldwide hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the consumer custodians is directed specifically against German&apos;s bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks operate like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley alike. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally raw material bets were intended to secure trader against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> However, meanwhile agree most experts that the Zocker have decoupled themselves from offer and inquiry - and make at the expenses of the poorest profits. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Differently than the US competitors Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He promised to check the reproaches and said, no business is worth it &quot;to risk the good call of the German bank&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to the information of from SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group checks currently the reproaches from the Foodwatch report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Till the end of the year the check should be concluded, then the results are presented to the board of directors of the German bank - with recommendation, as should become with it handled. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Then at the end of January the point of the bank wants to inform which conclusions it draws. </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the end a reduction of the raw material business could stand, or even the complete turning away. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann does handicraft in his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, however, confirmed at the same time his criticism of the finance branch: &quot;The bets on rising prices of food show especially drastically how thoughtlessly banks damage today the public welfare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann stands as the uppermost bank lobbyist now particularly in the duty. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The German bank must stroke all arrangements from her port folio by which money is used for bets on food prices&quot;, said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;All the same whether it is for Mr. Ackermann about hunger suffering people or about the call of the German bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The examination of Ackermann comes at first sight unexpectedly, however, is clearly that the group boss would like to deliver a perfect picture few months before his departure from the office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday the German bank announced that the chief executive officer does not change differently than planned in the supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a turning away from the argumentative agrarian speculation he could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And he hardly needs to care about possible losses - his successor would deal, finally, with it. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every second would discontinue raw material arrangements </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch bemüht sich, Bastelraum Druck auf Bastelraum-Betriebsleiter hoch zu halten. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Up to now have already taken part more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the institute of Forsa has questioned on the 7th and 8th of November 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent hold it, therefore, for legitimate that offers the German bank arrangements with which is bet on prices of food. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions if they find out that her bank takes part in such shops: Every second would discontinue according to the survey all arrangements by which money flows into the raw material speculation. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 percent would advise friend against such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think, to discontinue her account and to change to another institute. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21st house in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> Der umgezogene Pavillon </seg>
<seg id="723"> From Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architecture history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels in 1958 gained prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood empty and neglected. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now he is reopened as an exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If is swarmed about modern post-war architecture, from clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials which are typically for the faith in the technical progress then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler world exhibition 1958 is a suitable and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> At that time swan&apos;s cerium pavilion got the Grand Prix d&apos;Architecture for his light and floating active steel glass construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is valid till this day as a landmark of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He announced the architect in such a way that also with the next world exhibition of Austria pavilion built. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW-four cylinder house plus bowl-like Nebenbau in Munich he became famous in 1973, finally, internationally. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His as a temporary exhibition construction planned pavilion one had put up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden with the Viennese south railway station, had done alterations and in 1962 had opened in it a museum of the 20th century - the &quot;20th house&quot; was called it. </seg>
<seg id="732"> However, the building was suited neither spatially and technically as a museum - no walls to the slope of the art, no good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless, it was used so long, until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building stood empty and came down more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has altered the pavilion, now he is called &quot;21st house&quot; and is used in future as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening the museum of Belvedere to which the house belongs opens there the first exhibition - a piece of luck in every regard. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Has put through the fresh start Agnes Husslein-Arco whom in 2007 new manager of the Austrian gallery of Belvedere became. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, conferred a doctorate art historian with substantial career among other things in the youth as an Eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby&apos;s, the home Guggen museum and as a foundation manager of the museum modern Salzburg, put through the rebuilding emphatically with politicians and preservationists, they procured public means and private sponsor&apos;s money and fixed the use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except present art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the endowment of the same name, there should be a café and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built in addition. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Then for the realisation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had altered Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitively and had extended and had won the competition, but because he has studied under swan&apos;s cerium at the University of Technology of Vienna and the pavilion for him a &quot;tremendously important place&quot; was at which he had had a look &quot;almost at every week-end&quot; the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the old draught, and he knew the problems of the building which already lost with his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung to generosity and ease. </seg>
<seg id="744"> With the current rebuilding there were far bigger problems: The building was &quot;an energy catapult&quot;, says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was substituted with special shatterproof glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Cold bridge steel bearers have been strengthened or been substituted, and asbestos-full covers were redeveloped. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements brought place for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, still the light swan&apos;s cerium-pavilion leads to the entrance a bridge - nearly one new building, but. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original outside doors have remained, the house is stroked in the old red-brown rust protection-tone. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the film hall still is certainly in such a way as he was former. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all that under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;A material had to be often found which is good and is cheap and also liked the conservation of monuments and historic buildings office&quot;, says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> In spite of all compulsions, problems and rebuildings the building is adaptable and has remained light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It has been difficult with the pavilion, &quot;from Brussels came along&quot;, has recently said Krischanitz, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> So an architecture stands &quot;always at the wrong place&quot; and wants to wake, nevertheless, &quot;a right consciousness&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> However, in this case the 21st house is not at the wrong place, because a town planning piece of luck has stamped in it: Round the Swiss garden originates just the &quot;central station accommodation&quot; planned absolutely anew, with office houses and dwelling houses. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another piece of luck will maybe still enter: The 21st house could get strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary arts centre, and how one hears, she already negotiates with the town around a nachbarschaftlichen location in the Swiss garden. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Road plans winter crisis package in millions </seg>
<seg id="758"> The road has worked out a contingency plan which should prevent train failures in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The employee&apos;s number should be doubled. </seg>
<seg id="760"> This costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the fight against winter-conditioned train failures and delays the German railways are economical according to a newspaper report this year more than 70 million euros, in addition. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper reported to begin with with reference to a group-internal contingency plan, till 2015 investments of a total of about 300 million euros are planned. </seg>
<seg id="763"> With it a better availability should be reached from vehicles and railway system also with extreme weather. </seg>
<seg id="764"> Among the rest, a doubling of the internal and external employees would be planned for the snowy removal on railway equipment and platforms on 16,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="765"> Aim is to release platforms up to the company beginning and 90 percent of the points necessary for company within from four to five hours from snow and ice. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Road boss Rüdiger Grube had warned about two months after a top meeting with government and industry before train failures and delays also in this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> In last winter the road in the passenger traffic had considerable problems, because she lacks, among the rest, with difficult weather conditions reserves. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Thus numerous new regional trains wait for many years for a licensing of the railway Federal Office. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Besides, there is a delay with the delivery of intercity express trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Of the road also gives a hard time for many years that it must check axes of intercity express trains clearly frequent in the workshop, after an intercity express had a broken axle in the Cologne central station. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German bank pays million punishment in the USA </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the tumult around boss Josef Ackermann comes new hardship from the USA: The German bank must pay there million coaches. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems were not at home for the German bank already enough, now still his past catches up the branch giant in the USA: The Frankfurt institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to add disputes because of the bankruptcy of five big loan banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It is about the sales of mortgage papers. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The Finanzmarktregulierer NCUA accuses a whole series in major banks of having tempted the loan banks with wrong promises into the purchase of the finance products; they would have run through the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such papers lost during the financial crisis hard to value and tore the banks with in the depth. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are contented that we could solve the subject, without the parties had to move in court&quot;, said a German&apos;s bank speaker in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank put away no guilt with the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This is also valid for the Citigroup which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="780"> NCUA chairperson Debbie Matz welcomed the obligingness of both monetary houses. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The Nationwide Credit union administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US loan banks and steps in with bankruptcies to protect the customer inserts. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA tries to get the resulted damages heavy to milliard substituted. </seg>
<seg id="783"> The compromises made now are first of her kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The Regulierer had also prebuttoned to themselves other major banks and in summer had sued JPMorgan Chase, which royal bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> With the doubtful mortgage papers it concerns so-called Mortgage-backed Securities. </seg>
<seg id="786"> House loans form the basis of these. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the US-real estate bubble burst in 2007, this one huge number of finance companies became the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-investment bank of Lehman Brothers tipped over. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Even if the events already date back some years, a sharp wind blows to the banks currently in the USA against. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and supervisory authorities have exerted countless complaints to receive reparation or to avenge misdemeanours. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The biggest complaint wave has released the Federal Housing Finance agency (FHFA). </seg>
<seg id="792"> She accuses 18 international major banks of having done down two state US-Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by mortgage shops in the volume of about 200 milliard dollars. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Also the German bank must position itself to a complaint of the FHFA, here it is about several shops to the value of a total of 14.2 milliard dollars from the years from 2005 to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="794"> The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters are responsible for &quot;essential losses&quot; without calling, however, an exact sum. </seg>
<seg id="795"> The German bank had rejected the demands as disoriented and had declared to want to defend itself. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Warren Buffett gets with 10 milliards in IBM </seg>
<seg id="797"> Finance guru Buffett invests hard in the IT enterprise IBM. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Since March he has bought up shares to the value of more than ten milliard dollars. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Up to now the big American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer enterprise, because the long-term development of the companies can be forecast only badly. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Now, nevertheless, he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his opinion about investments in the branch. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He had to understand already much earlier that IBM offers above all services and procures computer systems of the IT departments of other enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment of Warren Buffett is valid as a knight&apos;s blow in the financial world. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Now therefore the IT primary rocks IBM may be called &quot;sir IBM&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Since now Buffett revealed in the US-economic transmitter CNBC that he has bought IBM shares to the value of 10.7 milliard dollars since March. </seg>
<seg id="805"> His investment holding company of Berkshire Hathaway has climbed up with it to one of the biggest stockholders of IBM with a portion of 5.5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Buffett said that IBM has not even known up to now somewhat about the engagement. </seg>
<seg id="807"> He praised the management which itself had provided in the economic crisis still for well-arranged profits. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;You have made a great job&quot;, said Buffett to the strategy. </seg>
<seg id="809"> IBM places for some time on the lucrative IT services like the company of computer centres. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The more than 100 year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultation as well as highly competitive company calculators. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett had rather avoided technology companies to date. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He says, he invests only in enterprise whose business he also understands. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Instead, Buffett accessed possibly with a cargo railway, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders. </seg>
<seg id="814"> His holding company of Berkshire Hathaway owns beside about 80 own daughter&apos;s companies also shares in a whole series of great groups like Coca Cola or the Munich Re, the former inhabitants of Munich Moving. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and had developed them with clever investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Still is his life style give. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Therefore, it is for countless investors all over the world a cult figure. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost infallible sense for moneymaking oracle of Omaha&quot; has introduced in him the nickname &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After becoming known of the Buffett investment the IBM share vorbörslich rose by 1 percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is also called, is worth on the stock exchange all together more than 220 milliard dollars and counts with it together with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technology enterprises of the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> However, in Microsoft, so said Buffett, he does not want to get. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Founder Bill Gates is a narrow friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The menace is handy </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the disclosure of the &quot;Zwickauer of cell&quot; Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper speaks ferment from a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; which revives now. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight Turkish-born and a Greek small enterpriser in the years from 2000 to 2006 had a background of the extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="827"> To this news it is reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Since for many German Turks one longest ghost presumed dead returns with it: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November, 1992 and in Solingen in May, 1993 there has been no comparable power with background of the extreme right more against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> The fact that there is hostility to foreigners in Germany, never stood, nevertheless, in question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Nevertheless, the uncovered network of the extreme right reveals magnitude whose dimension is not still foreseeable long ago. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Does the bloody ideology revive again?&quot; headlined the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, however, stresses that one of the culprits a V man of the protection of the constitution should have been, and is concerned that also German authorities could be involved in the radical right-wing marsh. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Sensibly there reacted the Turkish municipality of Germany: She reminded on the week-end with a Mahnwache before the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist power. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks before the Turkish municipality had thought in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens. </seg>
<seg id="835"> In happy colours the cooperation had been produced - as a history of the success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Like a box on the ears the reporting of some of the Turkish media works there: &quot;Present of Germany to the fiftieth&quot; the heading of an article is in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot; which reports the backgrounds of the murder series. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the Germany issue of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; insists it on pulling this mental connection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It catches in to stink&quot;, the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci is called. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He stresses in the fact that people have been murdered who would have paid taxes and would have made with her work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Extremely critically the action of the police and their late search success is discussed in German Turkish Internet forums. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it has not rather occurred to the German authorities already a lot to look in circles of the extreme right for suspects, the authors surprise. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some one is at least rhetorically to drastic means ready: &quot;It is sloppy here furthermore, nothing else is left to the migrants than the self-defence and the arming&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;This will probably be the best self protection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;The internal peace depends very strongly on the goodness of the clarification and propriety of the punishment of the whole network in Germany&quot;, writes &quot;selenium&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What means it if the internal peace is in danger in Germany, the posters of Mölln and Solingen made clear in the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Since no other event showed the Turk living here more clearly that there is a handy menace, and the German that mistrust and distance can flow into rightwing violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Nevertheless, the posters sharpened the we-feeling on Turkish side. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The mistakes of the past do not repeat </seg>
<seg id="850"> At that time in the Turkish press above all the failure of the German politics was criticised after the posters: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the arson attack of Solingen he sent a telegramme of condolence to the Turkish president, can be represented on the memorial service in Cologne, however, by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - at that time Kinkel enumerated in his speech how many deliveries performed the local Turks. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Completely in such a way as if the value of a person calculates itself after the height of his tax deliveries. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The present reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the local rule of law since that time. </seg>
<seg id="854"> This time beside the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of the radically right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The scandal bank of the Zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS went in the financial crisis almost bankrupt and slides since that time from a crisis into the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now a German should direct it. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Thus it had not thought to themselves Axel Weber certainly. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure of the point of the Central Bank had become known in July that he would start in 2013 a nearly as spectacular new job: Administrative council president of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was glad publicly, praised Switzerland on account of her beauty and the UBS on account of her solidity won anew and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS has created the Turnaround&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I am glad about the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> However, already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of the UBS in London had avoided all protection systems of the bank and about 1.7 milliard euros verzockt. </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS chief executive officer Oswald Grübel, one not only in Switzerland of praised bankers, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The administrative council president of the UBS is valid since then also as groggy - and everybody asks: When does Axel Weber come, finally? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already became known that weaver may discuss the bank from February, 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And he does not take the administrative council chair already in May - only in 2013 as the bank informed on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber this becomes hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> He is no banker, rather economy professor and mark banker and would have needed a settling-in period absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Then with a blow he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that she earns long ago the title &quot;the biggest scandal bank of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Since the UBS is gigantic on the one hand - till recently she was the biggest property administrator of the world - and slides, on the other hand, for many years from a scandal into the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, so it seems, remains saved to the so proud Swiss bank once. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It began in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Till 2007 had the UBS an excellent call. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image hidden and respectable, but also ausgebufften Swiss property administrator had combined them with ambitious sighting: It also wanted to become in the Investmentbanking quite a big number. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Thus the UBS 2007 administered on the one hand dollar of more money of wealthy customers than any other bank of the world with 1.6 billions. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And, on the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank on the league of the biggest banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: &quot;I have put my student the UBS at that time always as a pattern of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s view one asks himself: How could I wander only so?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong immensely. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 became for the first time obvious that a little bit severely went wrong in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> At the middle of the year chief executive officer Peter Wuffli withdrew unexpectedly who was valid till then as a highly intellectual and as brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later one anticipated, why he had gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment section of the bank had itself with Subprime papers verzockt and had to copy milliards. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To shoulder this, an increase of capital announced the UBS at the rate of would you believe 13 milliard fr. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For it she really found investors, indeed which about whom some would have to the still nose shortly before gerümpft: an intransparenten Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arabian state fund which was so hidden that one not even found out his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> However, this was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April, 2008 it came more badly. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to announce new milliard losses, administrative council president Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still in the second-best paid-up administrative council of Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October, 2008 followed the disaster: The UBS stood in view of her bad investments in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought of the UBS for umpteen milliards problematic securities, the Swiss confederation gave six milliard fr for a compulsive change loan about which she could become a co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Whole Switzerland was shaken - then she noted how dramatic it is for a small country if it accommodates so big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the balance sheet total was the UBS 2007 more than five times more largely than the economic achievement of Switzerland (see graphics). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again we could not save the UBS&quot;, says bank researcher violinist. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The second one joined the first disaster. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already few months ago capitulated the UBS in the tax quarrel with America and agreed to publish the data of wealthy customers who had evaded taxes possibly with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Besides, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unwarranted profits from these shops with penal impact. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With it confessed the UBS more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something which had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureole of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy was not any more the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> There followed the resignation of chief executive officer and administrative council president. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customer money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus the bank within less months had lost her credibility in both central business divisions: in the Investmentbanking by the false speculations and in the administration of property by the help to the tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And even as it became a little quieter again, even as one thought, now it will do the UBS again, there follows this unblessed trader&apos;s history: A single trader verzockt 1.7 milliard euros, before the bank notices that something goes wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it becomes obvious: With the risk management in the Investmentbanking it does not work obviously yet. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli one had to find out that the risk control has changed not enough&quot;, says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor in the banking undertaking of the university of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also the finance board of directors of a big German bank is sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risk control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> Nevertheless, besides, it had been exactly the idea of the care with which the Swiss bankers had lined up long ago to become guardians of the big property of the world: no much too big risks, for it security for money - the world might also break down beyond the Alpine republic sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The safe deposits of the Swiss banks had become the symbol for steadfast reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit to the stereotype of the good-quality Swiss private bank - she is bigger only a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classical. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has her head office in Züricher Bahnhofstrasse which leads from the central station directly to the Zurich lake, from the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains frames becomes. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are magnificent, the store rents belong to highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> One finds jewellers like Tiffany&apos;s here between Swiss traditional shops like the cake shop Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Since centuries here reside the Swiss banks: from the national bank about the palace of the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks like Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> One enters the reception hall of the UBS by a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are marble-dressed up, before it thick leather armchairs, beside the bank logo a big sign stand to the &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer searches here: Security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, have edged out this idea of the Swiss bank sometime - or have betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would not like to read his name rather in the newspaper, finally, he makes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both major banks deals. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become too big a lot, he thinks - above all in the Investmentbanking where, besides, Anglo-Saxons would have spread out. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss would have to say there nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if, nevertheless, they have adapted themselves long ago to the customs of Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Really it was the anglo-saxon Investmentbanking which changed the UBS, her only high profits gave and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost so much money like the Swiss major bank in the Subprime jungle. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On the 15th of October, 2008 the disaster became visible. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small 7 million country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of her nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 milliard fr or about 45 milliard euros the politicians granted to save the major bank standing before the bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could it come in addition? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June, 1998 two three Swiss major banks united to an immense group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> There originated a bank which was already too big with the coalescence for small Switzerland - and on and on grew. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Helped in the fact that both different precursor&apos;s banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich, but sleepy bank with the main focus Administration of property in Zurich and a poorer, but already stronger made international. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly the made international investment bankers came favourably in a lot of money with which they could turn a gigantic wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are with this rise of the UBS form an alliance: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 group boss of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairperson of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team&quot;, says bank researcher Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the high-level intellectual, modest who understands a lot from models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly person who has worked way up from the bank traineeship to completely on top.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel has counted in the end on Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli has made at the end probably a determining mistake: &quot;He thought, his models are the reality&quot;, says violinist. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragically, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: High spirits came before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of the UBS clearly remember the executive&apos;s meetings on which group boss Wuffli over and over again spent the same slogan: Goldman Sachs of the throne bump. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the mightiest investment bank of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She stated &quot;League Tables&quot;, the ranking lists which documented the success of the banks of that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> There wanted the UBS, after completely on top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps had already succeeded to her. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign currency business and in share trade she completely joined in on top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Nevertheless, the management consultants who were instructed emphasised a weakness: In the international interest business, in the Bankersprache &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there is an immense distance to the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has gaps with American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, proceeded UBS in an adventure which it cost almost the existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry after growth, invested the bank as well as a Hedgefonds founded before her in American Subprime arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="955"> She developed to an immense machine which packed securities on American mortgage loans and handed on - however, besides, kept also even risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Still when other banks searched long ago the climbing out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Still in summer, 2007 when the American property market was aflame, has bought the UBS there&quot;, says bank expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after the other had to go, than to clear up the attempts more difficultly fell out than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts with the UBS became the catapult seat and are ramshackle till this day. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the major bank now, has a nearly impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for a bank to which all obvious commercial models have got lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bank researcher violinist already has an idea: End with the Investmentbanking, concentration on the administration of property, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Though completely so far the bank (still) does not want to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the Investmentbanking should shrink hard, now so much is quite clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> On the next Thursday the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce his future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 year-old Italo Swiss was intended, actually, only as an interim solution, as the bank separated unexpectedly from predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile he has asserted himself: He should carry on permanently the business of the UBS, informed the Züricher bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to drive back the investment bank on the state in the middle of the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="970"> In 3500 he strokes places. </seg>
<seg id="971"> However, this will not reach. </seg>
<seg id="972"> A vision needs the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With which wants she to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions which Axel Weber already puts himself certainly now. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he says up to now only, he will search a flat in Zurich for himself with his wife first of all. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Fear of recession in Europe loads US stock exchange </seg>
<seg id="979"> The menacing recession in Europe has taken the courage from the US investors to the weekly prelude. </seg>
<seg id="980"> The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without weight of punch. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the germ. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The general relief about the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not assert itself. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The euro fell compared with the dollar. </seg>
<seg id="984"> The Italian and Greek glass has been valid last week still as half-filled, however, not as half-empty - now the problems crowded again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Above all finance values stood on the sales slips of paper. </seg>
<seg id="986"> The Dow Jones index of the defaults took down to the commercial end at a deficit about 0.6 percent with 12.078 points. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In the commercial course the market barometre oscillated between 12.027 and 12,170 points. </seg>
<seg id="988"> The broader calm S&amp;P 500 indexes closed with 1251 points, a deficit of 1 percent. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The index of the technology stock exchange of Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went with 2657 points from trade. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In Frankfurt Dax with a deficit said goodbye to 1.2 percent with 5985 counters. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The industry in 17 euro-countries has clearly reduced her production and appears to the end of the impetus. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The enterprises produced two percent less here than in the previous month in September as the statistics office Eurostat informed. </seg>
<seg id="993"> This tuned the US investors doubtfully: &quot;We are no island, but dependent&quot;, said Steve Goldman of Goldman management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe will be able to escape so fast not from a recession, besides, there are other signs of the weakness at the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this care only: It is not clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end of the crisis, he said during a CNBC interview. </seg>
<seg id="996"> So it is too early from his view to invest in European state loans or banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead, Buffett threw one decades of old principle about the heap and got into the US-technology branch. </seg>
<seg id="998"> His investment about more than ten milliard dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and allowed to take down him against the trend in the commercial course at first just 1 percent higher. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The paper closed nearly consistently with 187.35 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Buffett has paid on an average 170 dollars piece according to own information and now holds 5.5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Share certificates of the bank of America gave way with 2.6 percent clearly stronger than the market. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> The house silvers almost the whole rest of his shares in China Construction bank and fills for it 6.6 milliard dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> The institute wants to follow with the clear profit from the business above all his capital rate aufpolstern and with it to harder regulation default. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The airplane farmer Boeing increased and limited with it the losses in the Dow. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> The share won 1.5 percent, after the group had collected the biggest order of his history. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Airline of emirate ordered 50 long distance machines of the type 777 on Sunday and numbered the value of the order at 18 milliard dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> Including from options on 20 other machines the volume amounts even to 26 milliard dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> In New York floor Exchange about 710 million shares changed the owner. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> 719 values increased, in 2281 gave way and 79 remained unchanged. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> In the Nasdaq closed with turnovers of 1.38 milliard shares 630 in the plus, in 1913 in the deficit and 82 consistently. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Intelligent crows spread out in towns </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places rooks are valid as &quot;problem birds&quot;: However, from the towns the highly intelligent animals cannot be expelled long ago any more, state experts. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> One they may, the others would like to get rid of them quite fast: Crows belong since centuries to the townscape, however, in many local authority districts local resident&apos;s discomfort upon mud and noise of the animals piles up. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Besides, means are against the &quot;problem birds&quot; up to now not by view. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Rooks are not to be got from the towns any more out, said experts with the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Blank. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> There experts from the whole federal territory consulted on possible ways out. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They search alternatives in the towns </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Besides, conservationists led back the problems in towns also on the migration from the land of the particularly protected rooks: The chemical application in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional living spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> The hunt, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical brood trees made the life difficult to the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows stand under nature conservation. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are big colonies with more than 600 brood pairs, among the rest, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among the rest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Empty. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> There an argumentative project had provided in 2005 to the plentiful homicide of crows in the administrative district for negative headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics had called the catch of the animals in bird&apos;s traps and killing with bats especially crude. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;The normal expulsion, the Vergrämen, brings nothing&quot;, has found out the town and scenery planner Werner Klöver from Blank. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Nests with water road sputter or trees fell, often has undesirable results, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wurttemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals make way, big colonies split themselves and spread at other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Vergrämung is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, old people&apos;s homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We have to leave with them live, we do not get them any more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Without environs the problem cannot be solved in the towns, believed mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Blank. </seg>

<seg id="1267"> &quot;Beauty and fright&quot; almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girl and botanists up to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance driver and clerks. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some will go crazy to prisoners of war, lose limb mass, or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Each of these lives flickers like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come, while to others go out. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Englunds book deviates from the usual history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Moreover, it corrects the image, the First World War has been only the disastrous position war in the west front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;Beauty and fright&quot; walks with expert&apos;s look above other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is almost from the outset a moving book. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war floods the life of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina who smells of Kordit. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Fancy, you are a woman who is with her children at home, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you remain or do you take the flight? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who comes generally? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly somebody understands what is passed or why this war is waged generally. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Missing facts&quot;, so Englund ascertains, &quot;were done up with supposition, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;Beauty and fright&quot; follows single people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories were taken primarily recollections, letters and other already published material. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Their life reports can be frightening or affecting, however, they are extremely alive in Englunds of the moments small in detail moulting aggregation. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them act from lack and Manage. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the history of a German school girl he tells: &quot;Substitute, everywhere substitute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, wrong rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He tells more about spare food in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes &quot;meat which was made from pressed rice and was baked in wether fat (and at last with a wrong bone of wood it was served), tobacco which was made from dry roots and dry potato skin, shoes which were soled with wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There was how he takes down, &quot;837 registered food substitutes which were permitted during the production by small sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories are about honour and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognises his own urge to the wildness and says about the war: &quot;One feels that in spite of all this is what was planned rather for men than to sit in the easy chair, to act with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and thus as if such a facade means civilisation and as if there was no barbarity behind own strengthened and fitted shirt breast.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Vice versa a British soldier recognises that he presumably die and nobody of it take notice or will look after it. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If one refrains from the thought to sacrifice itself, one would like to think that this happens before an audience&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead of this it is as awful as &quot;a convicted man who was hung secretly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations act from old Europe, this breaks up, and about new kinds of the terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict became increasing to an economic competition&quot;, writes Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He catches the arrival of that what he calls &quot;new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century&quot;: &quot;the word skilful and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit which slaughters, while he sits behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behaviour like heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Englund discusses the soldiers who tried actively to be infected with a prostitute with a gender illness to escape from the field service. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The absurd expression of that can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken pus, because soldiers shopped and smeared themselves on her genitals, in hope to come thus to the hospital&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those which had really despaired rubbed him in the eyes what led to the fact that they were blind the rest of her life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves Englunds poetry becomes smooth and, nevertheless, unobstrusively and adapts itself perfectly to his human job. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes he catches the way as the war &quot;in unique manner provoked uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The people start to ask themselves, why her leaders bring them to the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War were most rather distortedly like Paul Fussells &quot;Great Being and Modern Memory&quot; or novels like Erich Maria Remarques &quot;in the west nothing new&quot; as extensive history books. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Englunds tape joins to an unconventional fame hall. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has the most disastrous end from which I have read in a non-fiction book. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do not give it any more. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had snatched away from us with his book this side with the central figures before the nose and would have lighted with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After an early lapse a meticulously planned infringement </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved in it, some of them deceive application helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> One had decided on the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time hardly people are a park in the Zucotti. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret and only few high-ranking officials were informed. In the beginning all the others believed to take part in a practise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Chief constable Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation of full challenges was. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> The incidents of the past weeks like using of pepper spray against protesters what offends against the rules of the department and got the squatters a huge increase in public sympathies might not recur any more. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And thus the police action was carried out for removing the protesters from the Zuccotti park after two weeks of the planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Employ these had prepared, while they observed how occupations were used in other towns. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A disaster practise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Employ reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to the terrorism fight what also the quick transferring of a big number of police officers counts to - to concentrate upon Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training unity took place Monday night on the Manhattan page of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The order, in the park to enter, came &quot;at the last minute&quot;, said somebody whom with him order is familiar what Deklarierung spoke as &quot;a practise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;Few policemen who were incorporated of my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zuccotti park&quot;, said somebody who would like to remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones which knew that it were about the Zuccotti park were the high-ranking officials of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> A reason for the secrecy was a lesson which had learnt the town. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On the 14th of October officials wanted to remove the park, then, however, stepped back, as hundreds of protesters gathered, after these of these plans had got to know. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Employ of different sheriff&apos;s departments were involved in the operation of Tuesday, among the rest, also task forces from the whole town - groups of one hundred of the mobile officials who are ordinarily used in highly criminal neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people come and go out in the park, almost like commuter, so that 1 o&apos;clock is at night a good time to go in. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was measured to do this if the slightest number of people stays in the park&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure in the spades briefs and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan bridge. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lamps and the news taped to begin with which roared from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> When the public officials penetrated in her light blue windcheaters into the park, many protesters simply bundled together her things and left the place. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> The police said that till 1:45 o&apos;clock no tents were touched to give time to the protesters, to pack up her Having and Well. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the surroundings to intervene, arrests should become necessary in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters were made leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, speaker of the chief constable, said, this has happened to their own security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists state that one wanted to keep them from observing the police actions in the park. And they said, the contact of the officials has been very rough. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that television carriages could have taken photos in the Church Street on the west side of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> When the police in the direction of the west by the big mess in personal things of the protesters, under other suitcase, art lawns and bags with clothes, moved, followed her employee of the town cleaning which lifted what had been left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outward. From this pictures appeared quite short time later on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A main core of protesters covered near the culinary area of the camp in the centre of the park position. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some established barriers and the police continued her methodical arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Approximately 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together themselves in her arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Employ of the emergency services were called, around them loszuschneiden. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out till approx. 3:30 o&apos;clock in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The clearing was concluded after statements of the police after 75 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> For most arrests it came as he said, on account of &quot;unseemly behaviour and opposition against an arrest&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the boss of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, departmental boss of the detectives, also was there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> In spite of his presence Mr. Kelly did not &quot;lead&quot; &quot;the operation&quot; as Mr. Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> For the case that they should access the second group of officials waited on the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> In the Cortlandt Street, to a street block to the north of the park, and in the Pine Street, to a block further to the south, barricades were established. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It could be observed how from these locations the police expanded the vicinity on and on around the Zuccotti park around. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At a place it was observed, like several officials, many of them with shields, people outward floated. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Approximately 28 people were in the northern vicinity. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> About 5 o&apos;clock a protester on the roof of a police vehicle jumped to the south of the Pine Street and other demonstrators left the air from the tyre of a police coach. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At a place the amount threw a piece of plywood. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end an official and a protester came to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Trade union of the responsible persons will lodge complaint against the town because of dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The trade union, the hundreds of school responsible persons, the last month her job have lost, represents, plans to sue the town on Wednesday, because the dismissals inform on account of her immoderate influence on the schools, the poor students, are not necessary and discriminating. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The complaint is probably the last possibility, which to cancel of the trade union, district advice 37, in her efforts, the dismissals, is still open. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> 672 school assistants, care co-ordinators and other employees who belonged to the most badly paid-up employees of the town and had lost on the 7th of October in a manoeuvre her work the trade union leader as a political revenge for the fact have described that one had refused last year of the town the access to a health ground which the working groups maintained with which the budgetary gap should be closed. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> This accusation were categorically rejected by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> On a hearing of the town council said Dennis M. Walcott, manager of the schools, last month, the dismissals have been a part of the budget that one has dismissed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the town council shot back and explained to him that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school help would be dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Employ of the town council 37 said, they would have and warned the ministry of education about a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which submitting the complaint is announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The complaint will perform Mr. Walcott and the ministry of education of the town as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as a plaintiff who are all coloured or Latin-American women, like most of the assistants which have lost her work. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the town, said, the complaint would not be given to the town and therefore cannot be commented to their single assertions. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a complaint draught which is given to the New York Times the trade union has concentrated upon the number of the dismissals at the schools in the slums of the town to support a complaint because of unequal treatment. She states that poor schools had lost more assistants, because they are underfinanced chronically. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> She demonstrates that, while there were no dismissals on Staten Iceland and only few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants have lost in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> With the statement of the loss of five of eight school assistants who were done in the public school 36 in Harlem where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint means: &quot;This is no neighborhood of well-to-do parents who can organise donations to catch budget shortenings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was shortened this year by 3.26 percent. Moreover, money got lost when the town changed her calculation method for the extra financing for every arm school registration. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> Moreover, the trade union deplores that the leaders of the High Schools were escorted by the language in a memo in Crazy which approved the dismissal of the care co-ordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the English word &quot;excess&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;excess&quot; (in German: transfer) in the USA usually the change of a teacher of the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers describes who are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;66 care co-ordinators were dismissed, not transferred&quot;, says the complaint draught. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission finishes, congress ready, come to an agreement concerning Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> At last it looks in such a way as if Republicans and democrats were in Washington already to come to an agreement concerning the uprisings in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Everything what was necessary moreover was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the ending of the American interference. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday the committee for international relations of the senate decides a resolution which is subordinate to the chairperson John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) and one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US-American troops for her &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun with the reconstruction of her country&quot;, said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is a confirmation of the support of her democratic efforts by two parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound innocent, however, up to now nothing was easy in the Libya debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words of a row of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the USA in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law was turned down in the senate by a wide edge group of both parties and it came for no vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> However, on the same day this law fell through in the senate. Moreover, the chamber outvoted a decision to the shortening of the money for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The US mission thereby got in a sort of legislative purgatory - with a congress which was though angrily enough to criticise Obama&apos;s approach within the scope of the mission, but to pull away the ground under the feet not furiously enough, in order to him finally. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then the indecision of the congress was overtaken by the events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripolis fiel im August unter Bastelraum libyschen Rebellen und Gaddafi wurde sind 20. Oktober getötet. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The Nato mission ended officially on the 31st of October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the senate is maybe ready for the action. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the committee for international relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya on her huge courage and her unusual perseverance in her selffreeing&quot; and &quot;praise the men and women of the US-American military and her coalition partners who support the military operations for the protection of the people in Libya for her unusual courage and her professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Moreover, the resolution confirms &quot;the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable crossing of Libya to the democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Will the new measures receive the full support by the committee for foreign relations or will split them the legislators, how has it done the law from June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The last version bumps into the opposition of senator&apos;s Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), to the top Republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars speaker said on Monday that he has not seen up to now the final version of the new law yet. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to Capitol it lies in the senate to vote this week about a constitutional change which demands a well-balanced household, a top priority in nearly every congressional legislative period of the Republicans and some democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the management of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the household or another area which comes at the moment for the vote in the senate or congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have tried up to now unsuccessfully to bring her changes to the vote, although they have tried it often enough. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes which were presented to this congress and enclose a whole range of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are double - the same law was presented to the congress as well as the senate - others deviate only easily of each other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are only in the senate at least 15 versions of the balance household change and an other dozen, the &quot;federal expenses control&quot; would become. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are also identical, but they give to her principals - in particular beginner with the Republicans who want to polish up her curriculum vitae - to boast the possibility of the fact that they have &quot;written&quot; such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The budgetary controlling law which was dismissed in August requires that tune senate as well as congress about a change of the budgetary balance. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March 58 senators have been right for a not binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> After the household some members want to limit the number of the regulations which members of the congress can present, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation on two office times of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has suggested a row of changes which guarantee, among the rest, the right on a good education and hygiene. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> A change which forbids a marriage among same-sexual is just as a change which prohibits the combustion of flags, an always returning presentation. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Moreover, some legislators want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states these decline. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So keenly, as the members suggest changes, so far faster they move like during the past years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th congress legislators 77 such changes presented. in the 110th congress 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The tempo grows pale in comparison to that of the early 1990s years in which members regularly more than 150 changes suggested every two years, according to the figures which the senate library makes available. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> However, they were not much also more successful than the today&apos;s ones. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change which is to be added - 27. - it was ratified in 1992, however, it was suggested really already in 1789 to the congress. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Grievedly, but does not defeat&quot;, according to Giffords during the first television interview after the attempt </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months, after an armed man from the next distance had shot during an election rally in Tucson at them, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening appeared on the national television. She sang alone to the Broadway piece &quot;The Sun wanting Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said, the wish to recover is bigger than him to return in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the atomic, biological and chemical news &quot;20/20&quot;, she struggled according to words and needed help with the walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The broadcasting showed the heavy slow rest of the damage which the ball which has divided her skull, has pierced the left side of her brain and her head has crossed from the front to behind, has arranged. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago she returned unexpectedly in the congress to give triumphing her vote to the debt brake. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> During her first television interview after the attempt in January with which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked them how she feels, Gifford (41) answered: &quot;Quite well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was a part of one-hour &quot;20/20&quot;-Specials which was taped shortly before the publication of the new book of the married couple: &quot;Gabby: A history about courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special pursues Giffords recovery since the attempt from the 8th of January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In the videos which Kelly had taped in the first weeks one sees them in the hospital bed, with bald shaven head and a long scarf about the forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can lift only one or two fingers if her husband encourages them in addition. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later Giffords sits in a wheel chair, while therapists show her how she explains easy movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod with the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Ein Zucken mit Dem. Lippen. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first words: &quot;What&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After few days Giffords whispers another word: &quot;Toast&quot;. She would want that her breakfast is changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos which are played during the atomic, biological and chemical show show that music played an important role in Giffords&apos; recovery: One sees how the congressman sings Girls Precisely Wanna Have fun&quot; and to Tom Pettys &quot;Free Fallin&quot;&quot; together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview with Sawyer said Giffords which spends daily two hours with therapy that she cannot remember the day of the attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Their husband said that he had read out on the 12th of March an article of a newspaper about the attempt Giffords when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for six people who had been killed during the attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Supposed shooter Jared Lee Loughner serves a sentence in a prison in Missouri and is treated by force medically, while he waits for his negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people have died&quot;, told Giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of the recovery of his wife, so told Kelly Sawyer, she said: &quot;I was met.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;, I would say: &quot;Gabby, you were not defeated&quot;? &quot;, said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You were only met. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you will get through this and you will recover and you will stronger come back than one day before. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel rather compassion than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street gala dress which collected millions of dollar of homeless ex-servicemen in New York city. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> On a headword hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine gathered round him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The amount in black dinner jackets got up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes&quot;, said David Saltzman who organised the donation action in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A high-ranking military officer on the gala dress who was observed, among the rest, by the stick boss and chairpersons at that time, admiral Mike to garden peats saw the role of the troops different. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;You were introduced like orphan&apos;s children&quot;, wrote the officer in e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure, the organizers have it well-intentioned. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know this. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it was no respect, really not. It was a compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The crass contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy respect between the military and the mostly reserved, sometimes admiring American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops are showered with praise for her victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has his price, say official member. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public behaves increasingly in such a way as if she was sorry the people in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We were by no means victims&quot;, said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But apparently is the only way of the support that is to press us in the role of unhappy souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear thanklessly or in the quarrel with the public which they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also they have recognised that the fury, the returning troops confronted during the last years of the Vietnam war, was by far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result talks about compassion take place secretly and private between war ex-servicemen. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his both sons from fights with the marine have returned, warned of the Colonel a. D. Mark Cancian them before the fact that people could see her service from two different perspectives beyond the military world. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would look at them with a feeling of reverence, because it defeats rebels and to exotic places had travelled. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Other would ask themselves whether a &quot;furious, violent ex-serviceman is hidden under the surface&quot;, said Cancian which had fought in Iraq and has taken over after his return a high state post in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his working search, so he said, he felt that some of the Befrager asked subtly whether he is able to stand firm immediately after his return from the fight to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;If you speak of your service, you must hold the negative impressions against it&quot;, explained Cancian to his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The missing ease of the military is rooted partly in the missing interest of the Americans in the war. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Achievements on the battlefield become from a country that little experience with the military has and sees only little use during the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, picked out only seldom as a praise. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We as a nation do not estimate military heroism any more in such a way as it was still absolutely usual during the Second World War&quot;, said second lieutenant general David Barno a. D. which commanded US troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead of this the praise of the politicians and the public concentrates mainly upon the grief of an official member. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops find recognition for the number of the attacks which they have endured, have lost the number of the friends, which them or for the gravity of her injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The military positions himself to the growing pressure to hard reaching through with rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week an important hearing decides on whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention with a rape before the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Should it not come in addition, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant in the 11th week when it was violated at night by a soldier&apos;s colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October, 2008 and she returned just to her barracks in Miramar to the north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she hit on a male colleague who carried the 12th stack for beer on himself. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked them whether he might accompany them on a drink in her room. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;My alarm bells began&quot;, said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texanerin wiped her doubts aside. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &quot;Oh what, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wished, I would have belonged on my belly feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> The man kicked few minutes, after they had gone on Lymans for room, behind them, she pressed down and violated them, she states. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on the 18th of November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military employees wait anxiously for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia in which is decided whether a complaint which they have lodged against the former defence minister Robert gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, in court is admitted. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint states that gates and Rumsfeld have not gone forward against the widespread rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right one of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Submitted in February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint enclosed at the beginning of 17 plaintiffs who rose, however, during the following months on 28: 25 women and three men who maintain everybody that they were violated by soldier&apos;s colleagues or were abused sexually, and that the military it failed, to investigate, to condemn or to make available one appropriately to administration of justice after the putative attacks., </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says, she pursues the uppermost military guidance, because the problem begins there. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The military is built up hierarchically&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the single people who are in the position to to exterminate the culture repayment him? The guidance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Moreover, Burke says that it has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be a part of future complaints. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: Apart from the fact that all plaintiffs lay, so to speak, her eggs in a basket, they will submit, if inevitably, many other complaints to maintain pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of the defence for the ministry of defence, stated by federal state lawyer Neil MacBride, has made an application to reject complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The acts of the court, the Newsweek are given, perform in detail the defensive strategy, primarily, that the military cannot be accused by present or former soldiers for injuries for which it has come in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> On account of a law of the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government does not stick for the injuries which are added to themselves in the active service located soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The supposed damages originated during the military service of the plaintiffs&quot;, says the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The ministry of defence refuses every comment to this history. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are not still admitted to the service in the fight, the differentiation lies only in the name of: modern wars have only seldom clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact attach with local women in the war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds died of them in fightings. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is in the time that the military is modernised, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And she stands there in her fight not only: three other complaints except theirs are pending. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> In the Yale Law School a complaint prepares the Veterans&apos; Legally of service Clinic against four most important military academies because of supposed support of an anti-women atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> From this independently charitable Vietnam collects Veterans of America a complaint against the military before in which one concentrates upon the diagnosis &quot;personality disturbance&quot; which rape victims received to dismiss them from the service - a usual approach according to activist like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women&apos;s action Network, a group of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Their group lodged complaint against the Veterans administration (Ger. in December: Management of the war ex-servicemen) in whom she accused of her discriminating methods in her contact with achievement claims for people which indicated to have been abused sexually in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws was presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the congress which offer a row of clues. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 became according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and responses office (Ger.: Office for prevention and announcement of sexual abuse) of the ministry of defence 3.158 sexual abuses indicated. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, most abuses are not announced at all and according to own estimate of the Pentagon this number considers approx. 13.5 percent of respected 19,000 cases to which it comes per year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report which was published in March also examines the criminal proceedings rates: In 2010 20 percent of the grasped cases came in the military in court, only a half as many like in the civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burkes case describe her attacks as the only first ones of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lymans case she announced the supposed rape of the military police less than one hour after the raid. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> At this night, so she says, it was asked 11 spots to tell the details of her rape of a whole series about policemen, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker which came from a cut in his arm, it was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April, 2009, Lyman was belonged by a judge. During this hearing it was asked for the sex which it had before the infringement with her friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people stated as character witnesses in the name of the supposed culprit who was acquitted at last. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I still remember well the day when the judgment was read out&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought, the labour pains would start. I ran loud from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;You brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that I when I came out again to my commander said: This was not his procedure. This was my procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who diagnosed at last a personality disturbance and explained them for not fit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January, 2010 she was dismissed dishonourable, so that it receives no support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted, makes headway, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence to George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, so he marks: &quot;According to my view they should make headway.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a judgement, is this doctrine which is criticised, since it was questioned for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am all the life a critic of the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military limps behind decade, because they do not own the same incentive and the same deterrence which brings a liability with itself. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot;However, the chances stand against them... it is important for them that they try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will change only if good people are ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing does not follow her way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs will begin, with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will further fight against the military in this regard, until it comes to reforms&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or to us die, whatever enters as the first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: As researchers Sie on Facebook observe </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, different Behring Breivik was only one of many boys whom her anti-immigration opinion sent on-line. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday had Breivik which has been to have committed with an amok run in Norway in July with which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing in court. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik alone might have acted, he is not by far only in the Cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and has chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support radically right-wing groups on the part of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> However, how does one find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is light - one must log in only with Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We have found out that it was not difficult to come to them&quot;, says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOS about the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks hiding place of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers must simply use the advertising tool of the side to fix her desired demographic data with scientific exactness precisely - as well as it marketers for many years act. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found half a million fans of radically right-wing groups in whole Europe and visierte them then with Adds in, however, instead of themselves with a new volume or a new diet product to verlinken, the Adds the users invited to a survey in whom was asked for her level of education, her position towards power and the appraisal of her own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to confer with more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without they would have had to leave even once her office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a rather new research method&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results hardly surprise. On-line sponsors of radically right-wing groups are mostly young, male and are angry at the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a sort of astonishing twist are &quot;those which infer her on-line activism with an off-line activism more rationally, more democratically and less violently than those which stay down behind her ComputerBild screens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Demos work is only one example of how Facebook becomes new hot tools in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Idea factories, medical researchers and politics scientists use the side to study everything, from health questions up to society trends like in &quot;Likes&quot;, text news and status actualisations. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 millions active users who add on average three contents per day, Facebooks &quot;data supernova&quot; generates a research boom which allowed to rise the number of the scientific works with the name of this side in the title during the last five years by nearly 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that one can study by this side people whom one ordinarily does not reach with his Clipboard on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;If you tried earlier to question people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to inform first the party and it would never have granted admission to them&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;With Facebook all that is lost - you go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Other say that the side offers a possibility to recognise social health problems and to solve. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A topical study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found out, that the students who discussed her drunken stupor on Facebook, incline significantly stronger to the problem drinking than students who were quiet about this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests, that students of equal standing, for example, the residential advisers who supervise side and help a student, if this too many status actualisations postet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognised it&quot;, said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development in the Children&apos;s Research institutes in Seattle of the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a possibility to identify threatened children who would not differently have been found.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Moreover, Facebook taps constantly the data of his own population. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team of the side has provided statistics about the respect status and Valentinstag, election turnout at the interelections in 2010 and a Nationwide luck index and, primarily, information was used on which only Facebook access has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the side should make her big data goldmine for others for research purposes accessible.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, the users about Facebook know that the side observes them whether they want this now or not. Around with a friend who is removed thousands of miles to be able to play Scrabble one allows to the side to propose own personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook become a part of a survey about which they do not know yet something? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have strictly agreed directives as they collect her data off-line, everything is permitted on-line. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not think that many users have thought generally about the fact that a researcher could study her profiles&quot;, says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge rennet, to a study from 2006 in which he examined the public sides of students for Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;What she concerns, it was only about them and her friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is still the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even off-line there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook it is to be known impossibly, are true how many of the information in a user&apos;s profile and in contributions. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What one says on Facebook and what one makes outside from Facebook, are two absolutely different things&quot;, says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Hence, Selwyn in spite of his years thinks as a technology researcher that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools which everybody can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute to go out in the real world and to speak with real people&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research must look after the social - and a lot of social life takes place still off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Coldly and inhumanly&quot;: Differently Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Differently Behring Breivik, the man who has stood two amok runs with which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed has described to himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as an &quot;opposition&quot; fighter. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian opposition movement and a temple knight of Norway&quot;, he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I raise objection against the court, because you have received your mandate from organisations which support hatred ideologies and because is thereby supported of the Multikulturalismus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognise the laws, but I do not confess guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel home Nes interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he did not want to give &quot;Breivik the possibility to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For same reason he refused Breivik which brought a speech written to begin with to turn to the permission, at the end of the hearing to the members of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Moreover, home Nes arranged that the police of Breivik keeps for 12 other weeks in pretrial detention, he has no access to the media four weeks. He said that the authorities exactly control all visits and the whole correspondence more than eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in hope to be able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind castle and bolt. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Everybody took part with the aim that everything runs out to locking away. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought, he looks cold and inhuman&quot;, told a survivor about Utoya the Norwegian transmitter NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was disagreeable, but for me it goes on a piece, after I have seen the suspect and have belonged.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik carried a dark suit and a blue tie and looked quiet during the whole hearing and professional. He looked journalist and survivor in the eyes when he entered the building and left again. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In spite of Breiviks to weird tip, it would be a part of a bigger &quot;opposition&quot; movement, the judge came to the end that he is not demented and said that there was no proof of the fact that he would have had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Some may like it that the attacks from the 22nd of July apparently the work of a single extremist was and not of a group of radical. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But does make easier automatically the grief and the confusion which still feels a whole nation? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wished, he would look like a monster, but he does not do this&quot;, said the member of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be so much lighter if he did it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview with late Steve Jobs which was shown this week at a theatre </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on the 5th of October some compared him to Henry Ford and emphasised, besides, the technology genius as a big modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What Apple fans find, however, maybe most informative during the job interview discovered recently again which was dusted this week before special screenings at the important markets, is, how much this creative head has understood commercial processes and work routines. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was absolutely a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who did handicraft keenly in diagrammes - a man who thought that many managers suffer from an &quot;illness of the thinking&quot;, &quot;that a really wonderful idea 90 percent of the work puts out... (however), it gives a huge amount in craft art between a wonderful idea and a wonderful product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series &quot;triumph of the nerds&quot; about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat longer than one hour with jobs together in which they led one of the rare, detailed talks. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time had passed as 10 years, since jobs from Apple had been pushed. And he already worked hard on his new computer enterprise of NeXT, and was glad about the wide acceptance of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in nerd, he says that the copy presentations of the interview were absent by the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Only after job death one discovered an entire VHS copy in the garage of the manager. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film &quot;Steve Jobs: The lost interview&quot; which comes this Wednesday and Thursday to the land mark theatres. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For somebody who is known for the fact that he abhors to detailed interviews appears to jobs here unexpectedly keenly in the explanation of his technological philosophy and commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly thoughtfully. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview it comes four spots to longer breaks between question and answer - from 10 to 15 seconds of contemplation in which job weighs unambiguously his thoughts and takes care around exactness. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There is also moments at which Jobs&apos; perfectionism comes by days if he reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and him anschubst to come faster on subjects or subplots of bigger meaning. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone taken up the lost interview seems anyhow awfully farsighted if values jobs what other enterprises of his opinion make right or wrong and his own vision explains to the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is a thing to read posthumous acknowledgments of the career Jobs&apos;. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to the grandeur, is completely different a little bit, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision as the things could be and had to go his. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Briefly after he had explained this here everything, he set out and made it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick look at seven noteworthy sequences of the lost interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How he learnt to lead an enterprise: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the whole years in the business I always ask: &quot;Why do you do things?&quot;. And the answer which you always get is: &quot;Oh, so it is made easy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows, why he acts what he does. Nobody in the business thinks really thoroughly about things. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I have ascertained this. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs explains his efforts further to rationalise the accountancy with Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Amazes as costs were taped - mostly one began with &quot;standard costs&quot; which were numbered on bare supposition and which were adapted then with &quot;divergence&quot; - he developed an automated factory which made sure that the business expenses could be determined till the smallest. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How the pope was made fun: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs tells about the &quot;Blue of box&quot; which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could creep into the phone society and lead long-distance calls free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> About the device it was written already a lot, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue to box as an act of the Selbstbemächtigung is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how Wozniak and he tested the box, while they use a subject to charges phone, a phone call effect and then combine from an AT&amp;T network in another, while they so many satellites as possible durchschleifen. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We sent things half-dozen times around the globe and if one bawled in the phone, it came out one minute later in the phone next door again&quot;, tells jobs giggling. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we learnt that we ourselves can build up something which can control billions of dollar in infrastructure in the whole world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We both, we did not know a lot, but we could build this small thing which can control a huge thing, this was an unbelievable lesson and I do not think that there was Apple without them. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs further tells about a glorious prank, the Wozniak and he has nearly departed when they called box in Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue and wanted to speak with the pope, while they so well them were able to do Henry Kissinger copied. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called over in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, had to do both loose laughters, before the pope came even to the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> How he fell in love with the technology (and unpreparedly Bill Hewlett called): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years when he looked for spare parts to build a frequency counter he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer a part-time job in Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This had a noteworthy influence on me. It was the only enterprise which I had seen at the age and it formed my views about what was an enterprise and how well it treated his employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later became jobs one of the HP employees who visited the research labs of the enterprise in Palo Alto where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer which was one day produced&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown mole tube and I fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would climb with HP as a teenager upwards and hang on this machine and write programmes for them. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How one improves innovations: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times during the interview speaks job of how one spontaneously invents new products. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Quite early in his career when he inserted some boards he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He worked with a payment term of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly as well as the delivery of the ready devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later with Apple he remembers the problems which he had by the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember crucial arguments... They shouted at me that it would last five years [around a mouse to build who would cost 300$] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later we had a mouse whom we could allow to build for 15$. This was incredibly plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> About the big enterprises who decrease: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he allowed to revive Apple, foresaw jobs the ways on which so many industrial giants with her visions got in tripping and lost the control of her shares. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Do we say, you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopier or printer, so what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> They own the share monopoly, so the enterprise is not successful any more. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are such people] who lead at last the enterprises and the product with which the people from the decision-making are pushed. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product genius which has led to this monopoly position becomes from the people who have exterminated no draught with regard to good products versus bad products, - craft art inevitably. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This happened with Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> One could have been bigger ten spots, if Microsoft of the 1990s could have been... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have got the defeat of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> About innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A lot of craft art lies between a wonderful idea and a wonderful product... if one this wonderful idea developed, she changes and grows.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> One learns a lot about his delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> One must carry out votes, certain things which one is not able to do, but electrons, glass, robot, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> One must notice to himself 5000 things, bring together these draughts, and them all... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> At last it runs out to the taste, it runs out to the fact that one have tried, have created with the best stuff, the person, puts apart and then tries to bring together these things to him what one makes. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, wonderful artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shameless in the stealing of wonderful ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of that what made Macintosh wonderful was that the people who work there were musicians, writers, artists, zoologists, historians who are by chance the best computer scientists of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it had not been the computer branch, they would create in other areas fantastic things. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws when court accepts case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day in which the Supreme Court gathers behind close doors to discuss the politically sharing question whether one listens to a challenge of the health laws of president Obama two his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas took part, in a dinner which became from the office gesponsort that will represent the case in court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place the last Thursday when all nine judges met for a discussion to consult on the petitions to the check. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the too treated cases was a complaint which 26 states have lodged against the far-reaching reform of the health service which the last year were decided by the congress, a law which became with the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the catchword. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to the hearing. Really a 5 1/2 hourly basis discussion is expected in March, presumably their result will presumably start the presidency fight in 2012 which will be at the time in which the judicial ruling is announced in the full way. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will stand in court and state that the law is to be tilted will presumably be Paul Clement, once Chief State Prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, one was the nearly two dozen enterprises which the annual dinner of the federalistic society supported, an old-established group which devotes itself to the defence of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another enterprise, which the dinner sponsorte, Jones Day, represented one of the trade associations, which Nationwide Federation of Independently business which contest the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was of the Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc which is terrifically involved financially in the result of the process. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner took place few hours, after the court had consulted on the case, at a Washington hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Among the rest, service had Mitch McConnell, the leader of faction of the Republicans in the senate and an explained opponent of the health reform </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: Both judges visit for many years events of the federalistic society. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And this does not offend against moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Indeed, to itself the judge of the code of conduct relieved who regulates the actions of the low Federal High Court judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were it, they would probably fall under principle the 4C of the code which means the following: &quot;A judge can take part in benefit performance events of law of close and other organisations and the judge may be no speaker, guest of honour or according to programme no guest of such events.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Were nevertheless sufficient the extreme nearness of Scalia and Thomas to two with the case in connection for standing offices as well as to an enterprise with a massive financial interest in this to alarm government activists morality-and. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court keeps to the same rules which are valid for all the other Federal High Court judges&quot;, said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with floating procedures in the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their appearance and her support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas show little thoughtfulness for critics who say, they would mix court matter too easily with groups which are guided towards the agenda as for example of the federalistic society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&apos; wife Ginni is a known conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Against it the conservatives state that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was a Chief State Prosecutor under the Obama&apos;s government when the first law challenges came at first instance in court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of prepossession, because it would be engaged too much in the defence of the law to be unpredjudiced. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan makes no arrangements to do this. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing pulls ashore record order of 18 billions dollar </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Airline emirates orders 50 2 current airplanes of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Moreover, Boeing six Boeing Dreamliner sells air, a business to the value of more than 1 billion dollar to Oman. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is really rare news that an enterprise gets an order more than 50 pieces of his products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a big deal, if the enterprise of the Flugzeughersteller Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes all together with a record sum of 18 billions dollar lies. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The principal of Boeing is as unusual: the Middle East, a growing golden mine of future airplane orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a forecast which was published on Monday estimates the Chicago enterprise that airlines from the Middle East during the coming 20 years 2,520 airplanes to the value of 450 billions need dollar. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced on the week-end his biggest order of all times for commercial airplanes, measured in the value of the order: 50 2 current Boeing 777 Jets. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The hammer order came from the airline of emirate from Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Moreover, the airline has, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai aviation show, an option on the purchase of 20 other airplanes which allows to rise the whole list price on 26 billions dollar. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Then on Monday air ordered according to Boeing Oman six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner which improves the mileage and the comfort of the passengers terrifically. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The list price for six these airplanes lies with more than 1 billion dollar. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing&quot;, said Neal Dihora, stock market expert of Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these special customers is very high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of the Middle East are in the possession the oil to producing countries. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> So they have not only the money to pay the airplanes. Rather is an increase of the oil prices which damages as a rule to the airlines, because this is one of her biggest matters of expense, not so injuriously, because the country earns on a higher oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important, because they tend less than other airlines to cancel airplane orders or to shift if the oil prices rise, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;You have a natural security&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of emirate confirms Boeing Leadership position at the market for high-capacity airplanes and helps to keep in check the airbus competitor SAS which attacks the supremacy with the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing Victory on the aviation show there come four months after airbus has announced, one would shift the introduction of the biggest A350 which competes directly with 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> One shifted the introduction to win more trust, after the customers had demanded a higher pay load and reach. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% on 67.94$. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> Sister of the Mexican president loses apparently choice in Michoacan </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon states which drug dealers opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the running around the governor&apos;s post. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of president Felipe Calderon has apparently lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She stated on Monday, drug dealers would have influenced the running in favour of one of her opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> After the temporary results Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, the running has won around the governor&apos;s post in the western state. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of the organised crime during the whole electoral processes and particularly on the yesterday&apos;s day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country&quot;, said Luisa Maria Calderon during a radiointerview one day after the choice on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys... They have taken voting booths, have asked street blockades built up... and people to be right [for the PRI].&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Seven decades governed the PRI in Mexico, until they lost in 2000 the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential elections in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo only scarcely seems to have hit Claderon which had still led in the surveys before the election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, a nominee of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left democratic revolutionary party PRD, the governor being in office still currently, came on place Three, a heavy defeat for the split and without luck left guidance for the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Also Aureoles refused to recognise the temporary results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacan was controlled long time by drug cartels which have specialised in marihuana, heroin and amphetamines. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the homeland of president Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan for beginning a militarily controlled offensive against drug dealers in December, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The power still continues. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A Pan mayor was killed one week before the choice during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have got out because of fear of the local elections. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, all the same how disgustingly the elections also appear in Michoacan. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the running around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington congratulated and said: &quot;I think that this victory to us shows up courageously the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> ADB pushes Asia for help in the rescue of the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The developing bank of Asia (Asian Development bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in his heavy debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend which will brake the growth of the economy of Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Gnawing, administrative manager of the ADB with headquarter in Manila, said that both fastest growing economic nations of the world must do &quot;everything in your power standing&quot; to accelerate the rest of the currency block either by the international currency ground or by direct mutual arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned about the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) which look &quot;without passion&quot; at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European guidance and the European resources helps to prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy through Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We sit everybody in the same boat.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Everybody is helpful which can help Europe from this crisis&quot;, he said the Financial Times during an interview on the edge of the world economy forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;If China and India can help, then with all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Monetary union of Europe got during the past months in a heavy debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> During the past days interest costs of Italy rose dangerously and the prime ministers from Italy as well as from Greece have withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The upcoming heavy debt crisis in Europe pokes fears that the global economy could fall in the recession and led to calls, the leading threshold countries would have to get together to support the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag forecast that every support of Asia is canalised by the IWF, however, said that mutual arrangements - as for example the purchase of Bonds of the EU-rescue fund, the European finance stabilisation facility (EFSF) - to the European partners offers bigger negotiations power in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Indian Secretary of Commerce, said that &quot;India does everything what stands in his power&quot; to help the eurozone, because own economy suffers now from the sinking exports and drying up foreign capital flow. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants that the eurozone remains furthermore unstable and tumultuous&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We stand before big challenges and we must receive a high growth level.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is no option, it is an order, because where, otherwise, we find work for our millions of young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Other argue that developing economies like India have no occasion to help the rich Europeans if they themselves stand before big economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, professor in the US-American Brown University, said that it was politically very difficult to sell people in India help to Europe to 1.2 billions on which more than 800 millions of 2 dollars or still live less on the day in. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 go to pension and spend holidays on the beach. Then one has a problem&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, administrative manager of the world economy forum, asked alike, why reserves of India should be used to keep the numerous and well paid-up employees in the civil service in Greece, with jobs escorted in badly, losses to introducing facilities as for example of the railway. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag said that the crises have in the eurozone &quot;significant domino effects&quot; on completely Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> &quot;Now the risk of the gradation&quot; threatens the forecast of the ADB with an economic growth about 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 / on account of the menacing danger from Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said, vulnerable threshold markets would have to provide &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of her Wortschaften. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible incisions in the defensive being </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defence minister Leon Panetta put the heating on to the congress on Monday when he warned about the fact that automatic budget shortenings weakened the national security unnoticed. With it he released a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon up to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civil production lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already thinks through shortenings at the rate of 450 billions dollar in the course of the coming decade, now, however, fears that other shortenings become necessary about 600 billions dollar or more if the congress can achieve no end in the issues. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The effects of these shortenings would be disastrous for the ministry&quot;, wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said, a failure of the congress in achieving a budget arrangement what will lead to a so-called seizure would lead to 23% of general shortenings as well as a stop more numerously of new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a high shortening, carried out in such mindless way, would make most of our ship projects and building projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other modernisation efforts&quot;, wrote Panetta to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;Moreover, we would be made separate involuntarily from a large part of our civil staff and, because the reduction would be moved so fast, we would have to give time off with likelyhood bordering in security civilians to be able to achieve the aim.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those which maintain our military and damage our alert seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> At last the shortenings became the fight troops hit&quot;, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While the wartime contingents are concerned in the anti-terror fight by the seizure not directly, the serious intervention in the basic budget would disadvantageously influence the war efforts&quot;, warned Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;Personnel settings will support are shortened, what for delays in the settings and the setting supervision which would wage the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The salaries of the staff would be shortened what leads to late payments to wartime trader and the juridical as well as political support would be disturbed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Both senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details with regard to the potential influence of the automatic shortenings on the ministry of defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of a seizure of the ministry of defence would initiate a quick decline of the United States as a leading military power of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are vehement against this draconian action&quot;, said the senators in a common explanation on the Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is absolutely nobody that one should force us.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The seizure is a menace of the national security interests of the united sites and their entry should not be permitted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators raises pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthens demands to exclude the Pentagon from shortenings, remains to wait. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has pronounced increasingly bluntly the possible shortenings, although he could collect many years of experiences with the budget in the congress and in the White House, before he came to the point of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces to heavy decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> In a press conference last week the defence minister painted a sombre picture what could approach - the military with bowl, but without core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;Es ist eine Brigade ohne Munition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air force squadron without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission&quot;, said Panetta in his inaugural address in the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;These are armed forces which lack it morality and alert and which is not able to take up it with potential opponents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;She makes really furiously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta stated new details as reductions &quot;creates significant surgical risks: Delays in crisis periods, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our worldwide application and Eingreiffähigkeit what leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest defensive projects of the cancelation could fall victim, were already tested including those, which and are already in the early planning phase. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The combat pilot F35 also hears to this list joint strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines which new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and navy need to substitute for the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> If one stopped the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save during the next 10 years up to 80 billions dollar, but the advocates say that there is the important next step to the armament, so that to possible dangers can be banished through China and other opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How one unmasks a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the topical headlines shows how questionably and widespread deception and lie are in the everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is occupied to become a sexual harassment on the part of several women man to the accusations. Both sides accuse themselves mutually of the lie. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The management of kipping State is accused of the Meineids, because one has held back supposedly reports according to which a retired football trainer has abused boys sexually. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week it was cobelonged over an open microphone when the French president Nikola Sarkozy stated towards the American president Barack Obama, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shake countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner came along to the fool when he brought denials in circulation which were disproved very fast by irrefutable proofs. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the offence in the campaign financing which stands in connection with the cover-up of an illegitimate affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then forgets of course nobody who has experienced it, the media circus which president Bill Clinton has released when he has lied during his second term of office in the oval office with regard to his sexual respect with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories Cheat at school and in college check are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were incidents in which teachers her students have given the exam answers, so that they themselves stood there with her achievement examinations well. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The mentors who should teach the opposite dispatch news that lies and cheating are okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception do we experience? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> How studies book, we lie every day between 10 and 200 spots. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> However, many these lies are valid as white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that strangers deceive themselves mutually three spots during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To recognise lies or &quot;to uncover lies&quot; one is to learn is important for every person, and this from personal ones as well as for professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlour game as for example Scharaden remotely in which it is the aim, &quot;Has you!&quot; to shout, unmasking a deception is a serious field of knowledge which is based on scientific data which were collected in the course of the past six decades at respectable universities who carried out far-reaching research projects, in particular in the areas of Psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> A result of the research is that most old myths about the lies were unmasked. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies look to one in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They stutter, stammer, blush and not always thrash. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> However, out of this one may not close that these liars are hard to be uncovered and to be unmasked. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A skilled Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth, while he learns something about the structure of the assertion, the fine expressions, about question and timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the exposure. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability which is easily to be learnt and helps us in finding the way in our complicated world, particularly if the adjusting or questioning of people or negotiations or management belong to own professional responsibilites. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good to estimate other people, to wake up interest and to control own emotions. And they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research we know, the extrovert person lie more often than introverted people that men dish up more often &quot;selforiented&quot; lies than women whose lies orientate themselves more &quot;by others&quot; - as a rule they want to protect with it the feelings more different - that married people lie to her partners less often than unmarried people (however, the lies which they tell, are most &quot;fat lies&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if a person was unmasked as a malefactor other feel less guilty to have lied to this person. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How does one recognise whether somebody lies? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> As the first, while you observe the normal behaviour of this person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> One calls this &quot;Baselining&quot;, the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> She gives a reference point to later valuing of changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the position, the laughter, the vocal quality of her experimental subject. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> They should better know, when somebody ordinarily minces constantly with the foot, so that they accuse him not wrongfully if he minces during a meeting with the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then you pay attention to accumulations more conspicuously of verbal and non-verbal behaviour patterns. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Look at these accumulations as alarm bells, the shrill, not as a proof of an exposure. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The people who are deceptive maybe solidify if they try to remember her history. Maybe her feet point in the direction of door or them lean in the direction of exit, change her position in significant manner or show a &quot;relaxation after the interview&quot;, this deep, relaxing exhaling and the change in the position if all hard questions are over. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Questioners often signal falsely that an interview is past, only to keep a lookout after this relaxation after the interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Pay attention, moreover, in language of your experimental subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The gaffe of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he stated, his killed wife is still in live and a national search for her released. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Being deceptive people can also use an outdistancing language: &quot;I had no sexual respect with this woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or if one repeats a tricky question in the whole. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &quot;qualifying language&quot; if they answer a tricky question: &quot;To say the truth now... around you... so far to me is known... after the best knowledge and conscience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Through this the answer becomes rather perceiving as objective by which often the alarm bells shrill. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic cure for unmasking of lies, but one can learn abilities thanks to which an exposure is possible. </seg>

<seg id="1824"> Argumentative plan of an oil pipeline is reworked after danger by delayed US approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Few days, after the Obama&apos;s government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in the golf of Mexico with which one annoyed the trade unions and calmed at the same time environmentalist the enterprise building the pipeline tries hard to plan anew the project, so that one can return again to the normality. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on the Monday evening that one diverts the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The enterprise announced the decision in a press conference in the parliament building of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the enterprise is confident furthermore which is approved the pipeline at last, even if with an other course. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Moreover it came after an announcement of the foreign ministry last week after which one would adjourn a decision with regard to a federal licensing for the project one, until the new possible course would be checked which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a big unterwater supply. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real step at the head&quot;, said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared with fox terrier news. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental examination which has arranged the foreign ministry may adjourn a decision till 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama explained the last week in a written explanation that the decision is a job of the foreign ministry and promised his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 1700-mile pipeline became Canada with the golf of Mexico connect. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province Alberta to the refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Moreover the pipeline would have to cross six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Environmentalists hate them, but job markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> However, the legislators of Nebraska who are to be forced against the plan weigh the laws, around a turning away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main spring of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The topical study to the influence on the environment of the foreign ministry has found out that the project would have only little influence on the environment, but the spring of the energy industry says that the main examiner of the ministry has requested for a separate probe of the examination procedure which concentrates upon two questions. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is whether a lobbyist who was put by TransCanada, Paul Elliott who was 2008 advisers of Hillary Clinton is in a conflict of interests. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether an enterprise which was asked to carry out the original study was an immoderate choice, because she stands with TransCanada in connection. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti rennet ulna accused, because it made supposedly a toddler because of fear vomit </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A New York family states that the disco diva Patti had got rennet ulna in the lobby of her Manhattaner building a madness attack which would have moved her small daughter thus into fear that she has vomited before fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of the &quot;lady Marmalade&quot; singer made such fear to 18 month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffers from &quot;personality changes, sleeping disturbance&quot; and &quot;of increased fear of strangers&quot;, said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on the 10th of November of the last year when the stage hand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to break open to a family excursion. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm went to the lobby in her building in the Riverside boulevard. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said, she has stopped near the door and has set down her daughter for one moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Somebody appeared behind me and said: &quot;Do you know what just does your daughters?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes&quot;, and went to pick up them again&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Rennet ulna admonished the pregnant woman furiously. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;She said in an aggressive tone: &quot;You should set down your daughter not near the door&quot;, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I said her: &quot;It does not interest me what you say or think&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became furious and started getting angry - she used the fa word and the A word and was expressed very much... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to tilt water from the bottle on me. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She said, Genevieve would have become hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to this woman: &quot;See what you have made with my daughter&quot;, said the mothers of the child. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Rennet ulna rushed at the mother whom still Genevieve on the arm carried, and had to be held back by her company and be moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The baby shouted so much that it had to vomit, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later the family asked rennet ulna in writing for one Excuse me, however, no answer received. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> LaBelles lawyer and representative did not answer phone calls in which was asked for a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis is in a not closer certain compensation, however, said that he charges for no fee and plans the family, the money which she gets, the childhood cancer help will make a donation. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;We want that Patti rennet ulna takes over the responsibility for her behaviour&quot;, said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, particularly if it is displayed towards a kindergarten teacher who carries a 18 month-old baby on the arm.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Climatic adversities braked the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government the unemployment and the illegal employment rose in Sinaloa, while the foreign investments decreased and the economy stagnated. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> In 2011 will remain in the economic history Sinaloas in recollection. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez who calls himself the initiator of the change and poked big hopes with regard to the economic growth is in the government. However, as a result of the climatic adversities not the speech can be from growth, but on the contrary the most important economic indicators got worse. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions in the agriculture, but, in addition, put to the growth of the state economy narrow borders and caused a general decline of the economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter this decreases primarily to the historical dismantling of the agricultural development about 31.16 percent which kneaded holding back on other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Ger. Mexican advice for lasting agricultural development) published report on the effects of the frost 582,000 hectares were damaged agriculturally of used Ländereien from what 78.03 percent were partially destroyed completely and remaining 21.07 percent. Above all the vegetable cultivation, May cultivation and chickpea cultivation were concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline of the economic activity till November has the unemployment in the Mexican state continuously raise. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística Y Geografía observed a quick increase of the unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 inhabitants Sinaloas had no employment what corresponds to 4.53 percent of the acquisition population. In the second quarter rose the unemployment rate on 5.28 percent and from July till September on 6.19 percent what entails 74,000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Lower liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year decreases to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the faculty for economics and social sciences of the university of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the politics of the public institutions explains indirectly the growing unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we observe currently, is an increase of the unemployment which deals with several factors., Among the rest, with liquidity losses at the market as a result of the middle shortenings by the legislation which was dismissed to the fight of the money-laundering in the congress, because for those which accumulate against orders dollar it is not easy to let work this for itself, to invest them or to be of use for, otherwise, something&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Wanderung gestoppt </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes pointed out to the fact that a demographic factor is also inherent in the growing unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of the people who leave the country on search for work abroad, in particular in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult there to work to find. These people stay here and look for here job what raises the unemployment&quot;, believes he. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Illegal employment </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the job market in Sinaloa is serious still if one considers the high portion of the illegal employment. This encloses according to INEGI 60.38 percent in the country employees who work without depositing at the cashes of the social security. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> To the unemployment and illegal employment the low wages, lowest come in completely Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican social security institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo Y Previsión Social (government authority for work and social care in Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly income of the employees in Sinaloa cheat till September 5352 pesos; this is much less than the whole-state average which lies with 7375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Decline of the ADI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Beside the dismantling of the economic activity and the growing unemployment the strongest decline of the foreign direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years is registered in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority) amounted to the ADI from January to June, 630 597 dollars what corresponds to a decrease of 87.74 percent in comparison to the 5.143.312 dollars in the same period in the year before. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> A whole investment registers for their part the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government authority for business development) at the rate of 17 280,000 pesos in 2011 which comes before all things of enterprise from the Tertiärsektor. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The debts </seg>
<seg id="1882"> In view of the economic crisis the government in July with the national congress applied for a loan at the rate of the 3.000 000 000 pesos which should be invested to the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities. The land congress approved an amount at the rate of 200 600,000 pesos, however, no positive effects of the indebtedness on any of the branches of industry could be ascertained till November in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> For the representatives of the employers made the first government year Mario López Valdés Regierungsunfähigkeit obviously. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, chairperson of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of the processing industry in Mexico) represented that in 2011 no efforts were made to the harmonisation of the views of the different sectors, including the government. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It must be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we must twice exert ourselves. The strains all and in particular the progress of the already well government team joined on each other have not been tuned enough on each other&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Slow economic development </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López expressed that events, how the frost complicated the economic development of the country to beginning of the year and slowed down. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The low economic river is the result of several events, among other things of the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed down economy which is not enough in movement to cause an economic dynamism which could generate a suitable river of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations&quot;, he believed. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Appeal anew define </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairperson of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (enterpriser&apos;s association of Mexico) in Sinaloa explained, one must arrange the state to more dynamic productive activities. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;Generally we have observed that was worked. We think that it is necessary a long-term programme to the new regulation of the economic appeal and line of the country to develop, because it is to be activated importantly all material and human resources Sinaloas&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> There is a lot to act </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The chairperson of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a future perspective which steers the strains of the government in better roads. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;Generally I would say that the government has achieved good results in different areas. The business development has made headway, but a long-term programme is to be developed importantly&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> He stressed that the present state power has made progress at the government. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> &quot;There are areas concerning which one can say that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say, is that was worked and that the government is aware that one more amount of work lies before her&quot;, he expressed. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Arrest because of 8 kg of marihuana </seg>
<seg id="1899"> An inhabitant of Navolato was condemned to five years of prison and 100 day sentences because of the possession of eight kilos of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> The public prosecutor&apos;s office of the republic announced, the drug merchant is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval who was punished for a criminal offence against the public health - here the possession certain for trade of marihuana-. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> According to the act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I became Valenzuela sandy oval in 7. Junio in 2010 from the Mexican military by the supervision of the street Cipriano Valdez compared with the guard No. 80 in the place El Castillo, Navolato, arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The drug merchant went in a white delivery van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the carriage and on the front passenger seat a small backpack in which military eight kilos and 23 grammes of marihuana found. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> For this reason the confiscated product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punished is furthermore in the execution institution. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Debts for construction works </seg>
<seg id="1905"> In the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 to intended social constructions for migrants run the risk not to be finished because of missing means or only with big delay, meant Miguel Á ngel López Miranda. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The leader of the municipal authority for social development explained that, although the schedules of work are already progressed, they float now in danger, because the state government has not paid the means being entitled to her which cross millions pesos for three programmes 11. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> He said, the whole investment in these three programmes amounts to nearly 50 million pesos from which 25 percent fell on the state. Till present only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed means to the construction works, which is why a delay of the construction ending is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> &quot;12 millions must contribute them, and although the year already comes to an end, they have given us no pfennig, and he meant this, although they would have had to pay a part to us already in July&quot;. &quot;Not to be too late in it, we have already begun with the construction works, and they are already far progressed, but we need the money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1909"> He emphasised that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state to his obligations has not followed, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan at the rate of 7 millions at the beginning of his reign. This would correspond to the amount which the central government would have had to raise. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;This had already gone for us in the last legislative period in such a way, because the state did not dispose of sufficient economic means. The programmes went on and this year we had to procure the means which the state had not raised to take part in these programmes&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Even if the state authorities are obliged to the payment of these means, he commented that was applied with the minister for management and finances, to accelerate the administrative works and to pay the back portion as fast as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> &quot;Nearly 12 millions must contribute them, and although the year already comes to an end, they have given us no pfennig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The court approves the crossing on the digital television in Mexico for 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The conversion analogous on digital signals belongs during the last years worldwide to the most important changes. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) showed the complaints which were lodged by the senate and the chamber of deputies against the presidential decree and by virtue of which the change-over from analogous on digital signals of from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, on account of more being absent eight voices which are necessary to the law challenge, back. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, under it also the president of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, took the view who has not crossed president Felipe Calderón his competence when he published the law decree with the details about the change-over on the terrestrial digital television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this decision the constitutional quarrel brought to life by the senate was rejected, because he did not receive the necessary qualified majority from eight voices, so that the court can decide about the constitutional moderation or the not constitutional moderation. Thus the law remains in strength. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> In the project for the complaint which was worked out by minister Olga Sánchez Cordero it was suggested explaining the law decree for unconstitutional, because for them the radio and the television concerning regulations the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (feather ale commission for telecommunications is responsible in Mexico), which is why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservations. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favour of the project tuned only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument lodged the senate as well as the representative&apos;s chamber constitutional complaint against the law decree. After acceptance of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero did not apply the law decree any more and put all activities to the equipment of the digital transference. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The council of ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the representative&apos;s chamber, without, besides, in the debate on the project for which also the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project, namely in the sense that the land government with general regulations may not adjust the measures which the public administration should take. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I also do not think, that if one did this which would be affected independence of the regulation place&quot;. She also reminded of the fact that for the planning of strategical politics areas, as for example of the sector of the telecommunications, for constitutional-juridical reasons the central-state government is responsible, because this leads the state problems. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The substitute of the analogous signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes which has taken place during the last years in the whole world, and she causes a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, a raised quality of the signal and more canals. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Pushing out the conversion, she believed, is pushing open the usufruct of the digitization what is a decision in the public interest which has not only technical points of view, &quot;then she encloses economic, social, political and security-technical aspects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These matters, she stressed, &quot;required the action of the whole system, according to the principle of the economic management through the state they contained a group of signs which lays the constitution in the hands of the central-state government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> She called in the memory that many countries had already carried out worldwide the digital conversion, namely about the government, although they disposed of high specified facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> One cannot conclude that the government intervenes with the publication of the contested law decree in the competence of the congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative powers would be kept&quot;, she assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> To count out the possibility the votes in Michoacán individually is taken into consideration </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the information of PREP the difference amounts between the first one and the second place with a choice of governor&apos;s just 27 percent and 879 voices of a total of 6074 have not been counted out yet. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of the single counting up of the votes is this year by the elections in Michoacán a reality, because according to from the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) to spent data the difference between the first and second place by the governor&apos;s elections amounts to just 27 percent and 879 voices of a total of 6074 have not been counted out yet. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this sense the president of the Consejo has reminded general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de off Á ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the fact that just once in past 9th of November the electoral place had dismissed a row of regulations to the harmonisation of the local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral problems. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> One reminds of the fact that Michoacán had adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law still his law about the electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the congress, so that these were not come into force with this electoral round. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided her publication in the state indicator within the terms intended for it with the argument to have still objections against it. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> On the 9th of November the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint lodged by the local legislative powers and judged the voice of the state representative to the constitutional reforms as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot;, because this does not have the right to decide on it &quot;or to insert a veto against it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> María de off Á ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of the single counting up of the voices that thanks to the acceptance of the directives by the Consejo general del IEM insisted now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count out the votes partially or completely. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Thus the voices contained in one or several electoral packages can be counted out under the following conditions partially The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol about the voice counting up and voice calculation is not given according to act or it is not in the possession of the chairperson of the election committee or there are evident mistakes or changes in the protocols. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Moreover, the whole counting up of the completely satisfactory polling cards can occur when there is a difference between the supposed winner and that who stands on the second place which is immediately or more slightly than 1 percent, presumed at the beginning of the meeting an explicit application of the party or coalition-presiding which is the second one of the called candidates is given. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The voice counting up can also occur in her totality if is found out after end of the well-arranged calculation that the difference is between the supposed winner and the candidate on the second place immediately or more slightly than 1 percent, provided an explicit application of a representative of the party whose candidate has become a second is given. In this case the electoral packages which were put out to a partial counting up would be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It is worth mentioning that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation where according to PREP the difference amounts to just 0.16 percent between the first one and the second place, although the voices of 129 of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not been counted out yet. </seg>

<seg id="1977"> Tomorrow the designate prime minister, Mario Monti, meets the president of Italy to introduce to this the new government which should offer the forehead to the crisis which has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakdown. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Tomorrow the designate prime minister, Mario Monti, meets the president of Italy to introduce to this the new government which should offer the forehead to the crisis which has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakdown. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A communication from the presidency palace announced that of the Monti appointed on Sunday on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would meet to confirm the government education. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> One assumes from the fact that he will introduce a cabinet by the majority compound from technocrats, although is not clear yet, when the new Prime Minister will assume his office. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said, he would introduce to the president the results of the talks with the political parties to the government education. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I would like to confirm my absolute trust in the ability of our country to finish with these difficult times,&quot;, the former EU commissioner said the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not confirm expressly the government education, but from his comments it arises that the obstacles are overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Now the &quot;frame is well marked out&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has got in less than three days to form a government, this is much less time than normally. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which has done the costs for the debts in an intolerable height. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new government controlled by the former EU commissioner Monti must dismiss a hard savings package which was demanded of the europoliticians to regain the groggy trust in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The pressure to the haste which presses on Monti still increased by the fluctuating market situation as a result of which the Italian state loans were loaded for 10 years with 7 percent of interest. This corresponds to the state with which Greece and Ireland felt constrained to apply for the European rescue screen. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian confederation of industries Confindustria informed the press after a meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support this government after all forces.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We think that this government is the last chance, so that Italy comes out of this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The chances of winning Montis were considerably increased by the support of the party PDL von Silvio Berlusconi who had to withdraw on Saturday as a result of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> &quot;We think that the strains of the professor Monti are intended to cause good results&quot;, said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the central right party. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The support of the PDL, the biggest party of Italy, is essential, because till present many of her members have expressed themselves against a government by the majority existing of technocrats, the Monti forms just. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Support of the parliament </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Opposition against his strains or putting off the reforms could cause a disastrous attack of the financial markets once more. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks practices with his tip, a failure Montis is over a disaster, also pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and enterpriser&apos;s associations as well as with youth organisations and women&apos;s organisations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Tuesday evening the meeting round should be concluded. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano who has got going an extremely quick change of government as an answer to the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After short drawing a deep breath by the end of the last week as if became known that Berlusconi would withdraw the costs for the Italian state loans have reached as a result of the insecurity about the success of the new Prime Minister critical borders again. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> A rescue of Italy with a national debt at the rate of 1.8 billions euro, would be too much for the present EU-rescue screen. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said, his government must last up to the next elections which are held probably in 2013 to prefer in spite of the predictions that the politicians will give him only time to the conversion of the reforms, instead of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti expressed, he would take up with pleasure politician in his cabinet, but the big parties insist on the fact that this should exist only of engineers, a tip to her doubts in view of from the pressure of the financial markets of imposed procedure. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political springs point out to the fact that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements make the inclusion of people from the political life complex between the parts. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Spaniards have more play opportunities than the Ticos </seg>
<seg id="2006"> From 22 players called away from Spain ten have more than 50 international plays on the hump. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> From sides of Costa Rica only one of 22 conscripts has 50 plays behind himself. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> A gigantic difference for Costa Rica if 22 are compared for the friendly game which takes place today at 15.05 o&apos;clock in the national stadium of San José, put up player from both countries with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> While the world champions and European champions, the number one on the month ranking of the FIFA, at a substantial number of choice plays of the class A can look back, the three-coloured team disposes only of defensive player Michael Umana as only with more than 50 international plays. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> He reached this number on the last Friday with the play against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> The premier League von England read to Estrellas (star league) and high-powered clubs the Spanish players, in the league de play, have every year the opportunity to the participation in numerous home matches (league and cup masteries) as well as high-ranking European cups like the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> There the experiences with the Spanish fury come with complicated qualifying matches with the eurocup and the football world championships. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> However, the Tico footballers dispose of few international meetings within the scope of the Concacaf which stands on the FIFA ranking list completely below. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> We will see how the Spanish team pulls her last register: The goalkeeper Iker Casillas who reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign plays. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Today Casillas will play against the three-coloured team and Spain a new record of 127 foreign plays. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Xavi Hernández, player of the soccer club Barcelona, owns 106. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Casillas and Xavi received the last week even a recognition from UEFA, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the centre forward of rogues, Raúl González, with 102. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Carles Puyol with 97 plays also approaches the number Hundred. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Both follow him Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andre Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> From sides of the Ticos and near with Michael Umana are the left side watchman Júnior Díaz with 48 plays and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> From there only five came on more than 30 plays: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> With the least plays. </seg>

<seg id="2024"> From sides of the national team come on less than 30 plays Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> The rest not even approaches the 20th border. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> While Nacho Moreal has only four plays and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar only one and Ó lman Vargas and Edder Nelson registers in Costa Rica did not have her debut yet. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The historically significant goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz with nine most gates has shot, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and parks. </seg>

<seg id="2030"> &quot;In Costa Rica is to be played a dream which is realised&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2031"> In the exclusive conversation with Viva the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the tape is prepared to give one of her best concerts on the next Sunday in the national stadium. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> More than 20 years they were expected, but the tape were assured that for them a dream is realised if they play in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> This assured the bassist and cofounder of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva the last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview gave. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> The tape is in the South American part of her tour to the celebration of her 20-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20., they make her only stop in Central America. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> On this day they step from 19.30 o&apos;clock in the national stadium together with the volume The X from Los Angeles and picked up Robertas from Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> They read an extract from the conversation whose entire copy is to be found in the on-line issue by La Nación. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For your Costa Rican fans a dream is realised if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware what means for your fans? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> In Costa Rica is to be played a dream which is also realised for us. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is just once the second spot that we play in South America and Central America, and till present it has been wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I have been only once to the vacation in Costa Rica. It is such a wonderful country that we will remain certainly a few more days there. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> For us it is thrilling to bring our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask to you this because the fans the volume are proved to be complete. They experience the days before the concert most intensely. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you say your eager Estonians fans? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thanks to stand all these years on our side. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> We have used nearly 21 years, until we have come to Costa Rica. To have waited thanks, so long and we are sorry to have used so long, until we have come here. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people believe even that your concert will become the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Does a little pressure from your visit not exercise? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the most wonderful shows which we have put down during the last 21 years took place during the last both weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Us have played on a few gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope us that to us have made fit for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we have to play desire there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we surf with pleasure and are inspired by the jungle. For it Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How have you got to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Many of our friend are surfers and I have a wonderful friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply inconceivable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends have always gone for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this manner, about the people who love surfing we have got to know from it. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> With a look at the tour have offered her gigantic shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Which plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Because we have never played there, we also set to ourselves no limits. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer a good and many-sided repertoire to our fans. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat your repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe, this is partly in such a way because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs. Everybody likes another song, so that the decision which we will play in each case is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> If we take up two or three songs which we have not played long since any more in the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call the reasons in the memory to us, why we have liked these songs. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore, also for the audience. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour her your 20-year-old history celebrates. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, does it hard fall to you to your success to believe? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, totally. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First once I think that nobody has presented itself of us to play once in a wonderful rock band, and still more than 20 years. This works like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We also place further on this blessing and find great to be able to play music as yet together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We like each other and are enthusiastically to produce music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We have luck to be able to go to the places of the world which we wanted to visit always. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could stand not better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What did it mean for you to have taken part actively in the birth of the Grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big tapes. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are good with the people of sound guards, Mudhoney and Alice in grove C friendly. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is astonishing and richly unusual if a movement arises from a group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Every now and then a volume arises from a town, but it is quite unusual if five or ten groups come at the same time from the same town. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of it and feel honoured to be a part of the Seattle group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we still play together. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we were at a festival with Alice in grove C and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound guards on her tour. We are glad to be friends still with them to all and it honours us to be a part of this arisen Seattle sound. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very unusual that a volume has stayed together like they your time so long with the same musicians. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us already play together for 21 years and Weakly (Cameron) bumped 13 years ago to us. This is just much more time than outlast a lot of tape. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First once I think that we count ourselves happy everybody to be alive still and, moreover, we look around each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We everybody are a narrow friend, which is why musical ways have presented themselves which give the freedom to the experimentation to every singles. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your respect with the fame has not always been easy. On the other side you could make thanks to your success always this what you wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The kind, as we have grown, has made to us easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We guarantee not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy, to this play with the gigantic human masses which love your music to go to ruin. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as one remembers that the people have come because of the music, reminds you in it that you must respect the music and that what she has brought to life be without crazily on it to to be a famous rock star. This has never interested us anyway. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Which recollections do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe, we have written very good songs and at first it was wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were during three years a volume which had never published a record up to the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the tape with us, makes friends. If I hear a song or see photos, I remember what unbelievable person Andy was and how he brought me to the laughter. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other subjects. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was an extraordinary person and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The home tape Reading Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it right that her her works know, have selected in particular Eddie Vedder, and the tape, therefore, for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this tape best of all. Therefore, we are to be seen curious what Reading Robertas can offer live. This becomes exciting certainly. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter always when you play live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no notion. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings him, and I believe, he sings the first what occurs to him. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom were you influenced as a bassist? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> From so to many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Geezer butler, John Entwistle, C belong to the first who occur to me. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> These are so many that I could talk the whole afternoon about the bassists whom I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has it created Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge in the life, although it does not concern any more a fashion appearance? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe, we everybody do not feel very much linkedly with the word Grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> If I think about it, occur to me the tape which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, sound guards, nirvana and all the others which arose at the same time. If they are also important even today, I find this wonderful, because it is worthwhile this music to hear and now tape like Mudhoney play better music than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the beginning her music was darker, now it is more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I believe, there are a few songs on the new album which could look a little bit frivolous. But there are also other songs like The or Precisely Breathe which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have of some positive in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> To both the tears came to me when I heard like Ed she played. These are very dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe if you become older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. if one loses a member of the family or a friend - this influences your artistic creating and your music and these both songs embody unambiguously for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> However, I also take the view that one can be a happy person and even though play dark music. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> Peru: </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Fujimori came for medical investigations once more to the hospital </seg>

<seg id="2134"> The play which comes this month on the store bars of all world, was cut from the outset on the qualities of the portable console Nintende 3DS with which can be played without special glasses three-dimensional. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &quot;Mario is the figure which must say how the stereo copy functions without glasses&quot;, assured Omar Á lvarez, the person responsible for the press specified on Nintendo in Spain by the image of the video game in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Á lvarez explained, &quot;Really Mario 3D country&quot; is &quot;the first video game of Nintendo which has been developed from the outset for this console&quot;, because till present successful articles were like &quot;star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; adaptations already existing title. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The speaker of Nintendo underlined that, although it is three-dimensional, &quot;Really Mario is 3D country&quot; an &quot;affordable&quot; video game which permits a quick, liquid play. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Á lvarez confirmed that &quot;Really Mario contained 3D country&quot; two plays in one: The first part is &quot;light&quot; to catch the less geschckten users. </seg>

<seg id="2145"> The president of Guatemala, Á lvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday, he would grant to the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that this justifies itself in the United States for the conspiracy to the money-laundering of 70 million US $. </seg>

<seg id="2153"> Trinijove has 6000 have young, from the social exclusion threatened people helped </seg>
<seg id="2154"> The organisation was brought to life for the avoidance of the marginalisation by young people without professional training. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> The first 25 years of the social aid organisation of Trinijove have led to important results: This quarter century 6000 became has young, from the social exclusion threatened people supported to find a way out from her difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> There there come more than hundred jobs created for this social group. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Yesterday on the occasion of the anniversary balance was struck in an event in the former work buildings by Fabra i Coats in which more than 300 people took part. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> Trinijove was brought to life in 1986 in the town quarter Trinitat Vella with the aim to help young people with low education state, without work, with the drug problems which were threatened by the risk of the Marginalität. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Numerous persons responsible of facilities and institutions who have worked together during these 25 years with the association took part in the yesterday&apos;s celebration in Sant Andreu. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The participation of political representatives of different directions at election campaign times booked the impartiality of the work performed by Trinijove. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Except the president of the Generalitat (parliament of the autonomous region Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the festivities the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and presently left green town council of Ricard Goma. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> The big hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the present katalonische minister for social and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general manager of the social work of the savings bank of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mas stressed that Trinijove was brought to life in very difficult times and that the today&apos;s times are not complicated less. But he added that the work performed till present is &quot;a good basis&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> For the president of the Generalitat Trinijove is a model which knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulties to hope. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> &quot;The economic crisis is for the association and the work which he performs, nothing new&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> The occupied house in which gigantic parties were organised was removed </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The house-owners had taken 11 13 flats in the building in the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona). </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition to have performed. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything points out to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house No. 51 have found Balmes an end in the street. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people left yesternoon voluntarily the building which they had held illegally occupied and in which they had organised gigantic parties which had done the neighborhood to the desperation. The clearing occurred on judicial arrangement without without police intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> After the clearing the door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From now the admission will be controlled&quot;, confirmed the house supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters who had taken 11 13 flats of the building - the remaining ones were inhabited - the whole electric arrangement and part of the water supply took. Moreover, they had painted the walls and had left all kinds of garbage, above all tins with alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In three lower floors gigantic parties were celebrated which lasted up to two days and which tenants did to the desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Beside the building there is a disco, Balmes 51 which also carried off damages. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Their owner, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Pressing that her business would have decreased since beginning of the house occupation about 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the disco pointed out to the fact that the squatters made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the disco. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Moreover, the owner of the leisure bar had been indicated by the neighbours because of disturbance of the peace, while according to her statement the noise was due not to the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the parties who were organised there and became after statements of the angry neighbours during the last weeks more and more and longer. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The person responsible of the disco explained that the nuisance has been so big that she agreed with the owner of the building to have to pay no rent for the last nine months. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Also the Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more discomfort from the neighbours during the last weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The chairperson of the PP (Partido Popular - People&apos;s Party) in the town council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded the last week to remove the building immediately and to gain control of the problems of the middle-class living together as well as coming down the town quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building has been taken, but that the squatters had penetrated during the last months into all floors of the building and almost all flats. In some it had come even to thefts. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense he added that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to the impunity and to reach through against the antisocial actions in the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday another building was removed in the town quarter Nou Barris by the katalonischen police. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 15.30 o&apos;clock the police approached the street Montral No. 35, after it had received a phone call from a neighbour who had observed how four people wanted to penetrate into the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> Four were immediately arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects agree apart from the set-tos about the fees with the advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban advertising more than 16 gates opens the debate on the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona anew. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the middle of the 1980s, to the climax of the Corporación Metropolitana disappeared in the meantime de Barcelona (CMB), this management published her abusive writing about the support of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The pamphlet described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona to town. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was compared even in count to the Central park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the setting of the CMB in 1987 the park became in the eyes many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to few which spreads out not in north south direction, but upwards (mountains) and below (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification Collserolas as a nature reserve plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Now as a model any more the Central park, but Yellowstone with wild boars did not serve in the role of the Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far one was when the town spent a gigantic advertising, consisting of 16 competitions, on other access net curtain to Collserola in September. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Certainly a gate refers to the draught of a park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either this is in such a way, or somebody plans to put gates on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question positions itself by itself: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The advertising is not only from organizational view, but also in view of a reflexion about the town the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already nearly one rekurrentes subject, on two members of this old established caste which meet in the lift, can fall back. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare correspondence between that what three architects from Barcelona think about that, and some university professors who have applied on the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The advertising is measured. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> It is necessary for Roldán &quot;&quot; to speak after the attack on the coast of the &quot;front in the mountains&quot;, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda which has not been delivered about the green apples. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;One should assume from the principle that the biggest park of Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among the rest, because he is well accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complicated&quot;, there judges the architect for whom the title &quot;Gates of Collserola rescues&quot; a &quot;lexical trap&quot; in itself: One may fancy them not &quot;as accesses to a park, but as a containment must be traded by areas, on those.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with town planning experience, looks at the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; which rescues &quot;some dangers&quot; in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers as a result of the &quot;insecurity which brings the creation of a public space nowadays with itself&quot; after the experiences from the 1980s which had her &quot;swan song&quot; in the area of the forum. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is own containment on what may be farmed. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;To limit something always indicates to fix the next step&quot;, i.e. to cross him. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;One must think about new town planning planning instruments, because current [with reference to the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol which keeps more narrowly to the question means simplisticly, the side of Collserola which goes in the direction of Vallesana, &quot;cannot be understood as a park, in the direction of Barcelona&quot;, namely for purely topografischen reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol reminds of the fact that there is already a study of the patronage de Collserola which should not bump &quot;into deaf ears&quot;, although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given to his committee the possibility to help in this project &quot;from the first moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Moreover, he marks that the nearness of the mountains is the escort letter to the town which enables to the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his &quot;doubts&quot; about whether this technical profile the brought to life multidisciplinal teams (&quot;exactly the right thing&quot;, he says) should train &quot;We architects only one tools should be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona indicates that the answer to the question is complicated in the heading of this article, because in the advertising terms a global view of Collserola is absent: &quot;16 competitions were written out in the cross section&quot;, he says, &quot;on the axis mountains sea. But there is no profile perspective which looks at the area in his totality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has led at least in his case to the fact that he takes part in 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise the programme and the definition of a project would collide for a gate with of the architect of the gate besides. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> According to his opinion the town should absolutely guarantee that the stripe is equipped directly about the Ronda de Dalt in his whole length thus which originates a soft crossing between town and green zones. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal which gets free </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days of silence the authorised representative of the casino released Red the brother of the mayor from Monterrey of the process which is led against him because of supposed extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> After 72 days of captivity Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released, after the authorised representative of the casino Red has awarded him before the second penal court of the district which carries on the lawsuit against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey because of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the attempt on the casino Royale Sergio Gil García, the owner of the casino published Red, a row of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen who forces him presumably to the payment of a sum of money, so that the city administration approves the confidential company of the quits house. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> After the charge the public prosecutor&apos;s office opened a penal procedure against the brother of the panistischen mayor who was arrested on the 2nd of September for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos of patrimonial he was brought in the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> At this place he remained 49 days after the second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the criminal offences because of bribery and organised crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On the 19th of October he was transferred in the custody institution by Cadereyta because he had bribed presumably the owners of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in the medium security tract, because murder threats were given against him. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed to him to take part in the court procedure as a passenger of the urban prison of San Nicolás de off Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On the 25th of October a custody order was blocked to him by the secretary of the second penal court of the district, Jorge Yánez. This found out that after nearly two months of durable investigations sufficient proofs were given to speak Jonás guilty for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the quits house to be able to open this as a countermove. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday the authorised representative of casino asked Red to remit Víctor Aldo García Gómez the judge José Luis Pecina, to the brother of the mayor the punishment, which is why he is let go during the next hours. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the judicial hearing Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez asked whether this has repaired the damage and which the owner of the quits house has pronounced his forgiveness. Nevertheless, the lawyer held back the name. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> According to the legal case 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. Also in the following no objections can be inserted against the process, moreover, no compensation is required. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the hearing of the authorised representative of the quits house about 15.50 o&apos;clock Larrazabal Bretón was immediately let go. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the urban prison of San Nicolás de off Garza to inform Jonás that he has been acquitted and his case would be laid to the acts. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> He informed him also about the judicial arrangement for the prompt release. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details about the airplane accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretaría de Comunicaciones Y of transport - SCT (secretariat for communication and transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results about the accident with which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people died point out to the fact that the helicopter with his whole unscathed structure has banged directly into the ground, without the pilot could have initiated an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> With a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary mentioned for communication and transport that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather terms have been suitable for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The circumstances that the air-screw wings had at 25-metre height of contact with trees and the helicopter lost the body seem to point out to the fact that the helicopter had had several ground contacts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all conditions for the transport of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Moreover, he said that no helicopter parts were found with the investigations in the area on which the machine had come down. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;No airplane parts were found with the search at other places, the impact concerned the whole structure. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all conditions for the personal transport. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The area shows a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> At the moment it is priority to get the investigation results as soon as possible, indeed, even one year can last these several months, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> On his part Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Aeropuertos assured of Y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for airplanes and auxiliary services in Mexico) that the helicopter of the Estado mayor Presidencial had flown with the impact with travel airspeed and the airplane on a soft slope had liked. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information strengthens the acceptance that it concerned at the time of the impact a normal flight operation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2248"> With a press conference the leader of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, enumerated six relevant points which should be considered with the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> View flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In the harmony with the flight norms it concerned a flight under the rules of the view flight. This means that the team would have to have had sufficient view during the flight and on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather terms: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The AICM registered suitable weather terms by the start. During the continuation in the direction of the border area between Mexico town and the Mexico state some deeply hanging clouds gathered. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Elective flight routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that the team had selected a lower area with better view in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Impact place: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The impact co-ordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly there has been before the impact neither a controlling loss over the airplane nor a divergence of the flight route. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Verstreuung of the remains of the airplane in a restricted area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information being up to the current time points to the fact that the helicopter from straight and lateral direction had hit. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of the scattered airplane leftovers let assume that the helicopter with his unscathed structure had hit the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No tips to fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The remains of the airplane offer at the accident place conclude neither by fire nor by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last investigation results point to several ground contacts. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Airplane parts on a height of 9200 foot about the sea level were found with the investigations on site. The area is sloping and shows a Schrägung of from seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter has probably got broken. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some information points to the fact that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a minuziösen search in an area which went out the barred area at the accident place no scattered airplane parts could be found what strengthens the acceptance that the unscathed airplane structure had banged into the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces a research protocol for discovering of the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> She social security institution of Mexico leads a research project for discovering of the gene for obesity with children and youngsters which is supported by specialists of the IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (social security institution of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project for the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and youngsters under the title &quot;Genetics of the obesity in childhood and youth&quot; with which the genetic markers should be found in connection with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, main focus Biochemistry) in the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was built up. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of the postal postgraduate&apos;s course of studies in the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and in the Centro de Investigación Y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico where every Saturday from 8.00 o&apos;clock tests with children and youngsters are carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the federal state of México) began and is continued since the 8th of October on the sports field by Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the federal state of México). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the aim is achieved by from 500 to 600 investigation people, the study on the sports field is continued by Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and is concluded on by Morelos (in the north of the capital district). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained, the aim of the study is getting to know the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youngsters to the prevention more chronically of degenerative illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the worldwide day the diabetes he explained, it is aimed that 3000 children and youngsters should fill food-related questionnaires at the age of from six to 14 years by the consent and under supervision of her parents. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Questions about her physical activity and her informal illness prehistory are also put to you to control the risk factors which could entail diabetes or Niereninsuffizienz. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He explained desweiteren that on called Saturdays the investigation people were controlled measured (weight, size, waist extent), her blood pressure and blood values would be determined like the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification by genes in connection with obesity in the infancy). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López stressed, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health staff about the alarming increase in weight of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 proved that in just six years the portion of fat boys has increased about 77 percent and which of the girls with obesity about 47 percent. Also the fatness has dramatically risen&quot;, stressed the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He bragged, the search for genetic markers would be founded because the genetic history of the population of Mexico would differ from the other people. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He gave that (e) Mexican is European and to 5 percent of African descent (in) on average to 65 percent more Indian-in American manner, to 30 percent what to themselves are connected in the genes, with diabetes and overweight, reflects. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Quite in general he explained, the genetics of the obesity expresses itself in the inability to burn the profit of the energy taken to us (calories), so that this is stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained, the direct use for the investigation participants would exist in a comprehensive investigation of the children with which would be found out whether showed this 1 degree of fatness or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even the occurence of the dark skin folds would be examined in the nape and in the inside arm (Akanthosis) which point to the likelyhood of metabolism disturbances and diabetes in the prestage. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information would be treated confidentially and informed of the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all measuring results to the parents and suggest to them changes of the life style which are measured for the prevention by illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained, there would be three basic factors which are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: Lack of exercise, that is missing movement in the everyday life to spend most time of the day before the television and to use means of transportation, to walk instead of short ways. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high calorie admission, that is a raised consumption of sugared drinks and coal hydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger etc.) together with a high fat admission and egg white admission as well as the genetics which should be analysed in this research project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM prevents blow holes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistantly compared with weather terms and temperature variations </seg>
<seg id="2291"> It would be respected to the signs which go out from the paving, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 blow holes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher said at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured that if laying out and the maintenance of the asphalt layer happened appropriately which are decreased number of the blow holes considerably or are avoided even completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his paper &quot;blow holes from technical view&quot; which he read on the occasion of the international year to the chemistry he announced that the lab for which he is responsible with polymers develops modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt which shows, nevertheless, a bigger mechanical resistance with high ones as well as at low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera believed that this kind of modified asphalts should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, as for example in some towns in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the paving and to avoid with it the appearance of blow holes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a carbohydrate compound from which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they lend to the paving be a typical viscous elastic behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viscous elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that this behaves at high temperatures of nearly 180°C like a liquid, with 120°C he is very viscous liquid and is almost firm with 50°C, while he becomes fragile at very low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;That is that the robustness of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on one day as a function of the weather terms and temperature variations&quot;, explained the industrial chemist. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researcher of the FQ noted, the streets of Mexico town would have by the majority an adaptable paving which consists of six material layers from which contained the last three asphalts. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the uppermost layers lies a wear layer from asphalt which exists of small and stones bathed in asphalt hardened then. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single little stone of this wear layer, has been bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good force distribution in the paving. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;If it was a modified asphalt, would spread the forces even better&quot;, believed the industrial chemist. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot;About the wear layer&quot;, he explained, &quot;the last layer is laid out, the so-called Tragschicht which exist of tiny stones, i.e. of sand which was also bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Because this layer are in the contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a bigger mechanical strength than the wear layer and they friction must produce. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This paving most forces receives and distributes, needs the Tragschicht, moreover, an adequate thickness and the material of which she exists, must be kept in good condition. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather terms, in particular humidity and temperature variations, are other, important factors to be considered, before all things the water&quot;, he said, &quot;then it affects the behaviour of the wear layer considerably. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the area becomes humid, water penetrates into the layer and resigns only difficultly again. This causes a softening of all layers of the paving and consequently the appearance of blow holes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a blow hole originates&quot;, he said, &quot;the overlayer is used first, while the wear layer is affected only afterwards. But the damage originates not immediately, but it concerns a process which would have to be kept in good condition with the first signs by adequate servicing programmes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is an other important cause for the appearance of blow holes. Therefore, the thickness of every layer of the paving must always stand in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be made sure that for the avoidance of frequent blow holes this regulation is kept. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out to the fact that still many research projects kept waiting, for example, about asphalt emulsions which are in other countries even already at the market and with those itself the blow holes simply and without use of high temperatures allowed to repair. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What did the nominee del Valle lack to be the new Miss Kolumbien? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors which affected that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of the Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives his 14th Miss&apos;s title. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again Valle del Cauca went out blank with the assignment of the crown for Miss Kolumbien. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Ramírez Serna had to be content Melina to stand on the winner&apos;s platform, a silver crown and the tape which she expels as a new Miss Colombia to display. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result preserved this night in Cartagena where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar in herself the Departamento already comes on 14 Miss titles and Melina joins to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown nearly in the hands. Belong to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Á lvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question which many put themselves today is: What was absent? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Since the result corresponds to the decline of a big favorite who had shown by every presentation, that they about all ordered to be the new Miss Kolumbien. Not free of charge it had been chosen the queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the crown of the Miss Colombia with home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor which is valid as decisively for the decision of the jury of appointing them the first Miss is that she the answer to the question &quot;Which book has strongest influenced you and why?&quot; which had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, had not been convincing. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered to the questioner: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I believe, it is a kind to civilise itself, in the end, I think that the book which stamped for my childhood strongest is `The small prince&apos;, a rather deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment I read `guilt and atonement&apos;. It is a book of the universal culture which we should read everybody. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book, the `Leidenschaften&apos;heißt. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> An answer which bumped into little requited love, first because of the concept `to itself zivilisieren&apos;und secondly because she had explained not specifically in which manner each of her called book had influenced them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after end of the ceremony Melina declared to feel quietly and happily with the result: &quot;The universe is wise, it happens what must happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people: Read please a little bit `The small prince&apos;. It is a wonderful book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the rest, it is said that the darling von El has burnt out Valle. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferential who pocketed all applauses and had got in the approach all prices (catering trade competition Oster had made public vote about the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), &quot;the other nominees jealous what the queen put under stress who could not shine, therefore, on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And one noticed this by her first image in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and with her both lifts at the coronation celebration. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although she appeared as sure with both, nevertheless, she lacked the strength and the swing to which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme &quot;Como en casa&quot; with the canal RCN believed that the fact that Melina was crowned to the Miss &quot;shows that the nominee who wins most prizes during the competition, finally, nevertheless, does not become a queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Moreover, Valle went in the end for the press from the way - a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> An other hypothesis is that Valle could not persuade the Jurie with regard to her interest in the social work what is, in the end, the essentials of the national beauty competition. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It will already have his reason that two days before the arrangement of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained, they searched a woman who was involved in the social affairs of her country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only beauty is not sufficient for a Miss Kolumbien. One must look out at the physical and concentrate upon the social feeling, on the fact that she had already co-operated before the participation in the competition in projects&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> One also speculates that Valle with her defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose which one marked to her in the stomach area had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose them as a nominee for `natural beauty&apos; with a healthy body, good eating habits and more responsibly physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better ones, &quot;but her problem with the Fibrose in the belly which was hardly to be noted for me, to tell the truth pressed her score on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos takes the view, the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgical interventions to which she had underwent have been. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how it should allow to make them right. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Their body has never been her strong point, and this place she had to pay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this price which will award the first time of the national beauty competition, a cruel prediction which should become true at night originated after the appearance in the bathing suit. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize not to let come they to the pleasure of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> All the same whether this is right or is not, fact that Melina starts from today her ruling year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position which you offer the possibility to represent Colombia with one of the international competitions on appointment of the national beauty competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Indeed, she will come as one of the queens who had escaped in spite of her overpowering appearance for Cartagena the crown into the history. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali came as the man who identified &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, in the history. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials plays a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> In the past 4th of November a Lophoskopist of the inquiry unity of the public prosecutor&apos;s office (CTI) from Cali came as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia): &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; by comparison of the fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> From seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González Bereitschaftsdienst, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years on criminal preliminary proceedings co-operates. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó where he had to proceed often during five days in the jungle to reach the place at which the corpses were which he should identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 he moved to Valle and to the completion of the necessary courses he specialised in Lophoskopie, this is the investigation of the skin which is put out frictions, i.e. of the palms and foot surfaces. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week of the application against so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was pointed out to wrap up clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something tallness expected him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he flew in the helicopter of Palmira to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion insisted that those of the man who had escorted the oldest Guerrilla of the world can be. Therefore, he should take the 10 fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When he reached, however, with the Untersuchungste the place at which the corpse was, he could not identify him on account of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures which he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, carried no glasses and were much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the impression sheet. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had seen right: It was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Still the same night this man coming from Puerto Tejada was to be informed for it responsibly of the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it really concerned the boss of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Auf Spurensuche </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment which the president Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González in a press conference about the application allowed to be given against &quot;Cano&quot; very importantly. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without mistake rate which can be a key factor with the resolution of a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support inquiries in murder things and predatory things and confirm the identity of the arrested people. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> In her arrest many delinquents present wrong identification papers or they have none. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take the fingerprints from them and search this in the data bank. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall from a house with a theft, because the thief had propped himself up exactly at this point with his hand when he pulled out one with jewellery and money crowded safe. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;Walls are difficult because her surfaces are inexpedient for the decrease of fingerprints. But in this case we could take impression of the whole hand and identify the delinquent who had taken part in several thefts&quot;, he remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> With the help of the fingerprints can be also relieved murder suspect or be loaded. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> A dead person was recently found surrounded by schnapps bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> With the inquiry it was supposed that a member of the family could be suspect, and really a fingerprint on the bottle agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that it concerns the murderer, nevertheless, he is brought with the place at which the criminal offence was committed in connection. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist of the CTI explained that &quot;the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken by the object.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a tape is used to the entrainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then the impressions to the Asif are sent, this is the criminal data bank, or to the personal state office. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers&quot;, explained the expert of the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He meant, not everything is in such a way as it would be shown in the TV series SCI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As well as all gold is not what shines, everything is not also what one touches, a fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But, nevertheless, he can be used if one carries out a suitable comparison. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; challenge the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in tents on the place Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large part followed to the eviction order and changed his location in a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street challenged the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried with a judicial arrangement once more to enter the place Manhatten, after they had been removed at the break of dawn by the place and had tried to take another place in the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together before the place Zuccotti on which they wanted to get admission with a judicial arrangement which permitted the renewed tents to the &quot;indignant&quot; at this point. Meanwhile another part of the movement kept to the eviction order and took a park further to the north in the town where it came to nine arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not permit us to camp on the place we meet at another place and continue the battle with juridical means around the return to the Zuccotti, with sit in the peaceful demonstrations&quot;, said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement &quot;Ocupy of Wall Street&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray explained that the answer of the &quot;indignant&quot; to the clearing of her tent camp which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York came up to court where the judge Lucy Billings spent an arrangement which forbade the forcible clearing of the place and approved the demonstrators the tents. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Moreover, the &quot;indignant&quot; took a new park which is at the crossroad of the centrally situated Canal Street and the Sixth avenue very close to the entrance in the Holland tunnel which connects New York and New Jersey and property Trinity Church is. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> They could take the place during at least 1 hour. But then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can give no exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he has seen under it also several journalists with handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organisation assures, hundreds of people would have appeared on it at this point in which also a deputation of religious leaders had arrived as a token of her support of the members of the movement and to the mediation with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In the meantime, the place Zuccotti (an area in private property) remains unanimously in expectation of a judicial hearing which is still attached for this Tuesday and with which the legality of the clearing taken place at the break of dawn should be analysed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the demonstrators done by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement on themselves and distributed them. They gave them even to some policemen who guarded the place what entailed &quot;some small collisions&quot; as Bray reported which had registered, some policemen would have hit demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street of the place as well as the use return from the &quot;laws which were dismissed after the occupation and to forbid that the demonstrators with her tents and other things, which had used them already before in the park.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg clarifies before the press which has been lifted on account of this judicial arrangement the renewed opening of the place for the public traffic and the demonstrators. He pointed out the demonstrators to the fact that the town laws did not allow to them to prepare once more with tents and sleeping-bags at this place. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The mayor defended personally the clearing carried out at the break of dawn of the Zuccotti place with which nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided because the demonstrators &quot;offended against the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained, he would have given the arrangement to the clearing of the place because this had changed &quot;into a place in which the people came not for demonstrating, but to the break of the laws and in some cases to do harm&quot; to other people because &quot;some shops would have received threats&quot; and the local residents were worried &quot;about her quality of life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The clearing at the break of dawn was revolting and shows that Bloomberg is interested basically in the protection of the finance interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers&quot;, the speaker of the movement added, that the mayor did not accuse &quot;the freedom of the press to respect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The persons responsible of &quot;Occupy of Wall Street&quot; informed that they thought to organise &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday to think namely together with local organisations and trade unions, in two months which already last the protests since the 17th of September now. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Pamela Anderson is the virgin Maria during the TV-Christmas show </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian fames she will appear on the 1st of December in the TV programme &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peter&apos;s Christmas&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson was a Tim Allen&apos;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, rabbit with &quot;playboy&quot;, the woman of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now will be the actress and model with a Christmas broadcasting of the Canadian television the virgin Maria. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Today the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson appears together with the &quot;crooner&quot; (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian fames on the 1st of December in the TV programme &quot;It&apos;s a Russell Peter&apos;s Christmas&quot; and breathes life quite a special virgin Maria. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Today CTV spread pictures of the television programme, in the Anderson - also for the spreading on the Internet of a self-rotated porn in which she appears together with her former husband, the percussion player of &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot;, Tommy Lee, - virgin Maria with a doll in the lap which Jesus should show, appears. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene appears of Peter, a known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who worked recently as a presenter with the broadcasting &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; of Charlie Sheen, as a Jesus&apos; child. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> The Christmas programme of CTV places not only on Anderson and Peter, in addition, also on the Canadian singer Bublé who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and which does not have no connection with this controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently Bublé had called the north American Kim Kardashian &quot;whore&quot; with one of his concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan reincarnates after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The GDP grows about 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and finishes the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed which is to itself still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake which flowed into a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster, Japan to the 2nd world war had experienced. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the government in Tokyo valued the damages to property at 300,000 dollars, a blow which seems to weaken in spite of the difficult world economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three quarters of durable case the information served for the gross domestic product from July to September to conclude, finally, this chapter: the GDP grew about 1.5% in comparison to the previous quarter and about 6% to the rate projected for the year. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the business year in March, 2012 - moreover, the quickest growth means since the period March, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The reimpetus can be partially explained by the machine sales for the new construction from the earthquake and the following Tsunami to laid waste areas. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Really the enterprises raised her investments by 1.1% in comparison to the decline by 0.9% for the investments which were registered from January to March the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Nevertheless, the actual change of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively from keynsianischen impulses which use the crisis to build up infrastructures or to build anew. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> There has woken Japan in particular thanks to the development of the domestic consumption which puts out currently 60% of the Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable rose by 1%, pushed from the growing issues for vehicles, trips and leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has confided in the home market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - to itself in one of the &quot;shelter currencies&quot; of the investors who flee before the debt crisis of the eurozone and the murky forecasts for the USA, a privilege which presses like a gravestone on the accounts of the export enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> By a harder currency the products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology producers. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota and Sony, for example, led back her weak commercial results from July till September on the quotation of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets also besieges furthermore the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains watchful. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;One must pay attention to the persistent risks, yesterday, for example, on the deterioration some foreign Ökonomien, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the quick revaluation of the yen&quot;, meant the Assistant Secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The perspectives are not really very cheering up. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) explained that most member states had shown clearer signs for a slowing down of the economic development in September. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator which preexcludes the turning points of the world economy brought to light that with the biggest economic abilities the brake would have moved. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Since he sank by four tenths up to off 100.4 points in comparison to 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The eurozone lies even below this average value which lies with 100, after she has sunk by eight tenths on 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens lets arise doubt again </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos says, the economy measures would be dismissed, but the conservatives will sign no written agreement </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the forced up risk premiums of the peripheral countries and spreading insecurity Greece gets also lost further in the labyrinth that from the big European debt crisis leads out. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek caretaker government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly booked by facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday to the fact pointed out that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that are with his appointment to arranged hundred days possibly too briefly for their conversion, the leader of conservative party of Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samara assured that he the new economy measures support and on no account his demand of new elections to the intended date to which the 19th of February, will take back. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The most important job of this government is the conversion of the decisions which were met at the summit from the 26th of October&quot;, assured Papadimos yesterday for the opening of a parliamentary debate which will reach her high point tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package with 24 programmes for the occupation support, to the reform of the disciplinary law for official and new measures against the tax evasion are the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Nevertheless, communication of Samara does not clear the doubts about his position: &quot;We have ourselves to the support of the caretaker government obliges, but, otherwise, to nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leader went for 1 step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IWF, to the organism which has to do the 8000 millions which Athens urgently needs entsperren. He clarified that he favoured no obligation explanation about the fulfilment of the economy measures. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But yesterday the European Commission which is still irritated because of the effects of the poker play with Papandreu referendum confirmed once more, her demand is not to be shaken: The economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties did not sign &quot;an unequivocal written agreement as soon as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The speaker of the economics ministry, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika came back &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government, &quot;what is necessary for the payment of the sixth segment&quot; at the rate of 8000 million euros &quot;&quot;, although there is still no final date. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek ball still has for threads for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Queen Sofía: &quot;These are instruments for progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The queen stressed the &quot;prevailing&quot; position of Spain concerning this financing kind </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has reached worldwide a prevailing position with the role of the Kleinstfinanzierungen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Yesterday the queen Sofía von Spanien reminded of the fact that Spain has developed in last both decades worldwide to the second donator for these means to the international cooperation. His &quot;being&quot; is based on the fact that it concerns an &quot;instrument for the social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity on the basis of the trust in the person&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Yesterday the queen initiated the fifth world summit about Kleinstkredite into Valladolid. She was persuaded that there would be &quot;no doubts&quot; at the fact that this kind of shops would be &quot;absolutely essential to reach which from the United Nations up to 2015 to put millennium aims and &quot;in particular the aim, the personal number which must live with income from less than one dollar on the day, so below the &quot;poverty border&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;also works furthermore&quot; on the expansion of the beneficiary&apos;s net &quot;till the last corner of the world and it carries out this job responsibly&quot;, noted the queen Sofia who hopes that the initiatives and contributions which lasts from the summit, that till Thursday will go out, &quot;the creation of new capacities and better chances for the poorest and in particular for women&quot; than principal beneficiaries of these advances are guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;We have registered a lot of success &quot;and&quot; face to many challenges.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit about Kleinstkredite is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to the impulse &quot;of two basic aims&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> The queen explained, it is aimed that till the end of 2015 175 millions poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten millions these households will cross the poverty border. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The concept of the Kleinstkredite decreases in Spain and the remaining world on from Muhammad Yunus &quot;years ago initiated way&quot; which the queen Sofia judges as an &quot;act of the justice and recognition&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> She described the father of this financing instrument as an &quot;admirable idealist who has made a mistake to the fight against the poverty&quot; and his work she knows for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the advance strategy on site. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> The first world summit in Washington and other meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada followed a year this experience later in 2006. With all we could observe &quot;a continuous advancement&quot;, explained the queen whose engagement for this project introduced in her yesterday the judgement as &quot;a head of a family&quot; in Valladolid and as an &quot;advocate of the arms&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the queen Sofia finished her talk, while she animated the persons present to the participation in the debate and to the search for solutions in the fight against the poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical order&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Spanish foreign minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out to the fact that solidarity is &quot;an ethical order&quot; for the whole democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense she stressed, it is a mistake to bind the development aid to times to economic booms, because it concerns a &quot;lasting obligation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez believed that the Kleinstkredite a &quot;serious and severe politics is to the eradication of the poverty&quot;, and that the governments of the industrial states would have to work now &quot;more than ever&quot; according to united criteria, and might not allow that the solidarity of the crisis falls victim. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain are the Kleinstkredite one of the &quot;most important forms of the development aid&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Assistant Secretary for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot;, &quot;marginalisierten&quot; people, &quot;always before close doors stand&quot; &quot;hope&quot; to lend and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, was called the persons present in a town welcome which opens &quot;her gates, been infected by the mind of the solidarity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU suggests choosing the EU president on account of general casting of votes </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14th of November in Leipzig ran for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairperson of the Christian Democrat party, without real difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was planned originally not in the programme, but has asserted itself in autumn, in particular around that activist is enough to perform who estimate the government policy concerning the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The presidency application suggested by the presidium of the European Commission was accepted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Among 1001 delegates only nine had been right against it, ten had abstained from the voice. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The Standing continuing several minutes ovation which were valid first Angela Merkel as well as some hours late Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen on the part of three European-leant towards Ministers of Finance no doubt on the basis of their intervention decrees openly. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of the chancellor carries - just as the application - the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less, but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only, because Europe peace is meant, but also because &quot;nine million jobs are dependent directly on the euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the chancellor &quot;the time for a breakthrough has come in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could be expressed by the control of the European Union encouraging modification of the Lissabonner contract concerning the budget politics of the countries in the eurozone; nevertheless, also this could flow in the choice of the president of the European Commission on the basis of general casting of votes&quot; to lend a face to Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Nevertheless, this is anyway one of the application proposals adopted by the congress to which unambiguously Wolfgang Schäuble was the inspiration. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Absolutely it is likely only a little, that 47 to themselves quickly on this revolution to some: Gro  Britain is faces to the thing negative, and the leading of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> Nevertheless, the landmark is laid. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Also the delegates have rejected the proposal of the weighting of every country in the EZB board of directors according to the weighting of the single Ökonomien in the overpowering majority what would bring obviously an Erstarkung of the position of Germany with itself. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Hence, on reassurance of the climate within her party careful chancellor has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. Nevertheless, she has not tried any more to win her congress at the expenses of the &quot;small ones&quot; or the European countries itself located in difficulties which would immediately criticise haughty Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> As far as the European application of the importance of the &quot;German French friendship&quot; dedicates a section, does not shout Angela Merkel France on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Since this reminds of the fact that Leipzig stood two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Actually one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What does the deception represent with notifications of sickness? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Now after the family allowances UMP and government tackle the notifications of sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy becomes on Tuesday, arrive 15th of November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance cash and to bring forward a speech about this - already since 2007 always returning - subject of the fight against social deception as well as economic dependence on the state. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> To accompany this attack which goes out from the aspiration to submit the economy in a hardness test, on the other side, nevertheless, less herald of an axis of the right presidency campaign does not explain, the majority wants to concentrate upon employee&apos;s notifications of sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First with budgetary-economic aim: the government visiert the introduction of the fourth Karenztages before consideration of a notification of sickness with employees in the private sector in. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In well German this means that an ill employee would lose the wage of four days, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income without approval of the specific company. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A Maβnahme which according to the newspaper &quot;Les Echos&quot; Rage threatens to bring on, however would help to introduce 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And the character rather symbolic with another Maβnahme would walk along: for the civil servants to put away an unreimbursed Karenztag in the case of illness (up to now there is for them, in the contrast to three Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Meanwhile these questions in the discussion stand, the majority also kindles the deception topic from new one and this time is aimed at the abuse linked with working absence. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Controls will be substantially more important, and, in addition, these are to be refunded if this is demanded&quot;, warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13th of November about the microphone of the transmitter RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As well as in other cases the effects of this announcement concerning the reality of deceitful actions in the area of the notifications of sickness seem a little out of proportion. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Indeed, this is already since 2002 an object of permanent observation as well as political offensives which have yielded most often fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not any more more often ill than people elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> If we stay, nevertheless, first with the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the land health insurance scheme CNAM were paid in 2006 more than 237 million euros of day compensations. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Gemä β of the economic research and documentation institute of the health service showed the day compensations in 2008 with 11.3 milliard euros of 5% of the health expenses. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount 46% fell with regard to maternity vacation as well as work accidents and 54% concerning illness vacations, heiβt 6.2 milliard euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And, therefore, 2.5% of health expenses. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010 on an average only 14.5 sick person&apos;s days were conceded to the French compared with 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting Gruppe. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average which covers up certain differences: an another, in 2007 from Monster.com, website for career planning, was published, indicated, that 75% of 40. 000 questioned, French employees gave to have taken no sick person&apos;s day. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> An another, this time from the health insurance grasped study clarifies that 37% of the notifications of sickness were in 2010 from shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% about that. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared to her European neighbours the French employees do not tend more than somewhere else to unfitness for work. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> In 2010 from two researchers of the French, state centre for science research (CNRS) controlled long time studie showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (illness empire or otherwise reasonably) oscillated, namely in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The deception with notifications of sickness shows a vanishing low portion concerning the illegal employment. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> With regard to the deception only one weak Ausma β is reached here. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The confirmation of the legislation since 2002 brings with itself that there are systmatische controls with notifications of sickness which cross 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008 has found out the CNAM (public college for education and continuing education of engineers and engineers) less than 1.5 million controls that 13% were 285,000 of the realised, short-term notifications of sickness, heiβt in 37,050 cases&quot;, unwarrantedly or too long&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> With the systematically controlled notification of sickness cases of more than 45-day duration one counted less than 1.2 millions 11% in &quot;non-conformist or unwarranted&quot; cases, heiβt 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> All together make these 169,000 &quot;unwarranted&quot; cases on several million employees who have asserted a notification of sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure which represents only one weak Ausma β towards, for example, that of the illegal employment. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to UMP-delegated Dominique Tian, author of a material report appeared in July concerning this question, this explains between 9 and 15 milliard euros of tax loss of profit per year, i.e. more than the total expenses in day reimbursements, and therefore substantially more than the Defraudation with last-named. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Dad&apos;s demos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece needs a new adaptation programme to the interception of his economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> The prime minister Luca dad&apos;s demos had on Monday this, 14th of November before the parliament under adding the fact announced that they were not sufficient to his government on the part of the union for put away 100 days to do this job. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To be able to continue the efforts towards an Erstarkung of the economy, we need support of our European partners as well as a new programme for the budget adaptation&quot;, explained the head of government in his first public speech with the Eröffung of the debate on the vote of confidence of the parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The conversion of the decisions made on the occasion of the eurosummit on the 27th of October is the &quot;major task&quot; of the new government, because the co-operation of the country within the eurozone would stand &quot;at stake&quot; how he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly M has. To lower dad&apos;s demos planned, the state deficit of the country &quot;about 9%&quot; of the gross domestic product from today up to the end of the year, after this lay in 2010 10.6% and in 2009 with 15.7%. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The rights rejects the new Sparmaβnahmen </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis of Samara, boss of the right wing, his approval with the already approved Maβnahmen had given on Monday concerning to escaping from the debt crisis of serving attempt, had sent on ahead, however, that his party would not become an additional Sparmaβnahme ready erkären. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favour of new Maβnahmen&quot;, he said on the occasion of a representative&apos;s meeting of his party new democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He had volunteered with the default of the reduction of budget deficit and debts, just as, however, to the fight against the waste, faced of every politics hostilely which would prevent the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Olli Rehn, with economic duties and currency duties of entrusted EU-Kommisar which had prevented that IWF and the EU release the necessary advance more than 8 milliard euros not without written guarantee of all parties about their support of the planned Maβnahmen had answered of Antonio Samaras that his word is enough and he would sign nothing under pressure of Auβen. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to an expert&apos;s committee </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in refusal of the death as it arises from a report of the royal society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The committee explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and doctors concerning analgesic treatment worked together around the best analgesic means to provide, and this also about the cancer cases going out. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society lives in a refusal position towards the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of the Canadians get really involved to speak with her doctor of conditions under which they would like to die and arrangements hit for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the royal society of Canada in which six experts were involved who are tied together in different fields, among the rest, ethics, right and medicine, with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends to the government to change so the penal law to permit accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice positions itself, namely with the patients who are looked as in the situation to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada has placed itself, on this occasion, on the 10th rank, the study notes that &quot;the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has produced a culture in which the people are afraid to broach the subject Death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to analgesic means, report to us about the royal society of Canada ordered expert. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And in spite of the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home 68.6% die, nevertheless, at last of these in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> From the whole country is looked the rate with 86% in deaths stamped in the hospital in Quebec highest. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the awkward question with regard to euthanasia and accompanied suicide the authors of the report come to conclusions which are of the position of the federal government which already has geäuβert to want to carry out no changes of the penal law with regard to euthanasia and accompanied suicide entgegengerichtet. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Now, however, there is according to the experts who have examined gleichermaβen all those countries whose beginning legalises euthanasia and accompanied suicide or entkriminalisiert have, no proof that such a decriminalization would cause Miβbräuche in their use, so of the practise realisation of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or not agreeing people. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary one meets substantially more cases of such violations just in the countries in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, like yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a tele-conference confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is carried out in Canada where it is unambiguously unlawful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Also accompanied suicide is carried out in Canada, although here unambiguously illegally&quot;, explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians recommend the euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> If we visualise that themselves according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010 already 85% of the Canadians had in favour of the euthanasia geäuβert, because they believe, this allows to people at the end of her life to reduce her sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% think that the circumstances of a legalisation of the euthanasia does not entail to provide the message, that the life of older or handicapped people less value besäβe. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Concerning the people who have already carried out an accompanied suicide the interviewees represent the opinion to 41% that these should be pursued not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> What concerns maintenance or setting of the means with patients, situation explains as less clear, according to the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also these suggest in her recommendation list that should be given in the penal law that setting down the means for which a valid refusal has been given should not be valid as criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> In addition, the expert&apos;s committee demands that experts of the health service should be trained in the job, setting down the means in the end of life to respect, and to have to fear this without criminal pursuit. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The committee explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and doctors worked together concerning analgesic treatment to provide the best analgesic means, and this also about the cancer cases going out. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> At last the committee concerning already in the Canadian institutions to the hygiene demands extensively applied means to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take into consideration at least this, because these served just as little like the euthanasia to reduce physical pains and these would refer to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reservations of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts on the legal area of the health service have already brought forward reservations concerning the conclusions of the expert&apos;s report of the royal society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, has called the position of the report-signing experts, among the rest, &quot;extreme&quot;, because this of the euthanasia practise sets no limits with sick people in the final phase. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the gates for a situation, in which every which is weary of life and older than 18 years to ask another person be to him with his suicide helpfully to&quot;, according to RA Deschamps which had looked through yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report seemed to put the own responsibility of the singles about all the other values which are involved in the social Gewirke of the society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Now however, so he says, there would be &quot;guidelines and obligations in a society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, has also expressed &quot;a strong opposition&quot; compared with the conclusions of the report which she addressed as &quot;a pro-euthanasia manifesto&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville whom even member of the royal society of Canada is doubts in particular the report data with regard to the non-presentation of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalised, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2568"> He has reacted, by the way, with stress to the decision of the Arabian league to suspend Damascus from his duties, what explains to his appraisal after a &quot;dangerous step&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Syria &quot;will not give way&quot;, he added under the protestation, &quot;the plot hammered against Syria would miss&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2615"> Of the new tab. &quot;Activity&quot; and another &quot;name&quot; allow better legible live Understand of the activities of other &quot;Twitterer&quot;, the Internet users whose news (&quot;Tweets&quot;) one pursues and they pursue your news. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> This enables to find out whether these allow to pursue her news whether they subscribe new contributions, certain news favours etc. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> This new Twitter-menu offer had been tested before his general Internet spreading on Monday &quot;in August with a low percentage in users&quot;, bragged the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Twitter was known for his a little instinctive functioning, equipped with text seeming a little bit esotherisch (RT to referenzierten Repeat of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur initiés, s&apos;ouvre ainsi an un publicly plus generous avec un maniement plus comparable a celui réseaux grand publicly Facebook et Google +. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> On the network debated user with the help of certain &quot;Tweets&quot; on Internet about this innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> &quot;This is pointless, meddlesome and resembles too much Facebook&quot;, writes @jemb123. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> &quot;The function &quot;activity&quot; will help me to pursue certain elements of my Flux-Twitters better&quot;, announced @dannykronstrom. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Austria </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Registration of a &quot;golden budgetary rule&quot; in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The government itself located in Austria in power of the groβen social-democratic / Christian Democrat coalition has decided on Tuesday to take up a &quot;golden budgetary rule&quot; in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible degradation on the part of rating agencies in the top credit standing of Austria (AAA). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann was extremely personal who had announced this decision of the exit of the council of ministers, although the public Austrian state guilt is with 74.6%, so by far about the criterion settled by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, however, clearly below the debt level of the countries like Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If had not sunk the solvency of Austria on a blow of AAA on FO +, we would have to pay every year three milliard euros of interest, in addition&quot;, Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democrat Auβenminister argued. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria also grants of a demand of the Brussels summit of the member states of the eurozone from the 26th of October: At that time the heads of state and heads of government would have required the admission of the reduction of public deficits till the end of 2012 as well as a return in the public account balance in the constitution or by decree of an equivalent law. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The Maβnahme seized moreover by the Austrian government resembles the &quot;German model&quot;, because Germany had been the first European country which had taken up such &quot;a rule&quot; in the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Up to 2017 the structural budget deficit should fall every year about 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the federal state should not cross 0.35 % borders of the GDP, while the regional states just as the municipalities should show well-balanced households. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Aim is to eradicate the budgetary debts under by the Meuse funnel agreement of settled 60 % criteria in the horizon of 2020/21. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Steiferer Yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threatens with a new intervention at the currency markets </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda has warned on Tuesday about the fact that the Japanese authority intervened once more at the currency markets, if the yen should rise furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;Should we ascertain an excessive Volatilität&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen &quot;, we will also intervene as we have done it the last time&quot;, explained M. Noda in the senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday the yen had jumped up again near to the historical levels which had forced the Japanese authorities on the 31st of October for intervening. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> On this day Tokyo had sold massively yen against dollar to lower the Japanese foreign currency value which is about to head for a new record value since 1945 compared with the dollar. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> Nevertheless, the yen has risen regelmäβig about that, doped by purchases of the investors who look at the yen as &quot;a shelter value&quot; in these unsafe times of world economy recession and indebtedness crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar has liked on Tuesday less than 77 yens, the euro has slided under the symbolic slat of 105 yens in the nearness of the levels which had the last intervention getriggert. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009 more taken down the dollar around 120 yens, the euro more than 160 yens. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This straw fire of the Japanese foreign exchange damages to the exports of the archipelago, because it raises the price of the costs of the &quot;maggot in Japan&quot; products and diminishedly the income value pulled by Japanese companies from abroad, because this this one they exchange in national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the Tsunami on the 11th of March which have laid waste the region of Tohoku (north-east), for his reconstruction&quot;, stresses M. Noda which fears this price increase of the yen can kill the weak impetus already in the germ. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third economic world power has won with the growth in the third quarter-1,5% in comparison to the preceding quarter for the first time this year thanks to the fickle Exportzunahmen and the consumption of the households &quot;sealed&quot; by the disaster once more in tractive power. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Nevertheless, the prime minister estimates that the price increase of the yen does not reflect &quot;the economic foundations of Japan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi has asked on his part the bank of Japan of (BoJ) which has opened a 2-day meeting of her currency-political committee on Tuesday to seize all conceivable Maβnahmen to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Nevertheless, Hirohide Yamaguchi, acting governor of the institute, has informed about that, &quot;geeignete Maβnahmen&quot; has already initiated the BoJ with which he allowed to announce that on Wednesday no additional currency relaxation is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October the central bank had raised her state bond buyings by 5,000 milliard yen (47 milliard euros) to erase the 55,000 milliard yen (519 milliard euros) cover amounts which she had used for different purchases of finance titles to flood the liquidity market. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Eurozone: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Interest rates shoot up upwards, stock exchanges make Rückzieher </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The infection risk of the debt crisis continuously undermines the European identification numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> In spite of the office admission of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany the rates of the weak Länders rise continuously further. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> The stock exchanges who are still procured around the stability of the eurozone also drift this Tuesday, 15th of November still a little more in negative fields from. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris lost of the CAC at 10 o&apos;clock 1.4% and fell on 3.064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Dax in Frankfurt decreased about 0.4%, London about 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;On account of the new tensions with regard to the yields of the state loans in the eurozone itself located in difficulties the worldwide stock markets continue publishing a part her kürzlichen profits. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;The investors are aware nervously and to themselves only too well of the infection risk&quot;, explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker with IG Markets, cited by the press agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The stock exchange in Tokyo which suffers for their part from the renewed fear of the market participants concerning the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis further continues had closed with a fall of prices of 0.7%. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;&quot;Japan has directed just as the rest of the world his eyes upon Europe, and trade moves on restricted variation hall, as long as the investors have no proofs of the fact that the situation has stabilised&quot;, Mitsushige Akino, fund governor estimates with Ichiyoshi investment management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> This revival of the concern about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency which continues her Baiss on on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro moves since one and a half months at his lowest level. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> About 10 o&apos;clock the European foreign currency of 1.3570 incredible was worth, she gave way about 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to the stockbrokers she has decreased, after the CDU, party of the chancellor Angela Merkel who had assembled on Monday in the congress to an application had granted which intends in particular the possibility for itself in difficulties located countries to resign from the eurozone without leaving at the same time the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Italian and Spanish rates are far under 6 % borders. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The interest on loans of Italy and Spain is furthermore at very disconcerting level. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> These Tuesday morning achieved ones the yield of the Italian bonds for 10 years 6.85%, that of the Spanish titles matured on 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The fears of the investors feed these tensions of the interest rates in the south countries, but also in France, furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called in the markets more time to restore threatened situation in Italy from paralysis by the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek prime minister Luca dad&apos;s demos had confirmed on his part, the conversion on the occasion of the summit on the 27th of October of the eurozone made decisions are &quot;the major task&quot; of his government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is in the Visir of the markets, because on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The interest scissors (&quot;spread&quot;) between the German and Spanish 10-annual bonds have reached once more a new, historical high. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of growth count of the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Statistically seen France registered an economic growth carried by the budgetary consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, therefore a little better than expected 0.3%. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> However, the statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the fall of prices of the figures of the second quarter, namely with a deficit of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> In truth it is the fourth quarter which disturbs the economic experts mostly. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany had to register on his part for the same period a growth of 0.5%. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The first projection of the whole eurozone is expected at 11 o&apos;clock and the EU commission warns about the risk of a renewed recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts should win over dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If exists a subject that may not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is absolutely the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and costs of the electricity influence the buying power as well as the competition ability of the enterprises in direct Maβe. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take an electoral meeting to the occasion to think about this subject as well as about the position of the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will yield only fruit if it sounds out the totality of economic, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should back up her opinion on objective facts, rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although 7 milliard people are on this planet, the demographic evolution speeds up a duplication of the electric inquiry up to 2050, should not have to renounce a huge portion of the world population a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time one must reduce the shortage of the fossil resources to be able to produce electricity furthermore continuously without forgetting the compelling need for the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate, to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima changes none of these parametres. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Hence, blebt Germany furthermore in his decision isolated to renounce nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is neither the case in Belgium which subjects his decision of the need to find a spare spring capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland which intends just to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil to call only some states her projects pursue against it furthermore with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States have decided for their part to Fukushima to attach an other unity to her park, while they start running the work Three Mile closed after the nuclear accident Iceland once more. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Even if the German model straightened on renewable energy sources is put now and then as a model, nevertheless, the reality contradicts the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a rise in price of the electric price, one by the increased resort on import gas reinforced energetic dependence in particular from Russia, an increase by gas power stations and coal-fired power stations of caused CO2 issues. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The totality of these joyless effects will already become apparent within less months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case Denmark gives occasion for the reflexion. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is on the one hand European league leaders concerning wind energy from which it covers 30% of his electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately uses with wind energy; aufgrunddessen his CO2 outputs as well as his electric price are in each case about 65% and 50% higher than the suitable European average value. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the permanence of our energy policy our neighbours pay an electric calculation 40% higher in contrast to our French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Because the energy price shows a key role of the competition ability as well as a stability security of the industry on national ground in the globalized economy, the französichen enterprises on account of the most favorable electricity in Europe have an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Hence, every significant reduction with regard to the nuclear energy would cause a strong taking of the energy price what would make the noble statements about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defence of the buying power the illusion. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveys proved that it is a price to which the groβe majority of the French is ready to pay just as little as she reveals opposition against the principle of this energy source. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> If we visualise that the energy policy of our country has enabled to build up an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> On account of her strong export character she brings a vast amount of specified smaller and small and medium-sized companies on the international markets and makes these jobs countless to creators. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> Should France make the decision to get out of the nuclear power, a Groβteil this KMU would fall victim, and the annual 6 milliard euros in capital goods and nuclear energy export would shrivel more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which electrician would instruct one to the functioning for sixty years of conceived EPR if the decline of his producer is preprogrammed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energetic equation one must put away that there is a wonder drug to the production of electricity just as little like a devil&apos;s work. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The solutions developed by the company Areva Poor in CO2, for the application of nuclear power and renewable energy testify from the complementary of the energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> The highest possible safety standards are to be maintained for the nuclear power an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a security service which carries out uncompromising and clear controls in already existing works as for example in the construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their working teams which have made a name to themselves on account of her professionalism are just too owned by the security image. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years the core industry has experienced three serious sturgeon cases. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only just one, namely in Three Mile Iceland, has entered under normal operating conditions; thus he ran without consequences for person and environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl the drama became by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure bring on. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> With Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was never caused by two natural disasters of been there magnitude which caused the death of several ten thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The core industry will pull her apprenticeships also from this accident as it had done this after both preceding ones. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation of the security services of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, shows of the EPR a draught which allows robustness compared with such phenomena to him. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Because it is judged among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a building freeze in Flamanville would be a splendid present to the competition of Areva and EDF, while one would leave them free road to tear the leadership position in the unavoidable nuclear power development in himself. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is unavoidable and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country, however, it would be irresponsible to let dominate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate which determines as economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration a load or chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration politics controlled under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from all sorts of corners - strain of police organs, court organs and administrative organs on account of a politics subject to the figures, compatibility of this politics with the status of a &quot;country of the human rights&quot;, as itself France itself had entitled. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> The nuisance directed against foreign students of official side had recently stamped the weekly looking, the Minister of the Interior had announced by the way (see Libération from the 23rd of May) that France needs &quot;no talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this politics was analysed only seldom from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> A far-reaching consensus rules because over this subject between rights and the lefts. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> By right side was struck the note of Jacques Chirac who had explained in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed people, under it more than 2 millions immigrated manpower, no problem for a country might explain&quot;, from left side with Michel Rocard who had demonstrated in 1990, France &quot;cannot take up the whole poverty of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference exists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of the invasion of the national ground by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from the right as well as from the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a load for the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference exists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit to which one is determined to admit towards the immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande limits itself in his programme to banalities which point to it, fair development allows to solve our &quot;migration problems&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This image of immigration as a load, as a problem, can possibly affect the elections; however, she is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> How to us the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron visualise in a recently appeared work which summarises the newest knowledge with regard to the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and wanting Define Our Future, May, 2011, Princeton University Pressing, 352 S.), a wide consensus exists among the specialists concerning the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries with an open immigration policy. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> To limit the immigration the growth would weaken and damage the labour market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears compared with the influence of the migrants are based on the image that these threaten, the local manpower, in particular more slightly qualified to substitute, while they exerted pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Nevertheless, the experience shows that the immigrants are substantially complementarier in truth than as the local wage-labour workers, because they exercise schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors which are job-technically unfully occupied. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The slightly certified immigrants work in sectors which local wage-labour workers irritate a little, more certified among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the education is not adapted to the vacancies. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive wage effect </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Just as a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country in which a lack of anaesthetists rules, this complementary also causes a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation between local and migrant. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that 1 %-iger increase of the immigrant flood causes an incorporated, long-term rise of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without consideration of the fact that the variety introduced by the immigrants of the idea creation as well as the economic growth is good (high portion of established immigrants among American Nobel Prize Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on an average possibly at a height of 1% of the overall budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The world labour organisation estimates, for example, that one introduces immigrating person in the public household on average for his lifetime a net contribution (income minus issues) from about the 150,000 euros at the age of 30 years to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wished to cause the missing intersections &quot;with the teeth&quot; to beginning of his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Nevertheless, these aforesaid teeth which the immigrants should deter achieved exactly the contrary effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented the democracy, now remains to think through the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable property; also a sensitive property. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember itself it who left after her invention in Athens more than 2000 years ago the whole 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, the totalitarianism, the Holocaustes, the gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece about himself. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some had thought fine, it manages on exercising the right to vote, namely in direktest possible way to see winning the democracy one for all spot about her enemies. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> One knows since Napoleon &quot;to the little one&quot; that it concerned a sign of the mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general franchise which shows necessary condition of the democracy is not for this a sufficient condition and can become as well the &quot;suppression instrument&quot; as it at that time the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organisation, separation and control of the powers, an education, clarification, economic and social community spirit, an administration of justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe in which we are is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and first of all a politics and democracy crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The change of heart of the Greek true-wrong referendum would have had twice informative character in this regard: once of the need of a powerful return of the politics, on the other side, however, also that of the disconcerting feeling of their impossibility, her Unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be judged as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that today the front lines of the democratic fight have shifted, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most from them, aim not more in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have to win nothing to press for a success of the domestic referendum which was organised in dependence of the needs and in wrong order. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free light for the European autocrat or a jump with linked eyes in the emptiness of the nationalistic retreat: A groβartige choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want cleaver, but a collective job, from full right, mellow and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know, for the rest, already any more, where to finish the enumeration - because there is only one single crisis, and this rules in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe which bends to the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies which suffers from his faint and his solidarity lack. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe which is humiliated at international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> One is disturbed about sovereignty transfer in the direction of Europe - besides, it is the whole of Europe which loses bit by bit his sovereignty and with it every single one of the nations attached to him. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency consists in giving the guidance of the European project back to the hand to the national sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Since it has lain in the totality whether the Europeans reduce the load of her debts, from the markets can free themselves and initiate a future by investments. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The climbing out from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition which can be liked not without complete democratic Rechtmäβigkeit without leading us definitely in the downfall. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the socialists long time about, today everybody pushes the European economic guidance in addition. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But itself this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it the citizens have in mind - to introduce would be a renewed folly and an other dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new stage of European construction on ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To let arise the republic in France, it required the fact &quot;to create&quot; Republican. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of the interests only could not perform here is enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction remains valid furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must form Europe better integrated at economic level. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can be only reached, while one creates political Europe more democratic seen, a really European national sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We need European to create Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Cards with electronic chip &quot;without contact&quot; become the common property </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The world fair for cards with electronic chip opens on Tuesday in Villepinte close Paris in optimistic position her gates. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> 2011 had to go according to eurosmart, actually, with 11 %-igen increases of worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC-cards, SIM map phone) end, with more than 6 milliards sold units. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The most carrying segment is allowed, on this occasion, the technology without contact, the payments in public means of transportation or settlement by purchases, while one quite simply holds the map near a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Compared with a year before sold 320 millions 460 millions cards with electronic chip without contact should be sold this year worldwide! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share of the market should increase in 2012 even further (580 millions expected units) and more than 10% of the global card with electronic chip market (6,925 million maps) perform official duties. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe gains ground concerning the payment without contact, after it is limped behind long time of the region the Asia Pacific. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million visa maps are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept this. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France the beginnings are rather give: Only 400,000 visa maps without contact were spread. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Nevertheless, the hypermarkets make steam. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Hence, Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 millions passports without contact MasterCards. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To go over of too higher speed, now it is necessary that the banks equip her customers with these maps. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two groβe French financial institutions have undertaken to hand over bank maps to her customers in future systematically who are equipped with chip without contact&quot;, Gérard Nébouy, general manager of visas Europe France announces. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment on mobile phone </seg>

<seg id="2796"> Terrorist front gets on, from the Sahara to Nigeria </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is disturbed about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The relations already long standing under suspicion between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday the Algerian Vize-Auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel had confirmed itself that Algiers has now about that &quot;certainty attained&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way with which both organisations go forward as well as the relations of the Secret Services point to a clear cooperation&quot; he declared without next in the detail to go. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to make a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The inquiries about the kidnapping taken place in the last January of two French in Niger has promoted interfaces by days. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In a restaurant in Niamey of followers of the Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have become on the next day the same time like several her kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units getöten. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the remains in the place of action several phone chips which belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the controlled phone phone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, in Niger as well as in Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to radio France international (RFI) the investigators interest in particular the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed long time in Maiduguri, a town in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is valid as the Aqmi and the champagnes close. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is a progress, nevertheless, one must wait undoubtedly for more unequivocal documents, before one can speak of a surgical cooperation between Aqmi and Boko harem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;However, it is conceivable&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;One knows for many years that the sect covers financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that this is active increasingly&quot;, the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo tones down. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> During these last months these &quot;support achievements&quot; have become more and more obvious in her course, also the addresses as well as the operation modes of Boko harem which point now to consulting of suicide assassins as well as the application of always complicated growing explosives which carry the same manuscript like those which were used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community to start near Washington has exerted pressure on Abuja since this time, so that one takes into account there for the problems caused by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have judged the grouping, indeed, long time about as a community of Illuminaten which must be given no special attention. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Quick success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> In 2002 in Maiduguri in surroundings of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - what means in Haoussa so much as &quot;the western education is a disgrace&quot; - the establishment of an Islamic emirate pursues in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this impecunious region the union finds out rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> She politicises herself and claims strict observance of the sharia, while they exert themselves her attached activist in the fight against the ungodly central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in the visor. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009 the activists of Boko Haram with her reinforced attacks against the commissioner&apos;s offices were especially active. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> Nevertheless, the reaction on the part of Abuja is as normally indifferenziert. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army surrounds the town, one counts 800 dead people. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf taken in captivity is killed in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Consequently the sect becomes visibly more radical and leaves her strongholds in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> The last Christmas she confessed to an attempt in Jos which demanded 80 human lives then to next in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June Boko Haram the guilt of a suicide attempt is assigned which occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - first to his kind. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August the local seat of the United Nations gets to the priority international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The education of a terrorist axis in Africa which should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to there to Somalia disturbs since then all security experts. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have taken which Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko harem seems to be a new menace in the centre of the continent. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> Is able to do crisis-weak America a complicated world with easy not to say: to simple-minded ideas lead? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> If one listens to the republican presidential candidates in such a way, the voters could get almost this impression. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For a few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrade-in-arms let her thundering explanations as well as her statements with regard to the Auβenpolitik, to traditional republican main focus, repeatedly announce. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Over China, Iran and the Israel help fall - often underpinned in keinster manner - slogans. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Concerning the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old of party&quot; highest in the course standing Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before WTO and them of the &quot;currency manipulation&quot; - leading subject in America that is irritated by the drift of whole industrial branches to Asia on the Äuβerste - to accuse. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Stupidly tired if this should imply initiating a commercial war he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβenpolitik has cut off to himself nearly concerning his behaviour flattering the emotions the air. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He had appealed for a sturdy, but constructive conversation exchange with Peking (also the topical position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman is not heard, because he stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Reagan&apos;s image </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney had promised also military blows against Iran, if the sanctions should fail to the Stoppung of the nuclear programme. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am chosen, I order to Iran stop&quot;, he had sounded. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Auβerdem he has promised to Israel reinforced military help and has accused Obama of having remained guilty to this partner compared with obligations. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The enterpriser Herman Cain, zweithöchst placed candidate, carries on his part an embarrassing act unawareness to the show. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently he appealed for giving Against to the Chinese military menace, there Peking &quot;tries to develop a nuclear power&quot; - and, besides, left the fact auβer eight that China is already since 1964 in the possession of military atomic weapons! </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texan governor Rick Perry who supports Israel and demands military blows against Iran to be ready äuβert on his part, to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The resort prohibited by Obama in 2009 on Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also recommended by Cain, Perry as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> One is far away from John McCain, to the republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitischen heavyweight. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> The topical presidency opponents against, Reagan has won also easy images and in spite of all that the cold war. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that also Obama is same stone amateur and had to give water in his wine what concerned the subject Anti-terror. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They rightly persist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature deduction of his &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his indecision in Libya what also introduced the call of the weakness in him. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> However, this hostility is not so unconstrained completely. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population estimates rather the positive balance of the national security under Obama which bin Laden has switched off. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> Since Iraq she watches out for the military interventions which lead for tiring. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> The north Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas long-distance line the north Stream which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia was put in company. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> She should deliver gas for a recompense of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with shine and Gloria. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 loaded guests, under it four heads of state and heads of government, have been present the last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestra acoustic irradiation and by gourmet&apos;s refreshment bar of the inauguration of the new gas long-distance line the north Stream which connects Russia and Germany under the sea level directly with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister Françoi Fillon as well as his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have turned symbolic-wise together the controls of the valve which carry the Russian gas in the west-European net. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new gas long-distance line 27.5 milliard cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year should be delivered by the first conduit of 1.224-km length which connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-West Pomerania to Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> The second conduit which permits a whole delivery of 55 milliard cubic metres of gas - to the recompense of the French whole consumption - should be finished in the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And one already lets the eventuality of the construction of the third management on the same distance be reminiscent. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom the timely and point-exact completion of this huge building works like a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was very argumentative in Poland and the Baltic states. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The north Stream pipeline will allow because a direct gas delivery to Germany, namely under avoidance any route course by third countries (Poland or the Ukraine) on the country road. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason these both countries lose a little of her power: Now for them it becomes more difficult to exert pressure on Russia, while they threaten to close the admission to west-European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, strongest in the debate engaged, had not shied away to compare the north Stream pipeline to &quot;new German sowietischen pact&quot; in binding to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the subject is sensitive politically seen äuβerst. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has won by the support of this Russian project an even higher security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> This energy nevertheless European at the expenses of a weakening, because the project has hit a breach between West European and Eastern European. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has finished it in hardly five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries which show strong gas consumption and whose gas occurence goes to the bending of putting through. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas long-distance line is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which connects us in organic way&quot;, confirmed François Fillon by the inauguration of the gas long-distance line, while he pointed to it in which degree the groβen gas contracts are also important from political and true side. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers numerously represented in Lubmin concerning the gas inlet. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas long-distance line is also a prominent technology. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The unterwater pipe exists of steel with concrete sheath which it should protect against ship anchoring. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> She rests on the seabed, in about 200-m depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> By her construction had to become from the Second World War to dating mine fields made way. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;About hundreds of mines had to be removed as a precaution or be destroyed&quot;, bragged Jens Müller, speaker of the society the north Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Auβerdem had to be seized reinforced Maβnahmen for the protection of the fauna and flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The management is a long queue from metal, difficult like 242 Eiffeltürme who is interrupted about the whole length by nothing: neither by valves, nor servicing stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A controlling platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, however, the project persons responsible have refrained from it, because the Swedes were keen a little to see settling a Russian state society in permanent way on height of her coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of an average we close the gas passage at less than one minute&quot;, specified Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of a leakage the gas itself located in the gas long-distance line escapes in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is probably looked by the designers, nevertheless, as only a little, because the Schweiβnähte were estimated at a permanence of a leakage per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The state supervision of the gas long-distance line is guaranteed by an underwater robot which is steered for external observation purposes from a sea ship, as well as from a device which circulates inside of the gas long-distance line. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It owns the form of a cigar, miβt 1 metre of diameter, is introduced in the inside of the conduit and is moved by the gas pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three entire days of the locomotion by the management with a speed of 3 metres per second, the device with his arrival delivers the most exact information about possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas long-distance line was conceived to function during fifty years without having to be submitted even to the slightest repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gas circulation is quite simply guaranteed by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This amounts to 200 cash in the admission, 100 cash in the discharge position. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five societies have united for the realisation of this project her forces. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Nevertheless, the management guidance remains in the hand of Gazprom which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Furthermore are here the German societies of E. ON and BASF attached (to 15.5%), just as the Dutch gas-university and the French company group GDF Suez (to 9%). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five societies have formed an enterprise community which is called the north Stream and is instructed with the construction as well as company of the gas long-distance line. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> She has her seat in train in Switzerland where the taxation is especially favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom has rented then of this society the whole capacity of her gas transport, namely on extendable twenty-year contract. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the whole capacity, all the same as gro β it transports honestly gas amount precipitates&quot;, specified Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the gas distant line construction was secured to 30% by stockholders as well as to 70% by bank loan. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The whole labour cost should amount to 7.4 milliard euros for both conduits. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez the investment sum amounted, for example, to 240 millions. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> Nevertheless, the minority stockholders are gewi β to bring again her displays, because Gazprom carries only the liabilty risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas long-distance line kicks in a sandy, with pines wooded coastal line with Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas escape gate. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the arriving gas, before this is passed on in the German gas long-distance lines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since the last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing by hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> With full capacity there would be this 3 million cubic metres per hour as well as 6 millions in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a brand notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Now brought to life from an Italian enterprise about fifteen years ago, Moleskine would like to lend new style to the writing again. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an atmosphere of adventure, with candle-light with the writing spent hours. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook of Moleskine is recognizable easily again, with his black, rectangular book cover, his elastic band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, how during the time aged. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Today the Moleskine notebook, how one it knows, nevertheless, has originated in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian enterprise of Modo Modo which has his seat in Milan decided to put on the market at that time a distinguished design notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, at that time technical adviser of the enterprise, is instructed with the market launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook became from a traditional production technology, called mole Skin (mole skin) inspired which calls a Baumwollack which is used, for example, for relations by settees. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This kind of notebook was asked among authors and travellers very much. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has animated an old and almost forgotten object which was valid till the 20th century as an icon of avant-garde artists&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand person responsible with Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success enters. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010 the sales rise by 26% and set up with sales of 12.7 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> This is far away from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine passes the Italian border and is explained in 70 countries, namely from France up to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, because the notebook inspires also businessmen as well as students and experts. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-spiritual customers. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Today the small, Italian enterprise which counted 12 employees in his beginnings occupies more than 100 employees and orders since 2008 more than two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> The enterprise expels his notebooks in bookstores, on Internet main entrances like Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and gets on how to put through his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We are followed the spirit of the times and his new stationary which exists in spite of the impetus of e-mails&quot;, explained Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: The brand has recently launched an exposition called &quot;Detour (detour)&quot; in which architects and artists issued her own notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August the enterprise on the occasion of the film festival in Lucerne also put on the market a book cover with leopard&apos;s pattern. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine profited from his success and this cultural spirit of the times and knew how to diversify his products: Pockets, appointment calendars, fountain pens, computer covers... The brand shows the whole range of articles. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success, the envious person on the plan brings: In autumn, 2006 became Modo Modo of the investment ground SG Capital Europe, the today&apos;s Syntegra Capital bought up, and whipped with it a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Which is why does the rate of unemployment of handicapped employed persons remain open to so high level? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of the handicapped people are on search for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today the &quot;15th week of the work begins for disabled persons&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> In spite of a purposeful public politics which was introduced in 2005 the rate of unemployment is always twice as high with handicapped people than the average average: 19% against 9% Arbeitlosigkeit of the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Disheartening? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, so emphatically Éric Blanchet, general manager of the union Adapt which straightens the &quot;week of the work for disabled persons&quot; &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress achieved within fifteen years is substantial.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time the rate of unemployment was not double, but three times higher.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Still remains nevertheless terrifically a lot to act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Nevertheless, one is said that for handicapped unemployed people furthermore numerous obstacles survive, before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More often it meets the old people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They dispose of a low qualification level: 80% of them have no Abitur and it only 10,000 disabled persons are less than the 2.3 million students with higher educational end. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% with the disabled persons compared with 38% in the whole cut. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short there are so many criteria which complicate a renewed working entrance, and which form the &quot;core of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, a union founded in 1992 which helps for enterprise, besides to enlist handicapped employed persons. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much to the objective brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> If the unspoken, the mentalities, to itself remains though indeed, but slowly further developing. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> One in April of the union IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité carried out study bragged, the questioned managers have &quot;a weak knowledge level with regard to disabled persons&quot;, &quot;überrepräsentiert&quot; is &quot;from people in wheel chairs, psychically or intellectually less-wealthy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have to achieve a wide way before themselves, around the employment aim of 6% of handicapped employed persons which was established in a law of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> These last-named, from 2008 to coming figures refer to a quotient of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now we are with about 3%&quot;, reports Pierre Blanc, general manager about Agefiph, the organisation which is asked to drive contributions of enterprise which ignore this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof: The number &quot;fees more paying&quot; company sites has decreased just as the sum of the deposited amounts between 2007 and 2011, namely zahlenmäβig from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of the 2005 which intends increases in contributions created a strong pressure on the enterprises, explained Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge in particular with the groβen company groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the ministry of work only 59% of the company sites between 20 and 49 employees occupy handicapped employed persons, enterprises with from 100 to 199 employees against it 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What luck&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Already before they offered the forehead to &quot;blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 o&apos;clock), had not concealed from Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens her pleasure which brought them the friendly game. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It would be taken too far to state, there has been a secret consent between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Side by side on the spectator&apos;s platform of Stade de France seated peace could have closed George Leekens and Eden Hazard well and with pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the spirited gesture of his striker against Turkey the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise with regard to his person. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I am very contented with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I would like to look forwards&quot;, assures the Liller by birth on his part. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> What the contrast between his representation in club and soccer national team &quot;It concerns is a unity, this justifies everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille I am all year round what is not the case in Belgium&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;It is a time for me to go to the start&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, caused Friday evening against Romania concerning the match against France &quot;to shine&quot; finally. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without omitting, nevertheless, from the mark of the &quot;pleasure&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> He fires the French national team since the age of 7 years, he conducted his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I was always supported&quot;, he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This serves necessarily to strengthen the &quot;unique&quot; character of this meeting even more. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> So much in advance: &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) und Adil (Rami) werden dabeisein&quot;, he visualises. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We have tired ourselves just above the way&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;To be allowed to play against them means groβes luck!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Leekens let on his part with good nature &quot;pride&quot; be reminiscent. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Der Stolz, ein Galamatch&quot; auszutragen. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> To confirm &quot;proudly&quot; also around - in his quality as &quot;neighbours&quot; - that France &quot;again has become a team at very high level&quot;, and a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
