<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Centre Brennan sees it as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments from 2009 passed new laws making it more difficult the registration process or to vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained momentum after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the single year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of polls, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and withdraw to citizens with a criminal record their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities clamoured to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such an ID. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of 18-29 year olds do not have the required photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students, more voters considered voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Prior to 2004, no state requires proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have helped to save about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped by 17%, the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted at advance polls were African-Americans, while they represented only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same was true with Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, the whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of the electorate voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate-General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounced the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in key states in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to get tested. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one, found a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who do not have. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test starting at age 50, or from 40 years if it was a parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The African-American men are also at greater risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to understand the degree of risk to the patient&apos;s cancer, by offering options, does not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect the long-term life, and opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will suggest to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it will accurately determine the criteria to decide who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether or not it should go. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no easy way to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles, remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several also remain totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is highly detrimental to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging information: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommends to reduce consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too much, it raises the risk of developing colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages, too, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, are not conclusive at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Pass a screening test, it does not give cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson husked </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson likely has created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;least worst&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure whether the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a genuine new particle, and it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data released this week at a major conference of physics, Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be absolutely sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose all the same whether the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong are slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law inevitably unavoidable that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you&apos;re going to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="114"> However, even if particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that she, too, has a law of this kind: The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - the state &quot;consisting of roughly in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the particle physicists fall into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other are bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: The mesons, which we do not discuss here, and the &quot;force particles,&quot; in which the main forces of nature spread and that the Higgs is somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all bugs as exotic as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to an extraordinary banality boson: The photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it disturb the electromagnetic field in this specific location, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared or ultraviolet, etc), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus a &quot;force carriers bosons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true with the Higgs boson, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; that the boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; pour l&apos;exciter, there is very, very high energies, just as if it were a frozen pond that only a very large rock could ride the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator such as CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> These are not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like the magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, does not hold itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: Those that do have mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what does &quot;can make&quot; all of this research, asked Senator Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also enables physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also more fervently hope that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes in the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which form about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we found no such differences at CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research into the daily life of Mr and Mrs Tout-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Consider: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, at Bell Laboratories, did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw the scientific applications, but nothing of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (pulsed) were the first, in 1962, the laser was initially seen as a &quot;gadget lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not at all its original intent, now serves as &quot;eye&quot; to all digital cameras in the world, and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his Commission to die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will resume shortly, while a bill is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this vital area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to look more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. was still living alone in her apartment in the Montérégie region. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer who gnawed had left a break of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago,&quot; he says, half-mixed, lying in his bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s still a shock, it may not be prepared for it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is his work: A huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat before a delicious lunch, he agrees to get help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him, give him his medication, offered him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I will cure diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man piss standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the person&apos;s ability to accept the regression,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are at the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life up to three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called curative care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die &quot;conscious and stifled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer wishes in life,&quot; she says, before accepting that he is a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It looked all the same, in the next few days, a last visit to his son come to Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor-Gadbois, it provides, together with a group of volunteers, care of the body and food aid. </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are palliative care, which is when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, there are a palliative care bed for 11 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when you know that eventually you die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, &quot;explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> In the dying, it will provide care to the mouth of brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, it was served a beer to Mr X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who will complete beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It helps the relatives as well as patients,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Home Victor-Gadbois, the days go by but do not resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> With a 93-year-old man who is relishing his final assembly of family in the yard, well cushioned in pillows while it is falling in his honour, a 36-year-old boy has died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47% are from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is treatment designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and home palliative care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in the Quebec health care concern to several doctors who specialize in palliative care, the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, signed a manifesto of palliative care experts including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before agreeing to perform euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without the necessary to relieve her. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients are eager to die because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I would have to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop to beat me, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Yet, she had told me that I was finished! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients who ask to die thank caregivers not to have acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home palliative care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors have often resorted to palliative sedation, which is tantamount to sedate the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient is not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you euthanasiiez me,&quot; it means &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report was made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Highway officials, contractors, fundraisers for political parties and the Italian Mafia experts tell day after day what they know of a formidable &quot;system,&quot; involving the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that has been very costly to taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious as the system crumbles since they took the major means,&quot; &quot;Jacques Duchesneau, former MP in Quebec City and Montreal police chief. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through a background investigation on embezzlement related to road construction contracts in Quebec, in which the Liberal premier, Jean Charest, did so only begrudgingly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;The report Duchesneau was a direct link between industry, financial underpinnings of parties and corruption of public officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he noted, the Department of Transportation would have saved only $1 billion on contracts,&quot; some réfrénant their instincts to reach a share! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he says, hoping that it will be able to &quot;demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The ongoing anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts across the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Most members of the squad &quot;Hammer,&quot; which, since 2009, would have led the &quot;Montreal&quot; cartel sewers to apply the brake on the swelling of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, she has conducted searches in series and laid charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank zampino a déclaré and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is alleged to have pocketed bribes of repeatedly in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Moreover, are formally accused of the Montreal road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> He caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal at an intermediate linked to the mafia who reversait money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals, in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He confessed also have organized an illegal fund-raising for the Former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts which he inflated costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was functioning smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles surprenant, former public works engineer, has detailed well before the committee: In ten years, he has received from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736 million, in exchange for sewer contracts which he inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other road officials have confessed to having grease the leg by inflating from 30% to 40% of invoices, false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Tremblay was accused of deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding its coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, she said that she &quot;draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but there should be a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, not to see the return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but expressed particular concern about the role of &quot;elected officials aware of the ploy,&quot; when they don&apos;t dipped in deception! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating that 70% share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec, it is ironic: &quot;I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government is proposing to limit to $100 donations to parties, but this will not change the situation, he said: &quot;As long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and financing of parties: &quot;You can&apos;t go below and get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on a firmer footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story has tarnished the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own back yard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progression? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by an individual&apos;s awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I was at their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also contributed a great deal to me. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Every day, these elements lead me to raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not ignite. </seg>
<seg id="261"> In my early days at the center of preformation of the INF Clairefontaine in my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by levels. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Therefore, you can take advantage of competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer&apos;s recruits are accustomed to play games of a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> What makes a player like me want to respond and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience and has won a lot of titles with exclusive clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a discussion with him comforting. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I went out of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> It gives me confidence also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> How do you see on the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarter-finals with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to finish first in our pool, to Porto, in order to receive at the 8th finals return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG can it become a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It has already the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and long-lasting. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to make this happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it was really committed to pocket the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it is not gone away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because it had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Has been a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Was finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has done a season even more fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think the media are waiting too much? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that you expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It accepts it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to blame us, it is certain that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> You can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We&apos;re trying to set up a game project. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was shown in the Champions League that we could be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the quarter-finals, they also made huge expenditures! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the money invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead at the truce! </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been inspired by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in the month of May we will have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevailed. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&apos;s exploits. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much better that we say that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It has come to this and it proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He has shown wherever he went he was a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you lived the Euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had committed to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to glean game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I have emerged stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I can achieve good matches selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I was hoping since my baptism with the Blues. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and now needs to have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How do you see on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had achieved its goal in qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good one (1-1), on 16 October, Spain is a founding game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each has fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and processing fees among stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a protocol for the secure exchange of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course of the bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies issued in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She described as &quot;the virtual currency bitcoin having the most success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as &quot;credits,&quot; used to make progress in a video game is won by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time, a central authority control and trade deals. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins existed in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a file hash phase, that is, processing a large file into a single digital footprint and shorter. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number of &quot;chop&quot; before the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that gives a special imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that this is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other being an orphan because both have different fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until one hundred millionth, leaving the room... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Life of the network has already had its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and robbed in bitcoins deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The flaw used is not the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real money using the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also identifies opportunities for money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Serious players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;giants&quot; balances have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts gold bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier operates over its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They only need to provide an address, a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in his report, intended to reassess the risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We started from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> These are mostly Afghan farmers that we punished by treating them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former heads of refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign forces, such as during Soviet times. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will not be when Westerners will be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops of the Nijrab base, which I watched from the hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country ablaze because of the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, the current Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They became wheeler-dealers, taking up government land for resale in building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, running huge US outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are stigmatized; most of them have not even fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, yearn for a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: Capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will provide work for these young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its Turkish soap operas that have a modern world is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities that the order will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already rebuilding of provincial militias, which will escape the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to enjoy a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform it into a centralised state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly during the elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country has, since the 1950s, and already well before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been restarted, there is no dam, no major irrigation system is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that Westerners were there only to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat iron ore and copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the My Afghanistan&apos;s huge Aynak Copper Mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will one day also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of the French troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: High school girls, boys, Department of English at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the fields of military, legal, medical and agricultural support for the Archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and achieve the impossible task of matching grants and offensive actions, &quot;a civil-military actions&quot; by the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, led, and carried out by a small French NGO, many public works and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, requiring local workforce, were able to help contain the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivation. </seg>
<seg id="447"> That will leave us as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To break free of the insurgency waged by foreign groups, what farmers have told me, it should be kept in their favour a small civilian assistance, well-controlled and that directly affects them. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution the forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him temporarily full powers, he decided to play everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months in this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> For almost two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text amended several times which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, he perseveres in his &quot;autocratic style,&quot; continuing to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trampling the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a means to an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to abandon their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic, while the dispute raged across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Since this is a hasty vote on the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers,&quot; they would supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the liberals were missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they have not been able to express their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="469"> To ensure that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, substitute members, have been added in haste, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators have also amused that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was poorly resolved. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, includes 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stating that &quot;the principles of sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace &quot;principles&quot; by &quot;the rules,&quot; which would have allowed for stricter enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; replied the liberals, who only see it as a blow of communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify the conformity of laws with sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because &quot;people need to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The Liberals&apos; fears are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the state. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some trained in the French system &quot;moderates Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he acknowledges that &quot;there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the words borrowed religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It refers to the &quot;fiqh&quot; including [Islamic jurisprudence, ed]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question could arise in the future to what extent of civilian judges are competent to rule on it. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is widely criticized because of the powers it grants the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another point of contention: The powers given to the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Defence Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Nor will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> They are also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem liberticidal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, freedom of the press in particular. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Moreover, no article is no longer echo the protection of women, &quot;said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>

<seg id="585"> 118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="586"> &quot;That language has, in Moscow will&quot;: Migrants save money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPs and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling &quot;false&quot; certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their sole purpose: To earn money to help their families at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December, a law came into force, and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, personal services and retail sales. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, promised the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law. </seg>
<seg id="595"> We will have to validate their language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Are free only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> People who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of Saint Petersburg, and other institutions of higher education in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in cities across the country: More than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce exams was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: What is it will give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, meet representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from slavery &quot;at work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Much talk of defending the rights of migrant workers, &quot;says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organized selection system will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, will provide a &quot;trip&quot; in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellow tourmenteront go for months without food and without paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected wage,&quot; confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I don&apos;t argue, the policeman! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come to earn money in Russia said they did not know not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it is not their fault, but their misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to take even a fair primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when you don&apos;t know the language, they entrust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel diminished and diminished.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Defenders of human rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The reviews will be designed only to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome to enter&quot; or defence </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, the legalization costs money: Between 12 and 16 miles rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you can get a false registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police officers know that we have forged documents, that we have no registration, where cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; confided to reporters Umed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Do quickly, without skimping and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> On the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the migrants&apos; registration papers were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Falsified papers out of a regular color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: It will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of power and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption to make it impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give to migrant workers who were not able to validate the test for the first time to take language courses. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior is not the arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against the civilian weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: Whether fire at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the firearm permit from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who has promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma soon. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everyone is not happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;tightening the screws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, demand to abandon this senseless &quot;hardening.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, told the Russian Service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, on a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of laws regarding civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from gaining access to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From the factory to the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapons is provided via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are five, &quot;says Viktor Baranets, a retired colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot from a site taking orders of </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is the &quot;military record,&quot; that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,&quot; said Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons from the black market are stolen by criminals to the police. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is both stocks of weapons stolen from the police than those stolen directly to law enforcement officials. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal guns go on sale since the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of them have often suffered explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Certified versions indicate that some of the fires were started deliberately to hide the deficit,&quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="663"> To Baranets, arms manufacturers are there for a reason. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;You see private weapons factories that don&apos;t compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow,&quot; says one expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A significant part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mafia was formed and organizes the supply,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for problem analysis and study in public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public information portals relating to weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explained, comes from the army and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons on the black market was found &quot;for lack of employees whose work is related to weapons,&quot; explained in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from &quot;clandestine excavations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="675"> A vendor and an armoury consultant who asked to remain anonymous ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in illegal searches; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Most often, he said, sellers will look for new military goods in warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys through a taught a unit, for example a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The book on him in passing the goods through a mesh screen. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;It is in the city and sells it to 900 €per unit with two magazines,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, for example, when crimes are about to be clarified, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers,&quot; says the seller. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxury boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are generally through knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy comes and offers me to come to the station of Begovaya where someone became take me in a &quot;corner&quot; to bargain. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, I was given on the spot </seg>
<seg id="685"> Viktor Baranets military observer in </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, it is necessary that I know someone who has a contact, &quot;says the seller. I know someone, but I don&apos;t trust it. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the market, but there should also come in saying, for example, &quot;From the part of this person, who asked me to convey that her daughter had lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy a pair of American fists with a person to whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> I am the only book to me because he knows that I do not give it. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The new look for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former soldier Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Patterns, according to him, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given a photo album in which there was &quot;anything you want.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I thought I was in a luxury boutique,&quot; remembers the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is no secret to the buyer, &quot;said Baranets, you can try anything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As a potential customer, I am not content to buy, it goes with the seller in the forest and installing a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They let me take and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, it begins to negotiate,&quot; describes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A shop since his </seg>
<seg id="699"> Search engines are the sites and groups on every where you can buy weapons &quot;for different uses.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> To do this, it needs no document and person to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It is enough to have a specific amount of money,&quot; they wrote in advertising on the site &quot;Buy a pistol or a submachine gun battle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> Users can leave their request and pose their questions. </seg>

<seg id="722"> United States: Employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier&apos;s job at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or diminish rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest wage increases that workers receive basic at Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when a flood of rain balances seizing million inhabitants has befallen America and sometimes triggering clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organize picket lines with unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are aimed at small and medium class consumers. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the big supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> This is why many low-paid workers at Walmart shop solely on their place of work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of products made from Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap in part because of low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants of the events of the &quot;Black Friday&quot; asked for a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the basic wage earner at Walmart affecting 9.5 $per hour, that is a sum that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is 1.1% more than what it currently spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred any wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would amount to 46 cents. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in just one year more than $12.39 now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine states and have brought no harm to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in stores from 8: 00 in the evening until midnight the next day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its made a total of 100 million transactions for the &quot;Black Friday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="747"> The society&apos;s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the site of the left Huffington Post that &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was merely a &quot;com&quot; operation &quot;by the union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Next customer!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York and were not Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of servings and after they don&apos;t even give you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage under federal law and New York is $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast-food outlets are increasing over time, but little on average basic employees in New York $8.90 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody is less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this amount in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost one-quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald&apos;s after high school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald&apos;s employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal newspaper&apos;s forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 near the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue required that cashiers and the fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also sought to set up trade unions in the fast food sector. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration rarely simplifies their life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the key is the extraordinary staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They are not agree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of servings and after they don&apos;t even give you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you have done honestly!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we must all support the fast food employees so they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important in the fast-food sector throughout its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people attended and that not all were employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> For the moment, it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, it is only moderately to deceive the brain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Recently, fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Initially, it is Google, which unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference in November, it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technology Microsoft&apos;s lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, through the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could you tell us in a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole has remained at the moment to the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes touch. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What we also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, many things are happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on a real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including the projection technologies. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to move the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> To begin with, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the voice commands? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but is it not overstated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> We cannot say that this is a panacea: The issue of confidentiality arises because we don&apos;t always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete gestures, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: Gesture + votes. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - It is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you ask me to this can you? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would with the floor and with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually, I spoke only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So, you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can and cannot do at a given time? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth, and this is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you do not like in modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack the resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get about 8-megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c / s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the cameras themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In relation to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, it adds to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> We must bear in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is also very much, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c / s does not really enough, especially for those actions. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond has given to the touch sensors regular delayed treatment between 1 and 100 µs, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everyone does not understand how it influences the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would have needed such a device in my work, but not requiring to touch, to have more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But is it not increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is in fact a normal sensor of the field visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A lot of cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations required. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but here&apos;s what I think: The best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality that you would from a cloud platform to glasses in the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device, and that makes their strength (personal items are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: The augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is an issue on which opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: There is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands don&apos;t feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepare in relation to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a medium. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is perfectly the pressures! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually designed to assign the palpability these images &quot;in the air&quot;: For example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed at a specific point the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breath of air on the fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the bracelets worn on the wrist that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him believe that he feels that he would normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task here below on which it will take a long time to have difficulty: How to believe in someone who is physically located in a very small space that it works in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, it is only moderately to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: A lot of things are still in a state of fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;The Petersburg avant-garde&quot; dedicated to city dwellers who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and the arts. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This ultra-selective list has already hosted leading actors in the art scene in Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new heroes of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, dressed in red that you can sit near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden and parties and openings plugged. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller always bring crowds, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the storytellers St. Petersburg inherently social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and puts them in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took in his hands a barrel organ, and it has become the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his life, his philosophy and his bohemian image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why do you run the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the red as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, everything that is not grey is a negative agitation and aggression. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to start the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy the whereabouts of my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of unofficial painters had grown old and new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then there has been no wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of Saint Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took took place at Pushkinskaya-10 home before the work a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemians. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I can still see Chnour arrive with the project &quot;The Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang songs easy during playback in skinny suits, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer fashionable today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to happen live, it became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg animated quite emissions before the era of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that he received them. </seg>
<seg id="876"> D137 &quot;clowns,&quot; &quot;Griboedov Club&quot;: The impact of the artistic Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are gone as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, the time when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: It was the price &quot;The personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was named &quot;Painter of the year,&quot; and it was then that my reign has ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currency and acute. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibit &quot;The Russian museum through the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it&apos;s scary to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the total disguise and mandatory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress that is important, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Maybe you can&apos;t give him a hand, but rather that it must spit in the mug. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be erased by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Recently we&apos;ve seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But perhaps the commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, sweet wine. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of the bohemian liked one thing, another corny. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, we need to think about who you&apos;re going. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But many thousands of people come to see STAS Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - These are people that were thrown to come see it, it is the social and sexual side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it is less management, money, everything is dying. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the tables that usually are those that are painted at the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, the ideas are often confused. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It said: There is a spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused the money for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing in Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - A good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: The official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone can work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of Tsars, it wasn&apos;t like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in Saint Petersburg who may be experts, but they are left out, because it is higher experts who will evaluate correctly these experts and pave a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot; that flowers. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, there are painters who need to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is it is Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, the art is hard to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have more writers and readers, it&apos;s bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious who will see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, this is a very thin layer. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make art in fashion as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>

<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a big question arises: How to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or relief on a planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two true planets that you can conquer, if only by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;This is Venus and Mars,&quot; said Vladimir mute, researcher at the Astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If the conditions on Mars are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> We cannot live at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It has begun to address issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a half-century, it was conducting experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit were in no way earth varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, it was put into orbit insects, small flies breeding fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs have been sent into space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get out a chick perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a medium, it must be put on its feet and start moving,&quot; says the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir air. </seg>
<seg id="950"> There is no support in the chicks flapping in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours, the new born saw their instincts completely atrophy. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks do not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they died just after four days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We now offer our eyes twice, and then we abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,&quot; said Vladimir air by noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;organic&quot; miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; spacecraft will carry that species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it has discovered nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience. We need to do this kind of research,&quot; said Vladimir air. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats have given birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it does not yet to make reproductions directly into space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to fulfill their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional substance. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women are going into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity&apos;s most precious asset. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The gull flew and no one on Earth could not say whether it would hold after a flight in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody responded to this question,&quot; said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from rockets and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, was also a cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and have even worked in extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and who gave birth to a healthy offspring after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit,&quot; concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Russia&apos;s hero, Valery Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre of preparation cosmonauts: Mandatory step in preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in neutral buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular exits. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, that is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: Life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Insofar as the baby is about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb, it is easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little to forget,&quot; explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if the child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman is in need of gravity, a force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> OK, do not know it based on birthing simulators. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course, you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then?&quot; Asked Valery Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the earth&apos;s attraction, the body does not form the skeleton and the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of their basic needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience that we would in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté,&quot; provides for the Director of the bioethics committee of the Institute of medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in outer space is still the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time it will become a reality, when the Enterprise shuttle will travel to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) said: &quot;The control of the pseudo self-employment (in Czech&quot; Švarc system &quot;) failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking here,&quot; said Kala in his commentary on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Control conducted jointly by German and Czech inspectors also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot;system&quot; by Petr Nečas Švarc. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls; is it permitted or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect to demand respect for the law,&quot; said Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which were compared the legislation on public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it really matter? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the procurement and specific national laws and an actual practice to follow. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have gathered all of this, and although this process is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: Generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps more severe &quot;and better quality,&quot; however, according to certain parameters, such as the practice is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can this project help you in practice and that is there for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should help us strive to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it was not really a positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means getting the thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of markets, it does not necessarily achieve that goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It could be that the system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find a lot more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different organizational structure? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In terms of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof organized similarly, it also has a board set up a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also has over the accounts of this type in the various Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Bank can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Our public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, there are controlled at the level of the Länder accounts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to national legislation, is it easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it surely cannot say that it is better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don&apos;t have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is also true that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have no incentive to cooperate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> The amendment entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our operations. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we ex-post controls, there is a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our comments relate only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument to detect risks of mismanagement &quot;with which we have scrutinized nearly 14,000 public procurement - where these changes will be felt, of course, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of some types of tendering procedures and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> So what do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an extra load for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the future will confirm this. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can occur is that these rules become more severe, and that it is not possible to meet them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (for example, the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not that way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> So what is the solution to get by? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look at where we are not going. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The Švarc system is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and demand respect for the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It may declare: &quot;We will change the law and authorize it,&quot; but he could not say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking here. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are frozen in places, but most are still passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network, however, remains largely passable, in some places with increased vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary region </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were passable this morning, but also in some places frozen and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Temperatures dropped and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C, but they should just go back in the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The snowfall ceased in the region, and it remains in the plains that a thin layer of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The ridges of the Ore Mountains (Krušné hory), however, are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> According to the data of the regional road maintenance service because of the fog, visibility was reduced in some places. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The fast track R6 and national roads in the region are now passable without difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> However, vigilance is still needed, for example on some bridges with the coating can be frozen and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All county roads and pathways of third category, including mountain roads are passable. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> There is still some of their sections of the remains of frozen snow-packed in places and traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in upland areas, drivers must increase their vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The Directorate of roads and highways said on its Web site that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and compacted snow layers by traffic can be found on roads in mountainous areas and in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké M ‎ ‎ ýto, mainly on county roads and third category. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> Snow lies mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Monts de l&apos;Aigle (Orlické hory). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow-packed traffic is present on the roads in upland areas. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Eastern Bohemia, the time will be dry today, most often identified with possible cloudy periods. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> It will blow a low wind and temperatures typically range between -3 ° and + 1 ° C. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Of Pilsen region </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Roads in the region of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise increased vigilance and adjust to weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It freezes this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and -9 ° C. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After the last snowfall and the ensuing cooling, some channels of communication can be frozen in places. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, the visibility improves gradually, however. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> This is what it appears from the information of the regional road maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The motorway is passable almost without difficulties, the maintenance of road communications, however, recommends increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and Tachov district. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> County roads and third category are moist and applies in this case the warning against the frozen sections. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Drivers must be vigilant, and particularly on less-travelled roads in the region of the Šumava. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Of Olomouc region </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Drivers travelling in areas of the Olomouc region located in altitude must now reckon with a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> This layer remained on the collar said &quot;Červenohorské sedlo&quot; and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The snowfall forced the night road maintenance staff to visit the field; according to the services in charge of roads, it has fallen more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> &quot;On the heights of the district of Šumperk remnants of snow. </seg>

<seg id="1098"> As of this morning, the road maintenance services in Northern Bohemia reported several difficult sections. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Temperatures will remain below zero in lower elevations and snow and ice should remain on the roads and in the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem, and the roads are usually dry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> No difficulty of movement was reported at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> The road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for training: Rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> There are also reports, from the main roads, difficult conditions on National Route 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have bent under the weight of snow to reach the road. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest said: &quot;In concert, we want to collect the positive energy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month, this should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of trap in which we love fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, rather, laughs and says that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive energy balance in order to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, you go up in December a unique project: Three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you provide more details of this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity that we are preparing for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 10 to 11 hours of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will conclude practically at a time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, in a time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to together with the public, reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is called &quot;End of the world&quot; (in Czech &quot;Konec světa zrušeno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, it also will hear at these charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed, and that the end of the world has no place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Also joining the hymns at a given moment in a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The song&apos;s lyrics were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sang... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How do you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We are working with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We strive to engage intensively in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it&apos;s fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will be done with the benefits of these concerts at the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to persons with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and it for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly visit with students of the institute Jedličkův and propose activities that interest them and fun. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we are trying to assist them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička, we will transfer this project in a new building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and performers will at each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria, have you chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will Chinaski, Support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Prepare also to other &quot;mega-events&quot; of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here, too, we will prepare a quality program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I&apos;d like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Haitian Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and logistics of your touring? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not so terrible that it looks at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in an electric wheelchair which must travel in bunker gear, of course we trimbalons also lots of luggage and boxes of instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything has more or less always well past, CSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, I was surprised more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards persons with disabilities, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiences to date? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is not all that is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only in electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet see as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there is also an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Why do we still catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things for which we are still lagging behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements still depend on the efforts of the people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, at the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> This is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are quite the opposite to the cutting edge! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what prompted you to create this group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič said, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> This is true, the fact of creating links with singers and work actively for the promotion of the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The show business is full of tips that mimic each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a way, it is logical: Everything new is accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Few of the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a full life and flourish, as long as they have the necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be firm in many areas and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that it is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> One, Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come and go, you can do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want to or would want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in the Incheba arena in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in Fléda Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay will be sung together when the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to raise money ($25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the institute Jedlička. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994, and over the ensuing years has participated in a number of projects for the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the Second World War, Poles who worked on space flights; they do not always meet understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> For example, I would like to mention the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering book entitled &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only the doctor Jan Gadomski became interested in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, Šternfeld in France won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics of world renown, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> As early as 1925 was built in Poland railway intended to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, there is neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or slow the speeder. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known about this speeder are those of the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was conducted by the institute Komórka en Automobielbedrijf tromp Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the documents that this research had reached the stage of testing. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, plans a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press, and the following year was published the book &quot;Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects were directed military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all plans for the use of the technique of rockets were carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee (&quot;provisional TYMCZASOWY Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), who coordinated all work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November issue of the journal Problem, 1954, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company devoted to astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched, and it was clear that the field of space research in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He retained his position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket with a range of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built an improved version, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a length of 1.4m and weighed probably 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Following the prototype should be able to make concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind aloft. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development work was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was $0.34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0.62 litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has raised public opinion in a heated discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the free movement (without limits) of private capital, combined with an unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate pressure on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term the following meaning: A producer tries by the importation of goods sold cheaply to resist economic competition by making it more expensive, &quot;&quot; the price of a competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: Either transferring production abroad, or buy cheap or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high in comparison to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment that it generates, the social costs of the State necessarily increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the perfect gentlemen entrepreneurs&apos;s unwillingness to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in different economies create a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This occurs mainly in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to compel economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This occurs by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are for years points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already a million the number of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for employees receive such salaries that the state was forced to pay a premium to reach the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economy measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU are, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to eke out a living with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here we need to ask the question: Where will this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will increase from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media claim to have enough of it, that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, the command economy led to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital is very much in the idea that the state may not intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> We must then ask whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not run today, according to its own selfish interests, and by the same policy, the entire state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby and present in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely tied to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies are oriented towards liberalism now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The State has long been deteriorating and functions were assigned by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of bribes, favors received illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The kickbacks and corruption were spreading without limits and the people went to the election with votes already sold... &quot;...&quot; The honest people do not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State went 8 months without consuls... &quot;&apos;It began really to say that the cure for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he had to choose an energetic man...&quot; It is true that Pompey Appianos had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in the absolutist regime. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, today&apos;s society is based on the preference of the personal benefit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to advance the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of affairs, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies such as a sort of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the social and humanitarian crises that we are now witnessing as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by recent and ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is indeed systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is subject to socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: The laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing ever comes out of violence and never will,&quot; said Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main to the refrain is &quot;let us not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want wars, there would be no,&quot; said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some take advantage of Israel, citing its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its recurrent waves of killing; after all, the current population of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a point of view located &quot;behind the curtain,&quot; which primarily benefit on the lingering tensions already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come out of my own understanding of it, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they were to their actions to the throne to someone who led their acts according to pre-defined objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration causing some powers could not be done in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families with an astronomical wealth from the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader, but I can&apos;t rule out). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they became the first global news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and who had always meant for them to strengthen their power, an increase in their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in most of the world&apos;s central banks and preparing or waging wars against the countries in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America of the status of central bank and began to emit during the civil war his own money (government, I understand) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the EDF to have triggered the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power at the global level has resulted in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third is expected to reduce the world&apos;s population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order in chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those that they produced in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg throne, they destroyed Czarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without military and economic reasons (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: They have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany&apos;s enormous war reparations generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they can then place a strong enough leader, pointing fingers, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she was actually) of fifth column to light the touchpaper and trigger a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had originally held; or if everything he did was planned, the fact remains that the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire that could cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the second world war, the first casualty of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East generally. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level, it is enough to see how people bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one mistake begets another mistake in an endless circle of violence and where there is at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here it is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers do not propose to people that their own candidates in elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascisant politician, loyal to the international bankers, who is trying to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) spread to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the entire global oil (a naval corridor width is only 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn baby is born with implant an electronic chip making him a fully controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;They are forcing all individuals, big and small, rich and poor, free and to focus on the hand or forehead a mark, so that he can neither buy nor sell that which does not bear the name of this wild beast, or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> We need to understand: Anyone who has common sense in the figures of this ferocious beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: When things are going badly wrong, call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They should be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in effect, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to obtain the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempt to rescue hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate in the United States sparked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated twists, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through incredible coverage: They left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew came to locations for the shooting of a film in the sci-fi extravaganza. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the story more credible, specialized magazines were state of this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film is an unusual combination of Affleck of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller realistically conceived but also a &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&apos;s eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Successive moods: Documentary-style footage of Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the era of events and how, through these photos, these same situations have been recorded in the film, there is no big differences) </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and acting ceased to be ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film Affleck, who does not take place in his home city of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The meaning of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put his first films over Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also proof of the sense of the atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran &quot;is required&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, has written a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false film crew in the Tehran bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much in too many places shares </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director has had to settle for a subject where there is in fact little exciting scenes, the film sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is doing very well, it adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continued on the runway are quite far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many things to too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved greater attention and it is not, far from it, only in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he lets see with a moderate interest in appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It leads the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a story, in a way, yet to date, and as the exaggerated illustration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into bank charges the most absurd, has now decided to launch the competition rules or ideas from the EU &quot;the most absurd&quot; workshop. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies has been at the root of our decision,&quot; said to the newspaper právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, however, women were an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report until the end of the year another incredible idea of &quot;the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,&quot; informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the EU&apos;s controversial regulations is found, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, which has harmful effects on the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size of cages for hens, which resulted in the increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics have also been made in the past against the ban on the use of the term &quot;spreadable butter&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic currently imposes applications of its banks by threatening to use its veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that in the European Union, bananas should not be larger than 14 cm or submit an &quot;abnormal curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has defended by arguing that it was only non-homogeneous harmonize national standards, complicating the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some states, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulation last year that must appear on the inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has made reference to an American investigation according to which the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 with regard to blow into trumpets of fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Here, too, it was bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule concerning the EU officials themselves is quite absurd: Because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot;Let It&quot; with liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU&apos;s rules on the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic was second, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked, therefore, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this investigation found merit in the idea of paying money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of a grant to request the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas are not coming from Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact of not having a sea handicaps. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union a refund. &quot;Thus spoke, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and the so-called &quot;hard&quot; purchases, the State was found with full stocks that he had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is located far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Grants for grants to municipalities have been proposed by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should, in effect, be used to write applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU said: &quot;The bizarre regulations are rare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the European Union, in Brussels to fight for the right to use specific names for these traditional products, which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky,&quot; for which the name &quot;Tuzemský rum,&quot; which dates back at home in the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzemák.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the alcohol-based products of sugar cane, and not based on sugar beet, may bear the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products in the EU, there are today in the company of world famous cheeses such as feta cheese or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarské suchary&quot;), and carp in Třeboň Pohořelice Pohořelický Třeboňský kapr (&quot;was&quot;) and hops in Žatec (&quot;Žatecký chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread Pardubice (Pardubický perník &quot;) and cakes called&quot; Cornets of Hořice &quot;(&quot; hořické trubičky &quot;) can also be proud of their community trade mark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to save the Republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur, said Senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how did the idea to stand in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president who counts for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything worked without problems in our country, I would be a candidate anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer bear to see as the country was looted over the last twenty years, that the thieves are not behind bars and taxes and the retirement age increase. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that does not please me, so I&apos;m trying to find a solution for change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than forty years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation for me to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered the Senate but you have quickly en route to the Castle (verso: Seat of the presidency). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it that you don&apos;t turn our backs on those who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I am in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would revert to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a function, it is only a tool allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need the influence the largest and broadest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It was, for example, said in my speech that I bribes journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Come to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have begun the fight for the castle with a hobbyhorse themes of physical and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns in excess of 20 million [CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To this end, you have to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole may propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of a tourist guide is a liberal profession, I have been successful. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the politicking: When someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it retards the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent, a member of any party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and partisan dogma, make each party what is best for our country and implement it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You think of yourself as a man of the right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that this is a bit to the left or right, it is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, it&apos;s not that people are left or right, but to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I still support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS, and I act as impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you we will go when someone says to you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you said does not prove it? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan for a company, you also have a certain goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to bring you. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all proposals of which I spoke were applied by the world-renowned experts have spoken. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You do not have a certain amount of time in politics with this. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think if you&apos;re going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my camp to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president by popular vote, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, without hesitation, be a fan, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just throw myself in politics and I&apos;m trying to get the support of the majority of my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I am trying, alone, to get things moving, and if it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;ll quit in six years, and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is a bit as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person can&apos;t make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud in oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I introduced myself because people are really upset, but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and what did it have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to base your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I don&apos;t have the time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don&apos;t have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I did that twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about tax returns, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think about 60 million the value of my personal property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I was in Prague land worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of works of art worth about $10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a kid&apos;s dream: I&apos;ve always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was mannered with women and fought against evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive Aston Martin, you have an estate worth $60 million, and you don&apos;t have money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic, but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested $2 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate a great interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I have no obligation to pay for this campaign in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My campaign costs are covered by the compensation that I will receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I couldn&apos;t live, for example, pay the English school of my son who is 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only goal was to make money, I will present in any elections. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will therefore continue your business activities in order to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you said that you would put your activities under wraps? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not linked to the amount of the remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> It is, however, although I live for something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in Saturday&apos;s edition of the newspaper práva. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not just a matter of imagination, and for proof, just look at Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a shopper on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large company next door, we said: &quot;Yes, it is actually quite beautiful, this building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody will voluntarily in one of these elderly libraries, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a bedroom community that is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore a few neurons in the brain drain, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the shadow seven bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small reinforced concrete painted miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Thus, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to retake control of the statistics: The construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas of the Rotterdam firm MVRDV, master charts &quot;bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still watching, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice by order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech by a substantiated arguments activists: &quot;Dear!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> So, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office, a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Moreover, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, this small town dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades suggest they support a dairy, was enriched by a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural edifice in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado book under bell to cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Certainly, a lift takes you through the heart of the massif, but the real joy of reading and architecture are open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floors and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> There is already in the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the stacks are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; explained Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration of open spaces and reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: In the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the building&apos;s technical center. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, balustrades, stair railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for sight, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened do not want unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, leader of the project to the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Thus, one day we found in a Frisian farm ad hoc waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, has been used for years in the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and it saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, thick plates of four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of heat and pressure, &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, the smell evokes both a new car and sports footwear. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the 105 steps is the summit of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of nearly 500 metres, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They create an atmosphere, but they contribute significantly to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> New donations for the soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is unbelievable, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is heated by geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun shines that little time inside, even in good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams mounted wrong compared to the glass facade use sun visors, intercepting a large part of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Completely automated blinds can do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risky to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, describes itself as &quot;the soul Boekenberg finally found&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully-stocked (today, there are 70,000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are overflowing from all sides. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and the new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV has reached the discipline mistress called in the professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Although it may seem young and poorly educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she then chose the abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of a common and coherent policy within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans face on several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the path to a more normal &quot;foreign policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In practice, that means when the term &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to the national records. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: That is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have affected Germany&apos;s position vis-à-vis the Middle East conflict and abstain from the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany was first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> This is why Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is undoubtedly a key element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I do not give too much importance, because it is not exclusively one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But this is certainly a key element in the German strategic thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany affect its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention during important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think that the gap is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Even that Germany will be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States announced their veto in a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> The opinions differ between the United States and most European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the US domestic political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is secretly extremely understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany is struggling to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it is not helpful for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be included within a broader political line and must assert their unique position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is what they are currently in the issue of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will assume a role in the future of locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question has always been difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany will play a role player on the international stage, Germany does it only play a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or was it always difficult to assume leadership roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not make things any easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: We don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must deal with neighbours and a wide range of opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the United States&apos; influence on European policy is only decrease, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this void, then who is left? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if it does not like them, even if it is unpleasant, and if they are just less appreciated is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America collectively analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name is a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The mark enjoys protection as the company that bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, it is not sure that it would succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialising in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new record arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators require only a few extra letters to be able to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also legally copy, like Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which the recordings made with the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually that counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pattloch cases, however, are different: Its constituents the responsibility to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally conferred to Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak of &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; parent brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are designated women who marry men who are rich. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, we need to combat this trend,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The mark is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs totalling millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third global market for luxury goods, and one that is growing most rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to cancel registrations doubtful of the Trademark Register and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reported cases in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have undermined its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also include graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, the same company that had to buy the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, Volvo&apos;s logger, used before a blue and white logo that resembled that of BMW, the conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarize from Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of anything. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admitted, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the Office would be spent last year of an &quot;emergency situation in the course of the work to a new-found normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing an increase of 75% over the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the Office, it is a record, and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This should also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each recording reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle would cost much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Of course, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator was able to maintain its rights in the trademark Chinese Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the objection of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has been successful with the following two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The vigilance is </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praising the professionalism of judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, he added: &quot;The process is long, hard and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. Archives has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party &quot;a large sum in euros to six figures&quot; to settle the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;That is what we see what it means for us,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if imitators of this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a production company of footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned the sector, but it could still prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;Vigilance is called for.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should also register &quot;in China, everything that is likely to be protected,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg was losing the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or, we would lose our place on the market segment in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Day to Combat AIDS: Stomp, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans of Swaziland welcomed their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> This is the story of a relationship that is much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, foot-stomping: The cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and moccasins for men seeking the pace by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, the voices of the singers are growing slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they will prevail, mesmerizing and follow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with its wild gestures of flexibility. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;OM Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each chorister has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland has 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association &quot;Voices for Africa.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them are attending secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per less, it can become a sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi Zulu means &quot;storyteller&quot; or even &quot;singer of praise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in the foreign language that she has now brought to Germany to visit his native region: Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because at 8,733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is eSitjeni the village, which depends on the power of the German choir voice. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of people with </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV won their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In eSitjeni can be observed on a smaller scale the ills that beset Swaziland: The HIV infection rate is the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population is almost never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have seen many street children who lack parental care not only, but also simply everything: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the beginning, there were only a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely a year later, the choir founded &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; an association which has since then almost professional AIDS orphans in eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial STIs include syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydiées (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Common STIs are HIV, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic to STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men are the source of at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Heterosexual adults, chlamydiées-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections occur among this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, there is a rate of infections related to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the change in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: The figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is declining. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genital organs, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the emergence of pimples and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts therefore recommend to anyone frequently changing sexual partners to pass regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most STIs can be cured quickly detected and late sequelae can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but mostly to funds that are reaping the choristers through their voices across Germany as a whole, the means accumulate. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros in eSitjeni,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The victims, it is so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go every day to school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has no person is allowed in a safe place, Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid for by the association, just as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two barns, with the support of the American organization for health PSI, the association has organized an HIV test for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This cannot be taken for granted, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it is still a taboo subject. </seg>

<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is a real taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is a subject that affects sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is rather odd, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in the place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Yet condoms are found on every street corner, &quot;said Annette Lennartz,&quot; but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to foster some cultural exchange, choristers of Imbongi leave together on a trip every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent are still in the days of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with white people who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humor and joy, but also sometimes hard a tear a formidable border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes them always eSitjeni where the choristers visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, eSitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to eSitjeni, you will find the light,&quot; say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a trip to 8,733 km as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, before these singers who tap into the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice layer could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this is the closest planet to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably came from comets or asteroids that have hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody made any connection between the discovery of water and the assumption of the presence of life on the planet, &quot;said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how water and other essentials to life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, they send images to the land, such small spaces through which we see infinity. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet,&quot; according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of the countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are in blue and pink points, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;babies&quot; in the delivery room of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, named &quot;W5,&quot; a romantic little name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The NASA Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a dying star. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the vast Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust to form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades star cluster also known as the &quot;seven sisters,&quot; can be seen with the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope is more colors. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this infrared photo, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, stare directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal picture and the infrared photo shows a dramatic hue. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the greatest mysteries in astronomy focuses on the creation of the rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared 4.5 billion years without a trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and most net that has taken the Hubble Space Telescope is the galaxy of the Tourbillon. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the hue, the photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light years. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Trifide&apos;s name comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, divided into three), as three streaks of dust divide the gleaming heart of the birthplace of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pileup in the constellation du Serpentaire: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you don&apos;t like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname of &quot;wheel of Southern fire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is located 1,400 light years and is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was developed using optical and X-ray images taken by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle consisting of black holes found at 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy &quot;GC 1810.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula is the group of the brightest young stars in our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The heavenly cradle always gives rise to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are linked by the Rosetta Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there are only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after no Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our view of the universe: The major telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galilee onto a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see further into the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Great Canary Telescope at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter still reaches about 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its uniqueness lies in its great light-gathering capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in the world&apos;s mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists listen to the universe in the search for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or&quot; search for extra-terrestrial intelligence &quot;) by utilizing the computing power of his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> On the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here lies the Very Large Telescope (&quot;Very Large Telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can inform the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 pieces of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not take pictures before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the observatory on Mauna Kea, who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope and FTIR. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration to admire it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the most important space we come from the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, he gives us images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first infrared space telescope&apos;s mirror has a diameter of 6,5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be to find the light reflected by the first stars and galaxies after no Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data exists on this theory, because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole of Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar data indicated for decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip in the Talysh Mountains is a disheveled romanticism. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> In the middle of the many turning points in the road, the small bus principles prevailed: • along wooded hills, torrential rivers and small farms. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, it is almost in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group by the name of Talysh, about which we know little, except that they are fluent Farsi and Azeri and they have a very long life. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town with its overly aggressive plastronne architecture of the Soviet era who do not agree with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year, there will be a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> You can discover the lives of about eight tens of Talysh region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Still have a child to 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when you think that the oldest documented person was 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he would have been 23 children at the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Şirali Müslümov would have it wrong for a few decades by calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Surprisingly older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also in Sardinia, there are men who are incredibly old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Each day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tour guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> By contrast, Fatulayeva, the museum&apos;s director, believes that it is a question of diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calorie-rich meals Talysh, who like meat, bread and dairy products, and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the young people? At Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the ground beside a churn, it beats the content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, who have long been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children enjoy also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for guests served in glasses shaped typical armadus belly. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding in a dark blond dreadlocks that his son tells us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, and that is how I have never lost, and they have kept their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten what comes from his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she tells us of her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev took over the controls. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, does almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, older people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good standard of living in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And maybe the son of long greying Mirzayeva is right: &quot;The elders are highly respected in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the large family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The &quot;human rights&quot; in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution is reborn in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations show the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not short on words so full of emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to make the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was intended for the entire people, but especially to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition confused and hopelessly disunited fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its business &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world does not really know what wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary will be reversed? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the Islamic-dominated Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a night tour de force of fifteen hours are indeed disturbing to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft stipulates that the case law is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what really means the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and it is always a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists are using the vague wording and legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case, it is that suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters relating to the Islamic Shariah, Al-Azhar University must be consulted and is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislature, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to suppress opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State must also, can be read in the project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote morality and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of art, film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In short, it is simply censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantees equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another article prohibits to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, the article does not define what constitutes an offense or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, in his own words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution&quot; rising </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is reborn and we will win,&quot; says Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is &quot;thrown into the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he has accused supporters of Morsi to stage a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims the referendum, it will go to his palace and the reverse,&quot; exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned,&quot; said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration in Tahrir Square, not as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;The people calling for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Cleans our country!&quot; Asked to Morsi, saying that &quot;the Koran was [their] Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where it all began, would have soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with his supporters, had spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of Islamists will win the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned only once&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have been imposed until February and encompass all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This human rights lawyer for 48 years and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he shared their vision of the world, but because for him, human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> This is the reason why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution,&quot; he says during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of the three powers Morsi has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy, and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president denied all its powers,&quot; said Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Yet, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could afford. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> One protester on the square Thahir warns: &quot;You giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be possible to control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk in Norway: Is it the most fragrant fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of premises for an extremely fragrant fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Disturbing and you get the smell of the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, Oslo at about 3 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> The snow, the scenery is spectacular - and that smell, omnipresent, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period - according to the smell you want it exhales - up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness settles and it&apos;s cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here at Fagernes, devoted to this incredible delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, full-time local fireman, also known as &quot;Rakfisk General,&quot; responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people ingest small pieces of fish and slip a large quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer aquavit the rakfisk,&quot; says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I&apos;m trying a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid the pass under your nose, it&apos;s not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi who would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in waterproof barrels of water in the air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the meaning undermined by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals, whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossing the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is seen as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, of Norway&apos;s past. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is one of the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you €10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to displease him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about the killing, they speak of &quot;the incident on July 22.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the sole reason for our success,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, the blond hair and blue eyes transfixing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a tray of rakfisk manually. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how you say - people conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not like to point out. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries were throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse strings tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,&quot; said Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk,&quot; she said in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I&apos;m standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger consisting of momentum, a real discovery, this is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stayed is one of many places where it serves the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the strongest scent of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly-knot, surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> You would think that in the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What did you give score to the best fish in the mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;This is our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We hear laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man fell out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, looks at the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam safety has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, results that must be the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of some 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; said Mr Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Prior to the US President, Mr Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A sprawling and populous state surrounding the capital, on his land of choice, opinions are divided on this new leader. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Direct a man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The premises attributing the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was made to these roads, formerly puffed-up and full of cracks. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plaques bearing his name are hung outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to establish lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party&apos;s congress and M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change that our country desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> Unwavering after 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects the criticism of opponents who complain that the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> This is a man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Nazaire hidden beneath the highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the military has been called out to combat drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone, it was found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back the tears when she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believe that she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,&quot; said the Señora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis was already underway. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall, next to a cross which contains the word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is exactly what the family was denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossipy, a hero of disorder, a main problem?. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and that we remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be as good as president when he was governor,&quot; said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, say prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse which Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during the detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on Manning&apos;s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning was made under extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being responsible for the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the American military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaint about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the case be classified Manning on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This military intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment by his guards was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had within the prison was generally &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not report any complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison, &quot;said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said they would fix them, but they have not recorded the problems raised. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote&quot; no problem &quot;(after addressing the concerns), but this does not mean that I had not caused any problems,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning was also asked why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a &quot;risk of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they had assigned the restrictive status -- one level below the close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to be cut off this status... to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and will be gone once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact that they have not been kept informed of what he was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage,&quot; said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only thing he had was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He tried to remain in motion, because sleep or lie down during the day was contrary to the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woke to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Counsel for Manning filed a formal complaint for the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also Friday, the judge asked to Manning regarding an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- after they have been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning, during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, he was able to cover themselves with a blanket during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the judge&apos;s questions, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to drop its coverage that could hide its nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered the release. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning allegedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or his flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty of the less serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules governing the conditions of detention for all detainees at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the publication of illegal information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all charges are raised, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; they remind Mexicans difficult times, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette said that the Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two tracks: One for the &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros (&quot; Strangers &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what to go to lead. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I was called the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is an ethnic qualifier, in the same way as the one that my friends in Boston are using when they say &apos;Irish&apos;, or my friends in New York when they call themselves &quot;Italian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then, I became &quot;Mexico-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land that was the birthplace of my grandfather, there is no need for special qualifier or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native, and I can&apos;t lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and I headed toward the queue &quot;Strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto paid a visit to President Obama at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join forces in the United States and Canada, and to create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto is committed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once an official U.S. makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma are the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want that it addresses the subject of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more often than not, this person was a typical profile -- a dark, poorly educated, coming from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not that of the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We attach to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent us as if we were people of lower strain and not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, for a little more complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to move closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico-Americans working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that it is essential to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if we consider income inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to fend for themselves, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them of how family members were treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While the same arguments persist futile to know who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s largest city, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has shattered, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps their struggle will increase even more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them out of this impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser and no winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza had been crushed. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Having killed some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine, currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Members of Hamas are growing and say that the Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia is exercising its dominance, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Al-Assad, and through Jordan, where Hamas&apos;s allies are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard-line supporters of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been in a box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that cuts into the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election of 22 January, the party was beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why spoil the pesky giving them a Palestinian state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they ran the West Bank, don&apos;t they launch rockets, like their compatriots have done in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe the hard-liners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring makes a difference. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere have little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think about the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates the problem as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be pushed by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains as advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: Two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and short term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for people outside of this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now seek to halt the flow of arms into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr Obama also has every interest in what Israel is willing to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is a very narrow vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws on cigarette packets neutral came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This Act came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the strictest regime in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government said that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that they never starts. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco companies through their brand image,&quot; said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associated the crown logo to a princess. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would boost black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;Adverse consequences will result from this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have said that the law had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, the sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites to do. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the tobacco marketing and that you have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place par excellence,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask ourselves whether it is a private citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and who took the trouble to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry is focused on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have reported to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries with similar laws on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make mandatory the warning pictures on packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you put the package,&quot; said Victor El Hage when buying a package that contained a photo of tumor of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason I will stop, this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult storage packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had only to ban them once and for all, and we said OK, this is good, you stop and you put the key in the door,&quot; he said, lifting his arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it may be good to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain to take interesting, or even to nurture creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Should we welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back to. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, &quot;said Peter Toohey, Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of&quot; boredom: A Lively History &quot;(Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The problem goes back very far,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then, there is the definition we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, &quot;said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After numerous publications and submitted the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, there is not the desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, it is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or the world, while depressed people believe that the problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we may think that we&apos;re bored while it is in fact a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> As part of their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high for a TV show that had no report, others have just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level said they were more annoyed than the other two groups - they have found it difficult to concentrate, but did not know why, and have attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or involved, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, &quot;said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you make a boring task, &quot;like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, now we know that when wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggling learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We&apos;re bored all one day or another - the delay of my airplane flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a film particularly boring. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;predisposition to boredom Scale&quot; in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The range includes statements such as, &quot;Of the tasks that I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&apos;t have the time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, &quot;said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, adolescents are quickly blase. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent said they get bored when they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is a period when the boredom reached its highest level,&quot; especially because children and adolescents don&apos;t have much control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I ask my question: Boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, &quot;said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The problem is the way that the brain was found to inform you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, this will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it no longer will miss, but he will not have learned to handle alone or if autorégler, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this autorèglement passes from one situation to another,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child does not just learn to play, he gets more control of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think we should glorify the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think that we should criticize it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel at ease outside the constant excitement generated by the activities and technology is the goal towards which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to be bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy the downtime. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés,&quot; he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, was indicted for something that will soon become legal in his state: The possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After that the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment suitable for consumption - minor offences, each with a $100 fine and a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; said Mr Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on the place of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were discontinued. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have ceased to charge adults aged 21 or older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts in Colorado called for speeding up the existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who possess. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of western currently vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what the future holds,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in the state of Washington are also quite a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulation on marijuana, first concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, acknowledges Mr Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could base,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a gap of a year, during which the permit system does not yet exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: How to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees adequate access to marijuana approved and banned the installation of cannabis outlets within a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to install a cannabis sales registered trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legalization of cannabis, a research group recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers, announcing that the &quot;City attorney&quot; (public prosecutor) would prosecute more people aged 21 or older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop charging people for this type of offence &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado, &quot;district attorney&quot; (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to handle cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on users to seek treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people were indicted for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to prosecute those who have committed an offence which, at the time, was a recognized offence,&quot; said Mr Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions were complicated, even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favour of the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the county prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss all cases of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, provide a legal framework for appropriate government and personal consumption of marijuana is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier&quot; with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use, which is expressed as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws &quot;(National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, however, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to deal with the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington State are becoming a test case for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they are concerned the federal government&apos;s guidelines, which is always the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will sell. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has enabled businesses for sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> While it is true that the police is unlikely to push the doors to capture small packets of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes the licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, &quot;said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many Colorado cities have not waited for the federal authorities are acting. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Well before the vote, some local governments have approved a moratorium on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is only a year&apos;s delay. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the city of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should impose the ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory (Conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheatre which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Yet, two weeks after I installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and began to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. N. Wilson said facetious remark that I was a party after being forced to drink in chipped mugs. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and is the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather outrageous, because of the fact that I had a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: My late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why talk about this today, you might say. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students of center-right suffers the same kind of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the students&apos; room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were &quot;often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want there to be a representative on the Committee of the university for equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary shown on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right&quot;), devoted to the policy among students, which depicted the &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It found in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), &quot;which moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver full and moves with a cane chrome head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say they are treated as scapegoats for the establishment of the increase in tuition fees. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years ago, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing leftist bias in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR against people who are center-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This constitutes an obstacle to freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think this way during my first few weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a crippling shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university had voted the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week, when the new students were acquainted with each other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm toward students Tory, but they were fun. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of the classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I wasn&apos;t prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost foot. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man with pustular face, won easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is it that which refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; He asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears were burning eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you&apos;re not too busy to make friends,&quot; he launched a truculent tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner that evening, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a second-year student of English, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said, gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I did not agree with everything that was said by Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This ploy has failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Tories do they love?&quot; Asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, isn&apos;t it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Labour and disown my views? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher&apos;s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a position as professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Thou shalt not be happy here,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open-minded city dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was in disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he told me pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not do that, not in the city of spires dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends communists had impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in her eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Gives them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is for teasing. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would break my heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional strength has gradually deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also a Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a meeting of tutorials the following week, when another history professor suggested the more seriously in the world, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Lethy44 inwardly shame, I admitted to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the old traitai &quot;crazy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed my bag and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never went back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me to wimp pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no child under 18 should not be a victim of such bullying in school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The tragedy is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a strong reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers the elegance to notoriety&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other celebrity clients of the Italian fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer acknowledged at the opening of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for her fashion house over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this building,&quot; he said with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;his pigments&quot; Garavani, who but which could not have been written without his famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino described his personal memories as the trophies of his social mobility: The modest designer of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the international jet set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong with love the royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least they don&apos;t overwhelm their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as do some pop music stars,&quot; said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all have our homeland in his Gstaad chalet guests,&quot; explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, a close friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine supermodel, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, each guest feel important and valued,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; which began to work with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;It never ends of fashion, because his creations are works of art,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of nobility lineage </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Garavani&apos;s life is not a story of obsessions but shared love. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He likes people well behaved and with the biggest titles and love them, too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour of sixty metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: The visitor takes the place of the dummies and to march on the podium to admire a &quot;public&quot; dream of bearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica vitti in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among the public of mannequins, there are names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket, &quot;Gillette&quot; and a jacket for the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a gift that I had done,&quot; said Naty Abascal, one of the designer&apos;s muses. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer to all other for her femininity, her great love of women, and because our sublime beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Princess and Patricia Della Giovampaola modeuse d&apos;Arenberg cannot also forget the first time that she wore a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and was living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his dresses for evening... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the house of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red evening gown with a tiered skirt, and a strapless draped neckline to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Rodrigue d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess d&apos;Arenberg retains the designer&apos;s evening dresses with the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories she vehicle. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of the </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the designer calls her seamstresses) and to achieve this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half metres behind. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress is a historical fact of haute couture at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of customers of high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the &quot;well being&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani combines more honoured than any husband of his clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;Its refinement, its calm, perfect aesthetics and I have always been evident,&quot; Arenberg acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&apos;Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess who said... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is hell, and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, a 400 minors who earn their living by bringing the sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After having collected large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilograms, it installs them in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through the steep trails. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and measuring their not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extract. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, it their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 meters above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, arguably, its employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to whiten sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we move about 70 kilos, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; says Anto, who generally makes three trips per day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> It takes 3 hours each, and he finished exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it may seem to be a pittance for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; said the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I reduced to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At age 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although it covers the face with a mask and wears special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study French or Spanish,&quot; he says in English promises more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this might be sympathetic and intelligent young tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares a wooden hovel unhealthy with other carriers, rises every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to emerge at night, when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying darkness, Anto descends into the crater by illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porters load baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters who are self-employed and are paid by weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Moreover, they do not affect a sub of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is being done to animals, not humans,&quot; protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old portly porter who works at Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not stop to work &quot;as long as he can,&quot; because he needs money to raise her three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind shifted and trapped miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... plus of course their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only load 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, that three trucks at the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 miles away by a sheep trail invaded by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life,&quot; says Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery perpetuated from one generation to another one of the hardest jobs in the world: What are the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans are laying the blame for the lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore must grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfil our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint tablets, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as &quot;Let&apos;s put a handset in the drawer&quot; to make a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem of fun way through this publicity. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill their national duty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that this was an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like launching pheromone scents or organize evenings of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative, but they have not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We therefore said the following: What could be more creative in solving this problem than to make a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The Government of Singapore does not take it lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends US $1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city-state high-tech and South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, Director of Policy of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says that this is due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and family formation,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and to delay marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy designed to dramatically increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites that is a thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in power in Singapore last year suffered its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box,&quot; which can be built in specific areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a surface area of 46 square metres and their sale enjoyed great success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are selling much faster than the larger homes. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much more quickly than those of larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who previously were put a spanner in the works if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of central, it would appear that they do not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, like education, that is why people until later,&quot; said a young framework. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,&quot; says another young man of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, they are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private is private online offline </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality, </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or &quot;the field of private life that we can protect any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is it that is the private domain for those under 16 years old? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> He understands the dangers to which it is exposed by circulating on the Internet of events that he certainly did not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases, they have associated the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level and &quot;the password and username&quot; when they applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I&apos;m not my most personal secrets in a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are top-secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB, I post pictures fun and games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discussed with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I will not share any of my photos or someone who would be the fool,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy recognizes that it was wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write violent or humiliating comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they say, I just position,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He will not trust someone who would recommend to a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14 years old, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on the latter, he admitted that he did not know 20 people on its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;This does not worry me because we have something in common, for example, music,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, nobody has made advances nor asked him his address or telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they&apos;d put the pressure or required, I simply supprimerais my account,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A relative of a friend of mine was extorted money on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;It has only happened in private profile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> We then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do it if I was angry or upset. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know that it is the cyberstalking,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, professor of English and a degree in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the goal of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to seek information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras said that Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book &quot;Digital Natives and immigrants,&quot; uses these words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they, children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, digital immigrants who must then teach them, while we ourselves are in the process of learning,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He added that the issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a definite criteria about what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We also urge them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality for children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so is no good,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Secondly, Porras lists some examples: There are things that you would not be telling a stranger, why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, they want to publish a photo of you as a friend that you have published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you see pictures of holidays, requests you to other people permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone needs to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be such on social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring, </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By understanding each of the words, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what it is allowed to share or to publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children that we should not talk to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven agents present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that he would be released after the close of the summit, and said that he would be released from one moment to another on the Internet site of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information about the summit was constantly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message &quot;closed session, small audio was broadcast in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The lack of information circulating among journalists were those given by press officers of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been urged by the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, you can verify that the document was published last March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international events, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited maximum obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague settled a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear arguments from both sides in the lawsuit that was filed against Santiago and Lima, which begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and implement the verdict that will solve disputes that we have today before the international court,&quot; said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,&quot; added the President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime boundary with Nicaragua that she saw as seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his ex-President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was asked to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he said that the countries of the Unasur would establish &quot;important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on the residence permit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that shares would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triumphalist but should help increase our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our peoples,&quot; concluded the President Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... in uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the president of Peru during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and on cross-cutting themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were for a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will be reinstated within the Union of South American Nations,&quot; in which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The fact that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic discussed at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I had a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these tracks, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will ask to have a discussion with that country,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will solve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible,&quot; added the President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the takeover of the country&apos;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America to Europe must learn how to integrate a citizenship,&quot; said Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which &quot;South America, in this case, should follow the example of Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, &quot;that Europeans were killing each other during the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but they were now almost a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he has defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any country of South America, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, the president of Ecuador has shown support for the rebuilding of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the goal of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who have bombarded us will never compromise, on the contrary, we, the South American, have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington in the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he does not regret his decision, as he himself has not betrayed its principles, but he instead met its &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that, at the time, &quot;there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, the Swedish justice critic who demanded that he abide on its territory for questioning on an alleged sexual offense, while &quot;the Swedish legislation allows us to do so by videoconference, which could be from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small problem, but nothing serious,&quot; said the president of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being locked in a small area without being able to exercise in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of anyone,&quot; he concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stressed that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched a series of procedures to various European bodies,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he believes that &quot;if Britain gave the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as is quite its legislation, as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or asked via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he said that what he did not tolerate was &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that hinder freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists &quot;neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador,&quot; and, rather than put forward his re-election, &quot;it would strengthen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right course.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency &quot;should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts,&quot; because in reality, &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Moreover, the president of Ecuador considers as &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua&apos;s maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We must resolve them in their entirety to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said that it is &quot;beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment if he is strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he saw this possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that, if he lost the primary to February 2013, he would be withdrawing from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty cannot be solved only through political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed the eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, this would be my last presidential term, and then I will retire from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will do it too. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talk with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of President Chávez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the test result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen on my head,&quot; he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it &quot;less painful,&quot; in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man had hidden his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take one of his illness and started to learn about him and his determination was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest HIV patients of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye because he was &quot;speechless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it refers to that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of the immune system that were patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those do not consume drugs: Up to 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis in 25 years, &quot;as long as he remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; explained the scientist interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To put this in context, it is important to know that Mexican life expectancy today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> While it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why is there still death? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know they are infected, or they learn it in the advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is achieving earlier diagnoses, and for that, we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all persons who request it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the State Council AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who has done his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and suffered from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some believe that they are going to die and don&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I die, it is better that I broke out three times a week,&quot; they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but partly responsible, I pay attention to me and to the other person,&quot; says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with JALISCO ARE GROWING in to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, &quot;said Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places dedicated to this, &quot;it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now it gives us packets of 100, that is fine, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at counters, but they are found in public toilets and distributors in places that youth frequent. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not to encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> This is not to pay the girls and the motel, as the governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This is not how it works sexuality, it is best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is the fourth state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of people living with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are sexually, 6% from blood and 2% by perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, as recorded in each case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgment ratified on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the group&apos;s debt restructuring Vitro granted via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighboring countries and having solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> So it looks like corporate survival procedures authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the Stripes, opposite view of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Mexican companies left defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register under the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main commercial bankruptcy procedure is formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean to denounce the cooperation of international procedure in cases of insolvency of firms with a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniform Commercial International was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgement stated that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, Mexican law recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of Business bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, all ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is, the &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he met since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis that faced off against the United States, passing the costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For now, the Gonzalez Sada family company will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to be taken in its entirety, that is to say, with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of non-prosperity and will require the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro in the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, pointing out that the release of the agreements signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, he said that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile up of two parts: Norman Vitro and they overwhelm the country. </seg>

<seg id="2850"> The forum, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just presented a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes &quot;Basketball is my whole life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotter of basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, through him, has traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as great as that of Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage is condemned to wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with Vaqueros de Bayamón or as President of the basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time, as when I was chairman of the NSO, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s,&quot; recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes did not exaggerate when he made this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that recall its non-standard route. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the </seg>
<seg id="2876"> All of his memories, those he loves the most are those who reminded him of his time as a player within the vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;This has been my best years, I&apos;ve benefited the most because I had the chance to participate in eight vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> That&apos;s a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then removed during the championship in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy entered the team of the NSO. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a big player for you, measuring two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> I was then recommended Bartow respect Raymond, who has been naturalized and who was a better shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship, respect would help us try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He was pleased vaqueros championship with respect, but only at a distance, as in 1988 he was the czar of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you have? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we have put a beating on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, respect, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in lieu of players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Person in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> That was the best leader of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In young people, I love the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> It is one of the most glorious era for the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> You remains to be done? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of the minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, boys in Ponce play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during the play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people travel and play too, whereas this is not necessarily required. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least given the benefit of the mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, is known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series &quot;Dallas,&quot; in which he played an unscrupulous businessman, ruthless and manipulative. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon JR Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production company of &quot;Dallas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role again ironic that he loved the most,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the aftermath, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and he will greatly miss. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional person and he lived life fully,&quot; Gray said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The doctors had diagnosed with liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and admitted he had drunk a lot for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumor in the liver and he had undergone a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman had made known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was changed when he discovered a genius, played by Barbara Eden, and they return home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He has also played in two comedies, which remained little time on the air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his film credits include roles well-received by critics in &quot;The Group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to a stunning portrayal of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed its greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The CBS drama series of the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who shot J.R.?,&quot; invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in bets played. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers on average in front of their screen and have made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which was attended by 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. had made pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to attack him. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smile: A dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to place his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what it should be the epitaph for J.R,&quot; Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should write: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here is the only party that he has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste from the original series, recalled Hagman this Friday as a man of &quot;immense, both on the small screen as in life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know him and love him. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; aired a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> Registration is already completed five episodes for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So far, neither Warner nor the channel TNT did on how the death of Hagman will be integrated in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who came to fame with such classics as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on the scenes of the theaters of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and that he married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he called his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin &apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&apos;: The ruthless memories of J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I have nothing written in this book that might hurt someone or affect in any way whatsoever,&quot; he told the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients worried. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advise, I restored their confidence, I come with them when they come to undergo surgery and after,&quot; he says in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to give them a bit of comfort, such as &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid, this will not be easy for a little while, but it&apos;s going to be OK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been an activist against tobacco and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course dealing with the &quot;End of the World&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, shouldn&apos;t, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart charmed decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;countdown&quot; of the Maya calendar, December 21, referred to by many people as evidence of the imminent end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor charmed had no idea what awaited them in the following months: The catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the &quot;Armageddon&quot; debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian thinkers of the end of time thought that would trigger the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that I have never experienced,&quot; said this week he charmed his students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and told us, this was a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only professor to teach courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple, the assistant professor Barry vacker teaches the course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, shouldn&apos;t, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, and how they offer some hypothetical scenarios guide human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; said vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add&quot; 2012 &quot;to be able to give the course again, if the world does not would disappear,&quot; said Professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the looming disaster, &quot;students should explore, create projects and spend their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students no choice but to work &quot;until the night of the supposed end of the world,&quot; said Berg. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Courses have proved to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was complete in two hours,&quot; said Restall about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on the part of people who were asking if there was still room. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people are capable of doing to feel better,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and nurse for 25 years, claims to have viewed all apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this material,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students interviewed, much less a professor, told us to believe in the end date of the world of 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,&quot; said Julie zegle, last-year student at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, &quot;said Berg. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I admit that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has led to a boom of such speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other parts of the world, people don&apos;t think about it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The majority of the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that it was going on here, &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines are not at the end of the world,&quot; we there replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a grace of the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Berg noted that over the years, there has been talk of many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, &quot;people will begin immediately to think about the next date&quot; or to philosophise about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The students and teachers take the date lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several have told us that they thought they were going to parties &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Sometimes, I call friends and rigolons us together,&quot; said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student. </seg>
