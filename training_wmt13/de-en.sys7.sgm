<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, by reiterating that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, in fact, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast with Canada, the US states for the conduct of the elections in the Member States responsible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or ballot boxes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon after the elections in November 2010 has gained in importance, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced only in 2011, which restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that the voters a card and a proof of the US civil schaft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws also shorten the period of the early voting, the law declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens denied the electoral law, for which a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate required to produce a card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state of such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the course of the last two years, they drove in 34 states, with which the voters are forced to produce a card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible people not by a governmental authority of their state card. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to obtain the necessary ID card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Among the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of an African American, 15% of people with an income of less than 35 000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, their card issued by the body to use. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which elect more on the Republican side, the tickets issued by these clubs to use for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, not a federal state for the electorate called for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first federal state, which instituted a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizen schaft. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 laws promoted in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day has been abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Since 2009 adopted measures, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states pass laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, an African American, even though they only account for 13% of voters in the federal state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same is true of the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, whites, which represented 76% of voters, only 46% of voters, who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of the electorate. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial legislation. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to partially limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states pass laws that require the colleagues of a card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The Democratic critics point the finger at the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that those states which have passed these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college are needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system has a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: the test should be done or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA-Test, in fact, sometimes faulty results in false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to greater reluctance of the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Should the test be done or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have obtained the opinion of two doctors. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States there were a number of disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that observation after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> This is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives who had been ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been identified. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are some types of cancer, aggressive and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> According to the patient, the extent of the risk of cancer is really being made clear by the possible options in which prostate crab can remain untouched, if it does not affect the life long term, and in these cases rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, for many men, in which cancer has identified no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active monitoring and offers them in advance of the disease to a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> This is why I recommend, however, that the implementation of the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor, in order to determine whether he should be executed or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Society for Urologie Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible that the pros and cons of the PSA-Tests. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded from the following address:: / / movember / / Mens Health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention of disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> In spite of the advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would get enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no smokers, this figure would rise at least to 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, we have buildings spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that around 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> As for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for many other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It greatly harms the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; lamented the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduced the risk of cancer death by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society promote obesity and obesity as well as the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem the risk for breast, grimm appendix, appendix, table Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the entire life protects against grimm colorectal cancer,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, it increases the risk of a Grimm or colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be shunned. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by Räuchern, dry or Salzen can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage the body&apos;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have the link between vitamin supplements and cancer study. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their studies are currently not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study reducing the risk of prostate cancer has been found, showed a different rather than an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer also has not yet been made quite clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, said Mr. Beaulieu, we have buildings just how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family long-term. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs-Boson analysis </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain sensation, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> In fact, that this Boson believes in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Finally, it is the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best, or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not entirely sure that it is really about the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model is strong. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Nevertheless, let us suppose that it really is the Higgs, there seems to be only a small risk to deceive themselves, and we are looking at what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is a necessarily inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects are not at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to violate this rule - and you do not try to strong, because you will be hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> After all, even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; and the &quot;status quo&quot; by and large, consists of some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and the pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other Bosonen, a sinister gang of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This Bosonen structure, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here, and the &quot;particles&quot; through which the great forces of nature and it would be somehow related to the Higgs-Boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you have the ability to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the &quot;light particle,&quot; the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If a particle with an electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field is in this place &quot;disrupted&quot; like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen &quot;winner of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> Stable business field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true of the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs-Feld, must be &quot;disrupted&quot; so that this Boson shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs-Feld is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must achieve very high energy, a little comparable with a frozen pond, the surface of a very large rock could be zerfurcht. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why it is a huge particle flurry as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 kilometers! - in order to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some people, such as the magnets used to do this, but others are not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And it also does not interact all particles with the Higgs-Feld: those who do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> What all this research can now &quot;be good,&quot; asks Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> As for the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM precisely to investigate. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are, in fact, many physicists who sincerely hope that these differences will be found, because the slightest difference a door open to a &quot;new physics&quot; and could fill some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter still have major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (once again ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, such deviations from the CERN has so far not been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell labs are not believed that their work would trigger a similar revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the lasers were invented in the 1960s, and in 1962 the first permanent bar lasers (were the first gepulst) has developed - has already said that the lasers at the beginning rather than a &quot;laboratory&quot; has been considered. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications may also arise from all the instruments which surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the pulp with a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as the &quot;eye&quot; and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die.... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;dying in dignity,&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must shortly be resumed, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, it remains in this important area a lot more to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to look into this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, which saw him aufzehrte, he had left a period of two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have seven years,&quot; he said in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, in which he had reached the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock, it is not prepared to be,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him, just to go to the toilet and even to eat themselves. </seg>
<seg id="156"> On the table before a delicious lunch, do he resigned a dinner to help. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Bravely, it even manages to smile and to talk with the strangers around him, his medication, and he offers a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that my diarrhea cure, because this is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this scourge. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learned that a man in pinkelt,&quot; said Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In the period of childhood is to return home for some people an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept a step backwards, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, great events take place amid these setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who are being trained Victor-Gadbois in the home for palliative care, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage they are doctors and nurses who care about them, no longer with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care inundated. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years old, is the worst fear, &quot;deliberately and suffocation&quot; to die. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But by the disease, I have my children really knew. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no aspirations in life,&quot; she says, before she accepts that she is a mask, which will help it to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It is expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit of her son, who comes from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the Victor-Gadbois home, with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in food intake. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care will then be used if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to make the deaths more pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, state residents a bed for palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, given that we all will die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This is where life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It granted the dying depending on a word with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics have no longer control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, we have Mr. X served up a beer, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son is the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are helping families and patients alike,&quot; said nursing director Nathalie Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The Victor-Gadbois home is not a day like the other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> As well as an old man of 93 years ago, the last family meeting in the farm and well supported by his bed, while his opening, a young man dies from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years shows,&quot; says Dr Christiane Martel worries. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois homes come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and society for domestic palliative care in Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this major shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several specialist doctors in palliative care for the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard lapo man has been signed, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care before agreeing to switch to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with no action has been taken to their relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the people want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite stubborn worst predictions until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The survival of Hélène Richard was already minimal, when she broke off a difficult chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin that I will cut off the treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I have given up the fight, they said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that I was in the end! </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it must be made clear that palliative care in terms of pain treatment is not omnipotent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal 8% of patients are not in a pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, the doctors are thus often terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or lasting until einzuschläfern at the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer act as if we do not take one side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminale Sedierung. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain cannot be alleviated, say all the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean, &quot;I want you to euthanise me,&quot; but &quot;I would like to see my pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian health institutes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Housing scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the Straßenbauamt, the bauhaupt industry companies, money providers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell us every day, which they have a great &apos;system&apos; in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry,&quot; which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange how the system is falling apart, since drastic measures have been taken,&quot; witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal has been with him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road works in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau-Bericht&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and bribery of government officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the start of the study in 2010,&quot; he said, &quot;would have been only the transport ministry saved a billion dollars in the Treaties,&quot; because some zügelten their instinct to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau-Kommission &quot;has already had two mayors,&quot; he adds, in the hope that it will be able to &quot;identify the tactics behind the individuals.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="222"> In addition, the police officers of the &quot;mart au-truppe,&quot; which since 2009 has meant that the &quot;sewage cartel&quot; of Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties more restrained... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In the last few weeks has made it mass raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard marc otte is the mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, has resigned. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected, in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I have been accused, in fact, engineers from the Straßenbauamt of Montreal, as well as Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has a sensation, giving the Commission the workings of the &quot;system&quot; for the maintenance of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a paid agent in connection with the Mafia, the money to the European Union, Montreal gave the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. Zambito was in the 2000s his hands throughout the game by more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals have been in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also confessed to illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organised. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Drainage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal it worked the &quot;system&quot; of corruption smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former civil engineers Gilles Surprenant has described in detail before the Commission: ten years ago he received from the developers gifts, invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in excess of 736 000 dollars in exchange for drainage contracts, he artificially inflated their costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the Straßenbauamt have admitted that they could be insuring by invoices with false benefits artificially aufblähten at 30-40%. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, the organisers of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay accused that he has deliberately been ignored by a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay in early November resigned, as Montreal plunged into a severe crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As the mayor of the city district Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of municipal land for 5 million dollars and 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market has been sold. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% black money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The study, which will be carried out in the end, she says that they &quot;on a thread, which allows the functioning of the system to emigrate from carried to understand, in order to stop the evil, and expose the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> She says that the process of &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are going to clean up the wound, however, need an investigative unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How can we do clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, notes that &quot;officials stole several hundred million dollars,&quot; but above all concerned about the role of the &quot;agent of the tactic in the picture,&quot; if they were not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> On the basis of a share of 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: &quot;I was told that this was only a weak copy of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to restrict the donations to political parties to 100 dollars, which he said that nothing would change in the situation: &quot;As long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in the policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of political parties: &quot;We cannot fall further; by things with courage on the bottom, the House on a more solid base with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and that damages from Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season, you have with PSG a new scale. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can see it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Wonderful players are here. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am making progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff gave me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors spur me on a daily basis, to improve my game levels. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game that is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything is going very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I must stop enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF claire fontaine to my playing time in St etienne, I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They make up the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The newcomers this summer are accustomed to a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> You also know that every training unit is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player like me, and his best wishes. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my playing position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He will Co-Trainern support such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti gives all people respect a. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is among the best coaches of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has had contact with big players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At that time, I was just recovering from an injury. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 Lyon gave us the place of the front-runner. </seg>
<seg id="280"> We lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the advanced semi-finals in this way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we are going to be against very good European teams that we will have their say. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to start our group in Porto, so that the return leg of the semi-finals advanced as a home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG is a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already had the budget for it.... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name over the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> In financial terms, the PSG the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Would it be a great failure, not the title of the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we are really keen to cream off this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season, we were close off. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We ended the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, it should be with 79 points to be master... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has reached an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even though the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have the stuff to win it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media can expect a lot from PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> Given what has been invested, and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and there is still something you can accuse us, which is certainly a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to set up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> One team builds itself with the time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have strength shown. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons and included fails to qualify for the advanced semi-finals and also a huge expense. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the invested money, it was believed to break with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the French schaft ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were of this new &quot;geboostet&quot; PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in May of the smiling victor and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties, after all. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much better that we talk about a &quot;zlatan addiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> In other words, that Ibrahimovic is powerful and too many doors. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This is why he has arrived, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the players and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respected the people who saw him surrounded. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is really extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their own levels. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, making it possible for all the others to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have the Euro 2012 experience with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It is a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was close to my heart at this European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have things seen from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, it is possible for me to achieve good matches in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This has been since my start with the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you have for the first six months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strict, it is close to the players, and suggests the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> It was also Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not make a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved his goal by making us qualified for the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps, the &quot;Bleus&quot; will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Is the forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1:1) an address? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has worked for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin payments and selling without a bank is possible </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identify transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as so often in these technologies a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies will lead to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Satoshi naka moto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc. convertible) and a protocol on the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15 000 computers in the network have already collected around 200 000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand Web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or a payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later he fell to 2 dollars before he now has recovered to around 10 dollars (prices are on the website bitcoincharts). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currency interest shown for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes Bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the traditional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot; ,&quot; which will be used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network of Facebook has also developed such a system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, the trade is constantly monitored and dealt with by a central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time repositories of the accounting book, auditors, financial issuers, as well as buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How this network works? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Any transaction between two users is in fact between two Email addresses through an Email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose to pay a different address, which ensures the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of information related to this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the widespread accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;are&quot; the new transaction, and they add a figure before the whole thing will be &quot;dismantled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the figure, which is a special fingerprint (many noughts at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user on the Betrügen two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without any link, because they have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which has solved the task, receives 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to prevent an inflation rate that reward will be regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The circulating Bitcoins is thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionstel divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.... </seg>
<seg id="380"> Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already peaks and troughs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen from the Bitcoin-Einlagen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The weakness is not the real record,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay with real money, and Bitcoin is using the network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The European Central Bank also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, it also has cash on these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the Twitter-style Word press will accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, a &quot;Mega-Schlussverkauf&quot; started. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,&quot; Jon Holmquist, who works for the company coin abul, the Bitcoins converted into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His Paytunia system is in line with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, the holder managed its identity and can therefore remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can be easily implemented in the shops, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> You must simply indicate an address from a telephone &quot;photographed and identified,&quot; Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> It is a general trend in which the hierarchical systems for more horizontal required systems are being reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take some time before Bitcoin wins, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB is, in fact, in its report, the various today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success to revalue its currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are withdrawing from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after that? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States should follow suit at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army is taking back the property of their territory, and that the Afghan people will decide their future without anything to expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have particularly punished the Afghan farmers by we have seen them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and mutilated. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but also often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Does, sometimes backed by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries are more subtly. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the outpost in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill planted with almond trees, using the French loans has been financed, has been carried out properly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The überflogenen trucks and armored konvois of helicopters have Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more than the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Since its irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various rebel groups from the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their arrival was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan women have the price of the obscurantism of the al-Qaeda organization overthrew farmers paid for, but their situation has still not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are back to power. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into traders by land seized by the government, as construction of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and benefit from the massive American subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have been discredited, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> As I have heard in the campaign, people want a government that is not composed of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who have been able to make the American contributions to use: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people have the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have made contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, and a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, state schools full of girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> This is a young man, not the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders want to return, there will be jobs available. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, will be seen everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> An army is now there. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will the authorities under which authority it will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already seeking the restoration of the militias in the province, which will take away the power of the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities would benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the case of the Western nations, but by abolishing the post of prime minister, which has been in existence since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, it is his country since the 1950s and has long been dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning power stations are non-existent and important irrigation systems have not been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative will be a priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country which has been devastated by 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructure needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to conquer it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy, in order to process the iron or Kupfererz on the ground, or without transport for the export of the mountains, no mining is possible. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have the copper mine has been almost abandoned by Mes Aynak, the international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site make their digs and remain the main employer in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely one and exports depend, to restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young gymnasien, Institute for French universities, very institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, in support of the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, a service &quot;civilian-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been halted in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages in numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation, in order to try to win hearts and summon &quot; and the impossible task of the compatibility of assistance and proactive actions to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and improvement of agricultural land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What souvenir we leave after military spending of two billion euros? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, often at a level of more than 2 000 metres the valleys are very hard. </seg>
<seg id="449"> In the message, there are dozens of written questions of small agricultural projects undertaken by local authorities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> If the farmers get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, and their desire for their own statements, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and directly affecting civilian aid to their advantage. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution with a sledgehammer in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> We are talking about a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily granted the unlimited power, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided to put everything on a card. </seg>
<seg id="454"> To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on the next day will adopt its final version. </seg>
<seg id="455"> In just a week, the leader of the House had two extra months for the completion of its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Egypt is building now for almost two years on an interim, amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> As far as his opponents remained the president in his &quot;autocratic frenzy&quot; by continuing to &quot;break his word&quot; and &quot;the right underfoot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On behalf of his supporters to be assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the space of 14 days, a referendum should be held. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period, forcing the brothers to dispense with their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> After excess, in an interview with the American weekly Time Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably. </seg>
<seg id="464"> With the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote an ultimatum: &quot;Either is true to her for my draft or I reserve the unlimited powers,&quot; the latter should end after adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> 85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The majority of the Liberal Democrats has not complied with the request. </seg>
<seg id="467"> On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they were turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into account. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to achieve the quorum, yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some people are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the Pendeluhr of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which has not yet been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, is identical to that of the constitution since 1971 and says that &quot;the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that &quot;the principles&quot; by &quot;the rules&quot; to replace a stricter application would have made possible. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect to the other members of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot; of the liberals, who see only as propaganda. </seg>
<seg id="478"> After all, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In particular they have in mind, Article 220 of the Al-Azhar University gives an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the Ägypten spezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because &quot; the people who are being asked for an opinion, are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the first signs of a theocracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the Liberal Democrats are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less likely to be more moderate than the present. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;At the moment there is no specific religious commitment. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most lawyers, who have been working on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, many of whom have been trained in the French system,&quot; soothed Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he admits,&quot; that in relation to Article 220 may be an ambiguity, because the terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It is here in particular to the &quot;Fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence Red.]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Moreover, the question could be raised in future, whether civilian courts are competent to decide.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Apart from its religious aspect, it is the last text strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers he granted to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood argued that they compared with the former regime are significantly reduced. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another sticking point: the powers of the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget was not submitted to Parliament, but a National Defence Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Similarly, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military commissions, as the groups have called for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text of which they see as threatening freedom. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The offence of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> This word was not included in the previous constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> While the Egyptian president last night had to speak out on the television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> The supporters of the head of state will demonstrate Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The big and powerful&quot; leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPs and human rights activists discuss what benefits the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already taking action with counterfeit certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal is to pay for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country to earn money. </seg>
<seg id="591"> On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every working immigrant is a test of knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> So far this arrangement applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing economy and want to work in the retail sector. </seg>
<seg id="593"> But the tests with the federal immigration agency in the future for all migrant workers on duty. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It is not only the language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Languages need both for the preservation and the extension of work permits will be proven. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian language is. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Also excluded from this law are people who have their educational certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> And protection of human rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The entirety of the audit will be under the aegis of the puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of friendship among the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg Staatlichen University and other Russian universities. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The migrants will be able to take the tests in all the cities; already in Russia have already opened more than 160 such centers. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative to introduce the tests was made by the members of the State Duma and supported the federal immigration authority. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Human rights activists, however, came before the entry into force of the law in the press on several occasions the following question: what does it actually mean? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes is the rule, language skills, both for the Russians and for the migrant workers? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, from spokesman for the immigration authority, it seeks to reduce the number of forced labourers. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers,&quot; says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organised recruitment will result in 90% solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> On the problems facing migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Sebelew is convinced that a future without language skills will meet people with bad intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents left and 12 to 14 hours a day work. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We are receiving many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In the home, you are the one promised, and you will be cheated at the arrival, get their passports confiscated and do not receive the promised wages,&quot; confirmed the head of the main management of labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow. </seg>
<seg id="612"> It is not moaning, boss! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they not only do not speak the language of the destination, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much their guilt, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only make a sound basic education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> After all, in their families, there are still not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school matters. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As a teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to earn money. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;It is difficult without language,&quot; she admits. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Human rights activists stress the important aspect of the law. </seg>
<seg id="620"> According to the test, only migrants with legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Do you not do this status, there is no scrutiny and therefore no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the bulk of migrant workers remains illegal in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome&quot; or &quot;access to banned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is bureaucratic and, of course, the linguistic problems. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, the legalisation will cost: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> A fake registration can be found quickly, and only for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The staff of the Russian police are aware that our documents largely falsified and we are not registered, and then arise from cases of blackmail. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,&quot; the Tajiks Umed Huschkadamow against journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;But spare no costs for false papers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> Back in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Some counterfeit certificates, which besch some of the language tests, were employees of the federal immigration agency. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The fake papers have been printed with an ordinary colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to stop the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this will cost a migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree. </seg>
<seg id="637"> For the moment, the authorities can immigrant workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, just promise that time for a language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, newcomers without language posts offered in areas where no active consultation with people is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Interior ministry denies illegal arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> Percentage of legal weapons to crime extremely low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This means that the authorities are reacting to the recent events: people have been wounded in shootings at weddings and seven deaths during the killing spree of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years. </seg>

<seg id="645"> Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities, the problems with &quot;hold the screws&quot; want to fight. </seg>
<seg id="646"> The Internet has been published an open letter, whose author - representatives of various armed groups - are demanding from the authorities of &quot;senseless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Interior Ministry, there were 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total 1 168 thousands of offences were recorded. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals to operate on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> At the moment, you can, according to the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: from the factories to the officers </seg>
<seg id="653"> The weapons arrived on several channels on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="654"> There are five main channels, told a former Col. Viktor Baranez, the ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot website, which takes up arms orders </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were both of the Russian officers and the Kaukasiers itself stolen,&quot; Baranez says. </seg>
<seg id="658"> On the second channel illegal weapons, police defenders are stolen by criminals. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranez explained that this weapons count, both from the armouries of the police force and directly by members of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military camps, there have been frequent explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There is evidence that in some cases of arson was to cover up the lack of weapons,&quot; says the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="663"> A contribution to the black market, according to Baranez, the arms manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Today there are countless private arms factories, which do not stand up to the international competition and therefore the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Another channel of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a Mafia, organized smuggling,&quot; explained the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="670"> In 2011, a report was drawn up by the Centre for analysis and public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the federal service for state statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons came from, according to the investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the &quot;guilt of those responsible in their work to do with weapons,&quot; it says in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the data of the researchers, 17% of weapons from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in the arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavation. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A sales adviser of an arms shop were to do, who does not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal digs, for a long time no one is buying, because they are outdated. </seg>
<seg id="676"> He said that it is more likely that traders in a military camp. </seg>
<seg id="677"> More than a Fähnrich is a weapon, for example a pistol from the TT type bought. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,&quot; he said </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;The police, of course, know all about them, and that is why, if the plan for the detection of crime cannot comply with periodic monitoring purchases by traders by offering illegal weapons,&quot; the advisor adds. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in luxury shops&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> Buyers and sellers find most acquaintances with each other. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I was looking at websites and blogs, as someone who has been paying attention to me, and I suggested to the station &quot;Begowaja,&quot; where a person would wait for me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the weapon I was told </seg>

<seg id="686"> &quot;In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend, contacts,&quot; the adviser said. &quot;I have a friend, but I do not trust him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are traders on the markets, but we must go there and have agreed on a code such as &quot;Ivan Iwanowitsch, which is that the daughter has lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> I am now even in some newspaper syndicates about an acquaintance, whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He gives me the networks simply because he knows that I do not verpfeife him. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The models according to him have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given a photo album, where &quot;everything possible&quot; was contemplated. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like a luxury shop,&quot; remembers the military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer gets Baranez is not a pig in a poke, but can try everything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I buy as a potential customer is not only easy, but it will go with the seller in the forest, and that is where we are a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other,&quot; the expert describes the approach. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shopping on the sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> Internet search engines show search results on Web sites and groups in &quot;Vkontakte,&quot; where weapons &quot;for various purposes&quot; are being offered. </seg>
<seg id="700"> It will not require any documents or there are personal meetings. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;You need just the right amount money,&quot; it says in the advertisement on the website &quot;pistol or rifle purchase.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> That is where users give your orders and ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> It is also being sold to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Of course, without a license,&quot; asks users, &quot;Ivan&quot; (direct quote). </seg>

<seg id="708"> Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The authorities are taking the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer has the money via a bank machine. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;As a response he receives a photograph and a description of the hiding place of the weapon,&quot; told the press officer of the non-profit organisation &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; Dmitry Kislow. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranez stressed that it would also be left empty-handed at the end and may be behind bars, if you have a question placed on a website. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service attacked recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers want to buy the weapons, the service on the Web. </seg>

<seg id="716"> A Makarow for $100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> As for the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say that with prices of 100 to 900 US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislow of the organisation &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; may be a pistol from the Makarow type to buy 100 to 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> You have to wait for up to one and a half months. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The weapon is in military arsenals of country supervisors. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry was the number of offences of illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22,9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7,8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the United States are junk food and supermarkt employees </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American young people is sitting somewhere behind the coffers of Mc Donald </seg>
<seg id="724"> Over the past few days, there have been everywhere in the United States for massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Yet no one can predict whether the protests will increase even further, or whether they will soon return to the air. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests of trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations supported. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers are the organizers of the protests which aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after thank giving the so-called Black Friday, in which Ausverkäufe in the United States took place, the anlockten millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some walmart workers, of whom 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targeted people of low and middle-income countries. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells all products, comes on hunting guns and car batteries up to saugers dust, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The commodity in the walmart branches is averaging between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why buy many of the minor paid walmart only one of their own jobs. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the range of goods on Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Critics say that can often simply the goods Wal-Mart, so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants in the protests on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical walmart worker, who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company&apos;s average wage increase to 12 dollars a hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost. </seg>
<seg id="741"> These are approximately 1,1% more than they now pay. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart wage increases fully pass on to customers, each purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Every year it would be for them in comparison with this additional spending of just 12.39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that only in nine states came to protest and that the company sucking any losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his Lades of 8 o&apos;clock at night on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart approximately 5 000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> All in all, the walmart insurance companies in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that as a whole &quot;less than five&quot; walmart workers laid down their work, and the protest campaign is just &quot;another PR stunt&quot; by the union, which organized the protests. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free pay!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests began this week in New York, where their aim is not, however, walmart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and other low-cost restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the company sell billion chickens, and yet you have no Krankentag, and you will not be paid for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation at 7,25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food opportunities the minimum wage will be gradually increased, but not too much, and on average its ordinary staff in New York 8,90 US dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s has stood behind the Theke, but the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No one was seen as the main source or planned to stay there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with staff members of McDonald&apos;s permanent people who complain that they live on this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author says that it is irresponsible to have children, if we do not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants in the protests on Thursday at 6.00am in the morning before the McDonald&apos;s in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food opportunities will receive a minimum wage of 15 dollars an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits corporate governance to stand in the way of this objective, and abzumahnen, or to lay off union members. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Malcontents </seg>
<seg id="767"> Strident protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food opportunities in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The climax of the protests was an assembly at midday at the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says that it sell billion chickens, and yet you do not Krankentag, and you will not pay for your honest work!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats support, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we should support the fast-food workers together, so that they receive a fair wage and can achieve the economic prosperity that all New Yorkers deserve!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times it was the biggest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from all are employed in the fast-food industry, in the work of tens of thousands in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise the entire masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain can be so far only&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technology popular theme of the enlarged reality in recent times usually perceived through the lens of a special lens. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, Google was presented in the summer at its annual conference a working model, in November it was announced that Microsoft had filed a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, but it is clear that the lens for the scientists of the company was only a staging post. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual free spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please briefly describing what research your group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, humanity largely stuck in the phase in which it is working with Pixeln on flat screens, which are sometimes also affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect-Sensoren are a step forward, and today is no Xbox without Kinect sold, because everyone interested in management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - As far as we are still expected in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect interaction has brought on a physical level, a lot is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decisive. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change the work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We have to lay off the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, it is essential that not only the user, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could make the real world much easier by adding virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First, we should take this crazy virtual reality wearing loose! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about language management? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it will not be overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because they are issues of privacy, because they do not always all others would like to inform them about its actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers are good, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we were working in the area of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and narrow, rather than experimenting with sprawling gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In doing so, the gestures were not from the camera, but by a bracelet he always wore recorded, which observed the movements of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively large, in theory, however, could be reduced to the size of a Armbanduhr. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But on the whole, however, is the future of mixed management types, such as Gestik and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - We would ask me, for example, to reach out to you this Sprudeldose? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally, I will say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Does this mean that you want to see the user adapt to what a machine at any given time can do and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but we are talking here about a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future, above all, work on the development of new sensor types, which allow reactions of people to grasp. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The laser sensors, for example, can be, because they offer a good dissolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What are you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> In the absence of dissolution, depth or anything else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, there would be 8 mega pixel with a speed of 1 000 fps is not a bad thing. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the pixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough, because the designers of the algorithms have more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only along the X and Y, but also along the Z-Achse will be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of images per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of human beings are extremely dynamic and, frankly, are the present 30 fps, especially for gestures to little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed a sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 mm, with the current commercial carriers closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For my work, I was just a device, only without reserve management and with more images per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - If the number of cameras will not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> Kinect is currently working with three &quot;cameras,&quot; with one of them actually an infrared station, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB-Kamera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the depth. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could possibly solve the problem.... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate the problem, given that more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice, a flexible, Kinect-ähnliches system in which we could play with different tendencies, to see how we can help in the three-dimensional identification of a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I remember rightly, Microsoft was in contrast to Google his lens is not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, it is not pleasant, always en route to a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste version would be a &quot;rotating&quot; enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud from the lens of the smart phone tune </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal &apos;gadget&apos; and therein lies its strength (leaving such personal matters, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness, because it prevents an enlarged reality through glasses that you work with others in virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air is not only Tony Stark Iron Man, but also sterblichen. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem to which critics of this idea often: there is no noticeable reaction. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands are feeling nothing at all! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers to your group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often refer to the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe that the eighth breakthrough may well be the integration of the taktil perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently using the second hand as somewhat unusual instruments. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure very well! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies, which are actually aimed at the &quot;pictures in the air&quot; Festival, for example, the collision produced by some rays at a certain point where the finger is a feeling at the moment but it is still so weak, as someone who pustete about appearing. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also Bänder on the wrist to the Nervenendungen in the fingers, which is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Did you try to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> I think that we can see what it should feel when it is just a little? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, so we have not yet tried it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> This is another task with which we still have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually endless space; here, we are working on concepts with bands (other than spreading through gyms), mobile platforms, as well as large pellets. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, we can only outsmart the brain, and we still have many busy years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher: in many areas, we are only just beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Eigener taste rather than culture - rosbalt; ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt, the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde,&quot; the city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the arts and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the elite list have already landed senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and often acceptance in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer, at szene or at Vernissages. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large numbers of people. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artists, who are creating new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a shining figure in the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and set by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently grabbed a Drehorgel and was Drehorgelspieler at the Petersburg, as he has for this difficult role in terms of his art, his philosophy and his image was finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example in amber or Türkis in the city en route? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have the color red, as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society, everything differs from the norm, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> I want my provocations with the people who come into contact. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When will you wusstest, you must be painters? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace, in which my work was issued. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I must go down this road. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I befreundete myself with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; it was a &quot;Puschkinskaja 10,&quot; and then was first brought to an end. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am the theatre, fashion, music, at all, apart from the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this in your Art-Klinik... - it was important, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should meet. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was up to the renovation a musikalisch künstlerischen club for the Boheme, the home of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: N. O. M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, too, such as string with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; was there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> String and his friends sang simple songs on the play back, wearing tight T-shirts and was also the composer Igor Wdowin today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, it was out of its &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachten facilitated many programmes before the era of &quot;Halli-Galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them trachten, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Even the gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club &quot;Griboedov&quot; have their origins in the Art-Klinik. </seg>
<seg id="877"> To have our staff and passengers. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000, there have been in the press a survey, when it comes to the award &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artists of the year,&quot; and so I have reached the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in a new era under the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> Your work has a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are real gems and make clear the timeliness and thoroughness of the ideas expressed. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be an exhibition on the theme of &quot;the Russian Museum as clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> In the past I was social, but now it is painful and is afraid to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blurred and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the absurdity, and I have bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Let us save the world by telling people that everyone has to dress up completely. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now everyone on the clothes and modelled on the exterior, and not on the inside of the human being. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not give a man, but he should face spucken. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception is disappearing through the Verkleiden. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently we saw you in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers - as a cultural city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if I do not? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Commercial art can be nice? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are seeing the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro communities, and it is hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollar notes, which everyone likes it. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you have to think about whom you will like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each country star around 100 followers. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - With regard to the presence of Stas Michailow but several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> He abandoned women, where the sexuell Social sphere plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is based. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth, I have painted these pictures from a collector, even in a number of the works of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images which normally come at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It says: &apos; Intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and money. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture, which I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good. </seg>
<seg id="917"> It says: &quot;Servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not every one of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they will be barred, because there is a need for hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and pave the way forward. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now it is only their own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture, in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Our art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we have become more writers than readers, and this is not true. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will help the city St Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Birth in outer space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with asteroid killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> By guiding caravans of ships with Erdbewohners on board in the search for a replacement planets. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save the human race, the important question is how we are in the catching or on the planets can breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> Many choices are not in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="938"> De facto, there are only two real planets, which we could inhabit at least hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;That is Mars and Venus,&quot; says the scientific staff of the astronomical Vladimir Sternberg-Instituts Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively benign, there is on the surface of Venus with a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, which is in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The issue of reproduction in all of the researchers treated first with regard to the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> As early as half a century before the experiments were carried out with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of peas produced in orbit is not the least of the species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, leier sent into space to explore how the catching impacts on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is becoming a normal chickens. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chickens must be found; it is on its feet and start to move,&quot; explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without fixed underground the chicks beat. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later, stumpften the instincts of the newborn full. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and loud. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Four days later, they simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;Twice we have chickens and then found the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years into the orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But the Biosatelliten &quot;Bion&quot; are only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which had already been fertilised, were sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was found that there was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just about the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the space rats were young. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space, it has not yet been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, which are snatched from their natural habitat, can simply do not follow their reproduction. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to human beings could in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women have been flying for 50 years at all. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk was Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious, humanity is the female organism. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> Will it after this flight can bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, nobody answered this question,&quot; says space veteran guard tang Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after its space flight, bore the first female cosmonaut, vale Christina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 has given birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even work outside of Raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, there remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few Kosmonauts, where, after long flights it all went well, and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is, even in flights to orbit,&quot; Kosmonaut Waleri Poliakov quite rightly concludes, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, the human race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the Erzeugen artificial Gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Hydrolabor in the centre of Kosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in limbo the Kosmonauts routine for the work in open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is catching. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults feel comfortable, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the little Ichtyander testimony that life on the land towards the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic, and that it may be easier to get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is too little time to forget something,&quot; says children&apos;s swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> As for a newborn child, the catching is a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the state of catching the belly and muskulatur basin very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we deal with sending aid. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, in order to extract the baby. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poliakov quite rightly. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the Erdanziehung feeling, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child cannot be in orbit as an adult for training will be put into a suit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He will simply miss what is crucial for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment, which we jointly, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disabled person, a completely unangepaßt man in the world,&quot; says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in outer space theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, but it will be a reality if the people in their space ships on a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ-Chef: control of the black market system failed by fault of politics </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic, in connection with public procurement of good controllers and adequate laws, but falls in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the conversation for Aktuáln, cz says that the vice-president of the Board of Control (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case,&quot; Kala commented on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German investigators. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As a negative example of how practical it brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne?as to the so-called &quot;black system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls, the system is now prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not easy for the government chairman, and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work,&quot; Kala notes. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint tschechisch-deutsches project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other in terms of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was specific? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel examination, with which we started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is important that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts, and that is what we are building on the national legislation and, finally, there is the actual practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> This is all we have compared with each other, and although the test is not yet complete, we saw very interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little &quot;more severe and perfect,&quot; the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules, but we must also deal with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help? What is for you from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is such a common control could help that we stop, we are constantly perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this does not seem particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economics is one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment, or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps it is even the case that the system in this way only with excessive &quot;red tape&quot; burden, and those who are looking for the gaps in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds were higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a similar body like our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the German equivalent to the NKÚ of the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only slightly different, but both authorities in principle are similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is a federal state, which means that these bodies are also in the individual Länder - the German system differs from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in line with our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, where they are subject to the control of the provincial Courts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As far as the German legislation is concerned, which is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would hesitate to compare without specific details, but nevertheless, Germany is in some ways often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany is better at all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Is it perhaps because that is where the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> It is not certain, but as I said, such comparisons, I may not be very happy. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is also important to note that even those countries which are a model for us, also have to contend with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing to do with cooperation with our authority, not true? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority the revision of the procurement law, you have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this revision is in force only a short time, it is in our tests yet. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our inspections take place, you need to be here with a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We feel so far more in the preparatory phase of future controls - as we have the new control instrument &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and with this almost 14 000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes will have an impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions have been modified for certain types of contracts, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with more bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that confirms this assumption. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules will be &quot;tougher&quot; and can no longer be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules, an audit unterzogenen individuals in relation to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable, that any breach of the law on public procurement is tantamount to a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense to make the law more rigorous? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think that in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse, and not punish a procedural mistake, which did not impact on the actual decisionmaking process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system requires only bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us start by which way is not effective. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs are not in control of the so-called &quot;black market system&quot; would reform - what exactly does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> If the system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not simply the government chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We change the law and allow the matter,&quot; but he cannot say that we are doing so as if nothing would be. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone will be excluded because of procedural errors. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I think is missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> In the streets, there is some Eisglätte, they are mostly but dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic, there is some snow and Eisglätte. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Imon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to see positive energy gain </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about it, that in less than a month is due to take place in the world sinking? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those doom, which we humans are so keen to anspringen. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The Tap Tap we are more likely to laugh and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy to stem the global decline, or to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you also carry out a unique project with three concerts against the world&apos;s demise. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you give our readers closer to presenting the project? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide benefiz event, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya-Kalenders, whose end on 21 December at 11:10 o&apos;clock is forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, i.e. on 20 December, from 21:00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be at the time on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a time zone is 12 hours ahead, the maya calendar. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who comes from this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally, we have followed the idea together with our Honza Augusta Grafiker. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In doing so, we would like to not only collect sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the world&apos;s demise, but we also want to, together with the public to think about what condition the world to give our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Maya-Kalenders, we have a unique range of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the world, with its purchase of e-tap.Cz we can also support the people. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The Tap Tap, along with other singers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title &quot;world&apos;s sinking comes from.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Even today, the national anthem is very popular on YouTube; it will also ring out at the benefiz concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, and finally, provided that everything works and the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem of all the singers at all three concerts will be sung at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Moreover, the anthem will be combined in a direct broadcast live by Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus plays in Videoclip Xindl X, singing along with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How are you working with these two? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is connected to many benefiz events and concerts.... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to make these people actively involved in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has shown that most interested in cooperating with us, and we have enjoyed it. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose is the proceeds of the concerts against the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we already have six years together with the club Tap in Jedlika-Institut work. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils of Jedlika-Instituts are regularly cared for by teachers who help them in various leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the Jedlika-Instituts is to create a separate building in which we will move forward with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert, several groups and performers are appearing. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What criteria do you have chosen them? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to set up a programme that addresses all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, are Chinaski, Lesbiens arm, Illustratosphere Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> All the more you know on the website, kpks, cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Are similar &quot;big events&quot; are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are, for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we are preparing an interesting programme for this concert with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we then start in the United States, it would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their plans are not exactly small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with these logistical and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it appears at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the rolling chairs must be transported in the baggage area, and we must, of course, many instruments briefcase and other luggage mitschleppen.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised sometimes in part. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently were, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> By your foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility, as we are dealing with disabled people and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were in Russia just witnessed that everything in the East still is in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> With regard to Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, where it is still unusual, if someone on the bench alone in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not yet again, of course, that you have a wheelchair in the lift vorlässt, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are clubs who are trying to address the problems faced by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And to what extent we have to make up for the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things where we are lagging behind.... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is also important to note, however, that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public sphere, to move into the museum, can use toilets, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not exactly normal, however, that a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social life, we are with the band The Tap Tap the West a little bit ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect in the public domain and accessibility is one thing, but only if our great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only cases of particularly strong personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years ago: what did you in 1998 motivated to create a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> At the time I started in Jedlika-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with a little too busy. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am myself musicians, including Saxofon games, I have, along with a colleague founded a Musik-AG. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and by the time it is, as our presenter, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a runaway (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> It was the band but only in the last few years, or I am wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known Sängers has helped, but we have also begun to actively campaign for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We have become aware that if you do something and the outside is not to see their own performance in a certain sense does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the EU funding, we can be good teachers, good quality equipment and etc.. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Was it your goal, with The Tap Tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the outset, I sensed the potential that we can tackle the things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The branch is now often copied to the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical in its own way, given its novelty with caution, and only after some time will be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of viewers mostly is, of course, sympathy; it is only natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned creatures, which we would regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided that they have the necessary resources to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, not just for themselves, is a step forward, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Was it helpful for this success that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to do something good, we must not compromise on many points and must also demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> This is in my view, but quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and when they discover that they have twice a week to carry out preparatory periods and spend much time on concert tours, then stops the enthusiasm among many quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> That is how it works, but everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At present, The Tap Tap twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the outset, i.e. since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láa Angelovi. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, but the people come and go, and this cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and the desire of collaboration is always welcome to us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> If, rather than on the day before the projected global decline, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9pm </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Venues are as follows: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Brno and Plynojem/Fléda Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians </seg>
<seg id="1192"> All three venues will be linked to the conclusion by live and erklingt a common interpretation of the anthem &quot;sinking&quot; of the band The Tap Tap. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is the funds for the installation of a multifunctional accessible educational center that under the name STUDEO is to be created in Prague in Jedlika-Institut. Cost: CZK 25 million </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entry costs 400 CZK children up to 12 years free tickets are Vorverkauf available at Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the sky. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was at a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, was the ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the ESA and participated in the following years on several ESA-Projekten. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Poland&apos;s path to space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War Polish kosmos fans with space, and so that they do not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> For example, I would like to remind everyone of the presentation of the ternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneering work presented &quot;entrance to the Kosmonautik.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (we. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in his work had shown. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Ternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the Kosmonautik&quot; by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch created Prix REP-Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space has been acknowledged, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Back in April 1925, there was a Eisenbahn-Draisine built in Poland, where a rocket-propelled was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the draft and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket on the launch or on the brakes of the Draisine should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket propelled shells. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the Institute niki Komórka Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The ancient documents show that the research has been spilled into the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the press of mine. Rohoziski a photo elektrischen rocket, and in the following year, the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba i lotnicza,&quot; the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of the Raketenantriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of missile technology from the temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, it was his work, however, from the start of the war to an end. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other articles on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society is taking place in 1954 in the November edition of the journal Problemy, in which four major articles devoted to the space industry. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz, contains the proposal to set up an aerospace company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, there was already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> As early as at its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA for accession to the International Federation for space, founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA has been a member of the autumn of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz zara kiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This office he had until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was carried out on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 6 000 metres was around 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and in 1959, began on the Bdów-Wüste flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 kilometers and for the monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, further development has been halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Successor to the first missiles of the type RM, the Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> This missile has developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are separate from each other in the size of the transport area distinction for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B about 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0,62 per litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude was for all three types of 37 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968, the aviation institute developed the Meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kilograms and was able to take a load of 10 kilograms in a total of approximately 60 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> After that, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 are being built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth pointing out that the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, in which two years later was followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czech Vladimir Remek second kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on voluntary work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision called on the public to have a lively debate. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly an interesting issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is to understand a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition by competition offers &quot; to make a larger market share and to increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital is not a social responsibility, and hence no responsibility for it causes unemployment, necessarily increase government spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is compounded by the fact that, the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus caused overall social economic and social damage. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this stage are superfluous. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital gives the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments are providing their own population without regard to the social consequences to private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected particularly in changes in the existing legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force its own people, the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, through the curtailment of workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there have been a few years in public food distribution for poor people, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people affected are already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly on cases where workers receive such low wages that the state their income must increase to the minimum subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also in the case of staff members working in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all EU-Südstaaten will undoubtedly amount to the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social standards are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance about whom on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This naturally begs the question of where this capital is coming from? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This affects the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital is insisting on his position that the state should not interfere with steering in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then we must ask whether the private capital policy, and thus affects the entire state in its own selfish sense or even draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all lobby in all the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption, mutual preference, a legislative process, in which virtually everything, but nothing is punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry of finance private companies densely intertwined with the industry charged with the drafting of legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These draft laws are subsequently adopted by the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the violence is no longer enough by the people, as Western nations, but also by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It appears that the liberal democracies are quickly caught up in a situation as they Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic to Caesar and pomp &apos;times&apos; describes: &quot;The state has long been in decay, and the posts have been filled by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The corruption rampant, and the people had already bought votes in the election ...&quot;&quot; people with nature is not stopped for offices, so that the state resulting from the decline eight months had no consul... &quot; &quot; you really began to talk about it, that the only medicine in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that there is a strong man to be elected... &quot; Appian pomp &apos;, but the strong man was, after all, Caesar democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> What is clear is that today&apos;s society, as well as in the ancient world to the ruthless preference for their own benefit, without having to pay attention to overall social interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize the benefit of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest effort to make far-reaching reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> From the current state of view, the demise of these regimes can be seen as a pause in liberal democracies, in which the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The most disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to make the social level of people down. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will increase the shareholding of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> ...&quot; That nothing comes from violence, or could ever be created,&quot; Sting sings in the song, whose main verse of the song reads: ...&quot; so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons do not want, there would be no,&quot; says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1949 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> In the wake of the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, a myriad of responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> There are those who stand behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, which committed genocide against the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing more guilty and who is, ultimately, the people who live in Israel, including the self-governing areas born into the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It is a question for me to open the readers behind the scenes, to whom the tension 95 years (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small speck of land in the Middle East in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, while others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question whether it really is the people themselves were autonomous in their steps, or whether someone was behind her throne, drew their actions to a fixed target. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in an era in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resultant power is not within the life span of a generation that has been created. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these astronomical rich families particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the zone (I do not know whether anyone else, but I do not rule this out), the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> But much will not be written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> It is understandable. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters), the Rothschilds have already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to link their name with criminal acts, in light of the consolidation of its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, following the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis, only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has suggested). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused the status of Rothschild Bank of America to renew as the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (read: government) to release notes and 1865 murdered in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J. F. Kennedy began to publish their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; Mr. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Pik, a Masonic of the 33rd and highest level of recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was aimed at eliminating the big monarchistisch state of Europe, with the second war, in particular the British colonial rule, is to be broken, and the third war, the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their benefits and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the runup) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method with which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (chao - order from the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like those of them in 1907 caused no repeat). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded Germany&apos;s capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Russian empire, the war is no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower was ungarns. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> DISCARDED </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historic Judäas area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the precondition for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke from the chain, which had initially kept the international bankers, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, created the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as by the reparations war against Germany, is preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people along the lines of the Second World War to the victims in the frontline battle, this time, along with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (as people sharply divided into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice is wrong in an endless spiral of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> DISCARDED </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of aristokraten. </seg>

<seg id="1334"> It is a man&apos;s figure, and his number is six hundred taking sixty six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood appeal </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> For their release they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi have had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the Patronat of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American government, there has been no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as the confidence of its allies have been severely damaged in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage exemption made everything worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages at home called a wave of solidarity, as well as Iranian sentiments. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The Argo film by the director and Schauspielers Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small partial victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff on the flight. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> This ended after numerous delays in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According to the CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, and helped them an extravagant story on the Verdeckung of their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the alleged plot locations visited for a science-fiction movie. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of Genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The expert on &quot;Exfiltration,&quot; Tony Mendez, developed plan also made Hollywood&apos;s cooperation necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> This means that the camouflage was credible, published articles on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of this operation were long kept secret, but the film is based on the memory of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called &quot;Caper Movie,&quot; i.e. the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the own scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, ironic and slightly excessive. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits at the table, at the flurs office, on the phone.... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck is a remarkable start with this film of his career success. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> A derided actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third movie after the thrillers no pushover (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in Boston by the director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the previous films by this director of standard Hollywood -- contrasted with. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is proof of this sensitivity, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada &quot;played.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have actually taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its simplicity, and gives the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictable nature, which, if the story. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck with his team, even in fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with that history does not really many exciting moments in the cinema. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> With the little he has been working quite successfully, and he sometimes helps the reality - which has not always been so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran will be averted by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, are a bit curious). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to spend a lot of action in many places to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood officials are very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and so that they are in the film far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film that it loses a little traction, and it is a film with some interest and the design and the Retro-Stil, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years goutieren. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Enthusiasm, however, makes it difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a day in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for the Aufblasen of balloons, for bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server bankovnipoplatky, an annual survey on the oddest bank fees devoted, decided this year, the competition &quot;absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;This idea has brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU, a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organization of this poll, compared with the newspaper Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated aberrations, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of social security charges for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> In the meantime, women enjoyed life insurance an advantage, because they are objective for the insurance companies pose a lower risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Further incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated until the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013,&quot; Nacher said. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol for fuel, which is natural in its wake, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because of the eggs in this year were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism has in the past as well as the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter&quot; or even the sales ban on conventional incandescent bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas must be 14 cm </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries (the Czech Republic is currently trying to, for example, with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also behind this, that bananas of the highest class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not a &quot;size abnormality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended with the argument that it merely inconsistent harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules on fruit and vegetables were made by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> One candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year, the balloons in the sale must be accompanied by pointing out that children under eight years ago the air balloon must not be allowed without supervision of an adult aufblasen. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU called for an American study, according to balloons, are the leading cause of the suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Kuriose incursions are also at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd is also a directive, which the European officials themselves - anyone who plays an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece does not use the name Macedonia, and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky, named in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez fair, in addition to the above-mentioned aberrations, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic exceeded the prescribed amount for canned mushrooms, for which we have a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries money should be given to ensure that they do not have a sea, or the idea to provide funding for applications for funding. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels, but also from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are penalized because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will be at the EU&apos;s request for reimbursement,&quot; in autumn 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The argument led to the cereal harvest was very high, and the state camps were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Since the Czech Republic has another route to ports, the EU should Palas several hundred million euros to pay us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far that it is a call for tenders organised on the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for grants from the local authorities, the Ministry of Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel Nmec (US-DEU), it should be specific about funding for the establishment of financial aid applications to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations will be easy in the Member States to the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation, and thus also for efficiency and the development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to these experts is more EU funding for projects which nothing, together with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were imposed by individual member countries. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions at home also raises the fact that the Czech Republic like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products must fight and this fight does not always win. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term &apos;Olomoucké tvarůžky&apos; defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský sold short), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to &quot;Tuzemák&quot; redefined. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name rum is only allowed for products from sugar cane destillat to be used for products from sugar beet. </seg>

<seg id="1411"> &quot;People want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur,&quot; Okamura said. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. Senator, how is the idea to stand for the office of the president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not for me to be a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything in our country would work without problems, I would get nowhere to stand. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see how the republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while the taxes and the retirement age will be increased. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something which I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am already more than 40, and independent and French departments, I have no other way to influence the situation than for the senator or the president to stand for election. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have succeeded, and then on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> You will not let your constituents back? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have told the whole time that the battle for the Castle will begin after the outcome of the senatorial election. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have clarified this and said that I will be standing for the office of the President, if I am elected to the senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function and the function is an instrument with which I can achieve my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> For that I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and on the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Then there are the media who want to deprive the privilege and freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse them. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me, for example, it has been claimed that I would be bribed or that I was by Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Are we talking about your dreams. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive assets of over 20 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To this end, you must change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How are you going to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As an ordinary citizen, I have argued that the travel officer remains a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and it is only on the population. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party, I have a far greater potential support from all the parties represented in Parliament to win. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am without schublade thinking and party dogma from any party that can take what is the best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather than the right or the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people would rather see the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> I find this left-right thinking but completely irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right wing; I would like to bind the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I am always in public every good solution, even if this KSM or of the ODS, and I am opposed to bad ideas as well. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> I hate you if someone described you as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you do not confirm this by what you just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have a goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And do you want to get closer to this. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> One may describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by key experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament you are only buzzwords. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And if you are in politics not long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people, we will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side, in order to achieve these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would not be a problem for me, the leader of the parliamentary parties live on television to call the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to lay down the law. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And then, if necessary, the Angesprochenen would have to say why they do not. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which draws attention to grievances, can exert pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Look at the direct election of the president, who was a result of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> In politics, I have only just begun and I am trying for my programme to find the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the situation itself; and if it does not work, then I would go in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This sounds a bit as if Okamura save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I am not alone; that is why I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I spoke with Radim Janura, for example, but refused because of overwork. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jan?a Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have chosen most representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are just two independents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen such a composition that changes will be very difficult to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county chief leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the establishment of a separate party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought, because I have no time to check every potential party member, and do not have the money to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for the presidential campaign; my transparent accounts are no more than 20 000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You are talking about asset declarations, how would you? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> My property value at approximately CZK 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a piece of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for around 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million worth, as well as an Ashton Martin for 3.5 million, and a kodu Superb, around a million is worth, and then I have a couple of million in the bank account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Ashton Martin was, in fact, a childhood dream - James Bond liked me always, as he was driving in the car, was galant for women, and at the same time fighting against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You are a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the republic, but your own money you do not want to invest. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I did not have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> What I am going to make debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme may not be too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senator content I could not live alone, such as my son, I could not finance the English school, the 30 000 per month costs. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If you continue to act as a businessman, in order to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Are you saying that you are going to cut back these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have my activities partially scaled down. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, for example, my deputy director in the spring of the travel office. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want to see me as a Samaritans, who saved the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must also live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> At which monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Approximately 200 000 to 400 000, and this is still the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I would stop my actions. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The complete conversation you find in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure is not only in mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created book - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and once again there is something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the roadside. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: &quot;But it is nice, the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> They all have the Internet, iPad and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is still voluntary in one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little survey sleeping town before the Rotterdams doors, is an odd record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80 000 inhabitants municipality has the lowest rate in the entire Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to counteract this unfortunate circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven imaginary bridges, which are described in the notes, a handsome bepinselt de Stahlbetonminiaturen. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the education campaign has remained in check. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers realized that there were only one way of statistics: a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architectural office, master of the audacity Balkenende diagramme and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003 with five books at arm and a grin on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked bewildered and while &apos;perspiration&apos; zuckte, stapelte of the impudent Maas his fine Mitbringsel the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch speech with the words: &quot;Love urban community.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> This is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeke mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few adjacent homes and houses with a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, with the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot; excellent. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nomination in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is the faceless small town retorte, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suggest a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: eldorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift to the middle of massive mountain, but the real space and happiness in the fußläufig climbing the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The strengthened compartment is bright and clear, the klinke bed and the elegant street taking unambiguously speak the language of a public city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking for dog and football playing boys and Mädels. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And, everywhere, books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle, there is a large, dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic konfiguration upside down and the reading of externally imposed. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the bergs book is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technology center. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, verkleidung, Brüstung, stieg. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Pulp, Haptik and smell are alien. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and Bauingenieure shake of the unknown material the head. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trouborst, project manager for the local community Spijkenisse, to question the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen farming one day on a suitable by-product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, they used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields, a millimeterdünnes plastic vlies as a root canal. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> This is cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The dünne textile holds a two Saisonen, then it is ripe for the Sperrmüll. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - about four centimetres thick plates. </seg>

<seg id="1541"> After 105 stages, we reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 metres long schaft will be in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch Krokettes and eingetopft Ficusbäumen. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right air humidity in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe, but this House is, despite the many glass spaces a flagship project in terms of ecology,&quot; Trouborst says. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> It will be Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book is under a glass crash, the sun shines, even on sunny days only briefly in the home. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad Holzleimbinder, which are all on the outside glass, serve as a Beschattung and catch a large part of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest get automatically built. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT sector, have already dared the way into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Even Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And Cynthia TCM-Lehrerin Bogarde, the boeke mountain as a Spijkenisses &quot;long overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: in order to open up a few weeks ago, each resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This should start the optical gaps in the not yet fully library - currently 70 - will be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is good enough. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled by obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents to have a certain relationship with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his books are part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only for grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This MVRDV has been the central discipline in jargon called identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has literary history written. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> That is how young and uneducated it may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is at last a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo said: &quot;Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has been in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europäische relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> German wave: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it opposed the request for observer status of the Palestinian people would vote at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Then there was Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> It is now time for Germany, because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be cautious. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was, after all, enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany, where it is difficult to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it is surrounded by its foreign policy and away from a policy which has been gemanaged by the United States, towards a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are among the sides. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the path to becoming a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, such as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What constitutes a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy as concrete from a German perspective? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent differently than those of the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Have these economic interests to influence the stance on the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> This is why it must be careful that the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to offend. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, this is playing a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, which is not a completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by important decisions to abstain in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is great sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> This is why I do not believe that this was a very dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for einspielen. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it is a signal that it will be taken seriously as an international player, and its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States has clearly expressed its support for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Are there any differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In view of the US domestic policy, these differences still exist. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government of President Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government in public, of course, does not represent this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as large as they always seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic about Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> If Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is exactly what we are doing with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> That, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself in its role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is Germany, the leadership is still serious? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to, which is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German sentiments. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That makes it not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is actually the old problem: you are not surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> In this respect, Germany is in a much tougher position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It is sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU currently fills this void but not who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a larger role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like it, they are uncomfortable, and makes them much less popular - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together on the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialises in German politics, foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> There is an officially registered name across China, which does not have anything to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Yet it is so long as the real names do not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether they are right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, the protection of rights abuses in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The Nachahmers are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their names. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> It is simply out of Gucci Lu-Gucci, rather than Prada Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Similarly, German companies will be legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> This opens up a file with information of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese champion in copying and injured intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are mehrstöckig supermarkets, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pocket cases are different: on behalf of his clients, however, that Chinese companies from the Trademarks Agency officially received the right to use a name, which already is protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call the &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; a passenger name. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> This means that women who are wealthy men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are not aware </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;This is harmful, we must fight it,&quot; calls for stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be diluted, the damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are going into the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But Löschungen dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years, the process can drag on, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Reports of cases in which complaints prompted the court, because after the long duration of the name of &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff bad luck, he had the Plagiator even pay money because he violated its brand in China, says this hole. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases include graphic details. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the baumaschinen manufacturer Sany, the company, which was recently the German champion, pumpen took over. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must now use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue white logo, which reminded us of BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely has had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile could look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are not aware. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademarks Agency in Beijing CTMO is that 2010 due to reduced personnel and equipment shortages. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year was one of the &quot;emergency business returned to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> The unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, there are still 81 500 objections to settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> By contrast, it costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often happens in China, the figures are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year, the CTMO is more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and meant that China, for the tenth consecutive year the list of Neuanmeldungs around the world, shares with the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademark, a total 5.5 million piece. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Simplified, this means that each registering an average of 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> On the other hand, it would cost many times, as in the case of the German family company the mountain shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts has been unearthed. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the followers pledged to keep the Chinese rights to the brand of joy. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed, because in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of the Chemical speciali ties in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademarks Agency CTMO rejected the objection of Munich as well. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies, the mountain is right, but the trial is still continuing. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You have to watch your step </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us much time, money and nerve.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could not quantify the company&apos;s archives have even a hundred years old files to prove them. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, the mountain on the other side in vain for a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; to settle. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much it is worth,&quot; Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East are even zurückzuschwappen in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, when there are imitators unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, known as the mountain of shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This business has long since abandoned the company, but he was able to avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You have to watch your step,&quot; Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer advising German companies for doing business with China to be very careful. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but rather should foreigners ,&quot; everything is somehow worthy, even in China,&quot; Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if the mountains in the last act of his Markendramas, then we should do the opposite fees pay for your own name, Wentzler said. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be forced out of the market in this segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Aids Day: Stampfen, sing, help </seg>

<seg id="1710"> The 50 sänger and singer came between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the householder. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&quot; Obani &quot; is not an easy piece, every vote has a different text and still in a very foreign language: Zulu, the 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland. </seg>

<seg id="1713"> Worldwide, there are around 34 million people, the Unaids estimates that the programme of the United Nations on the Bekämfung of AIDS. </seg>

<seg id="1722"> The bantu tongue fluid can no one in this room, but sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this alien soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> 8 733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Some 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm and Strohhütten, a large part of them are children. </seg>

<seg id="1729"> Cuts back to the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion has been shown to reduce the half, are hardly accepted by the population. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of people in Swaziland have the immunschwäche virus to die in 30 is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In the case of a joint African tour in the spring of 2005 was the chorus the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply to everyone: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without education, people in a poor country still have no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was the personal involvement of individuals, for a few euros per year to send a child to school and give him a warm meal on the day. </seg>

<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Bacterial TSIs include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral TSIs are HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasitic TSIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the main stakeholders involved? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper are mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Institute estimates that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Among the heterosexual adults is that of chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren often used sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV is by heterosexual adults comparatively small - yet: around 20 per cent of the organised in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> That of chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other communities. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here, there are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people often. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections developed? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of organised goes back since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there have been around 9 000 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about a tenth of less than a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases in genital ulcers can be besch in Urinieren, a product bauchschmerzen, as well as Bläschen or Warzen. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> As part of the pathogen of sexually transmitted diseases, including Schmierinfektions and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> I therefore recommend that experts in particular often rotating Sexpartnern regular check-ups. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Early diagnosis can most TSIs cured and will be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> By inconsistency, donations and not least the advantageous chorus in Germany, ersingt, is a great deal together. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;Overall, we have already had some EUR 200 000 sent to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the club. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> They are also concerned that the orphans are well, with one of the grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, known as the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans to give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day on time for school. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Anyone who has no one comes to the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who is being paid by the club as well as the two Köchins every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and together with the American health organization PSI organized that many people in the village have a HIV-Test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a foregone conclusion, because it appears the disease throughout the country, it is silent they prefer dead. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> In fact, strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also the state contained lifestyle that HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But many migrant workers, who carry the virus through the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz,&quot; but they are hardly used. </seg>

<seg id="1791"> The probe was evidence found that in the region of the planet constantly overshadowed by the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This is expected to at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably came from comets, or possibly even Asteroiden, which are followed by the Merkur. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one is bringing the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our insights into space: the main Teleskops </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope is 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented - even before Galileo Galilei a year later to star observation. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of optical Teleskops and more - and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> 30 years from 1947 to 1975, which was Hale-Teleskop in Palomar-Observatorium near San Diego, the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular cope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It leaves gaze into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner life of the Gran Telescopio recognise on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large &apos; cope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of around 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Part of the design, the telescope has locked us into, in his view - and thus limited in his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Even the Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is in the picture. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its specificity: the high power. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is not enough - despite comparatively small diameter - in which the world&apos;s largest teleskope. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) told investigators that all signs. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The teleskop radio has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the case of the &quot; Search for terre trials Intelligence (SETI) can help every computer owner by computing power available. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Look at the Observatory of European Star () in the chile Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> This is the Very Large cope - worthy of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four does the cane can also ausleuchten the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Also on the Chilean ESO-Observatorium, the European Extremely Large cope plan. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is fed up with 42 metres - and nearly 1 000 mirror elements will be taken together. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> With pictures until at least 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> By 2007 the two keck teleskope in the hawaii diminishes volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They offer the same two mirrors with an average of 10 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The keck teleskope are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums, along with them with the Subaru-Teleskop and the IRTTF in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Even at the Mauna Kea is supposed to create a new giant telescope - with a durchschnitt from 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> In this regard, it is an illustration to marvel at. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The main impressions from the space, the Space teleskop Hubble discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990, it is already pictures of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space teleskop for extrasolaren planets - mainly for those who are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates since the beginning of the mission have been detected. </seg>

<seg id="1869"> The primary level of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: it is in the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists assume that even at the South Pole of Merkur ice exists. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no reliable data for this, because the measurement is far closer to the North Pole hover around the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements have been around for decades suggest that there is ice on the Merkur. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> The 2004 launched messenger probe - the first to hover around the Merkur - the scientists have now certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum for longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search in the country in which 97 people are still comparatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The Kleinbus rumpelt on the road over densely wooded hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, you might think that you would have been in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> This is the Caucasian population of Talyschen, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfect Persian, as well as Aserisch and is very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small city flaunts powerful architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe hardly come here is too onerous for the journey from Azerbaijan capital, Baku. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only a single track. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The fabulous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik is the stuff of tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; Fatulayeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum for longevity, is probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the Vita of approximately eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented more than 100 Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years, a child conceived </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A birth certificate, however, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;1805 here he was born in the region, and in 1973 he died,&quot; Fatulayeva explained. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man has been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years ago, he is still a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has irali Müslümov in his age for a few decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;What is striking, there are also many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, in Japan or in Hunza-Tal in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> In the absence of documentation, however, is not a scientific proof of the age, particularly because civil records were missing. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day becher melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik is remarkably often a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> At present there are 20 people who are older than 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why are so many Hochbetagte in the south? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri leader Farid Mugimzadeh said that with the particular genes of the Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it is up to the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But the high-calorie diet of Talyschen is to be healthy, meat, bread and, above all, love dairy products, and many of them every day and drink a glass melted butter, seems to be dietary not plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original lifestyle, which keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In its 97 years for these regions it is still comparatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> It sits on the ground with a butter barrels before they tirelessly and herrollt. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Even two toddlers jump around. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> The kitchen is preparing the tea, which will be served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gläsern. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in form and link, under her headscarf, her long, dark blond remained, her son proudly unveiled before us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, so they were never told me and kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;Shampoo I have never been used,&quot; Mirzayeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> My entire life I have not once bought in the supermarket food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then they were told by her husband in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the period after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyew, took the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, which is being driven by the father figure of the nation, which his country ruled as a dictator, knows little borders in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Until 2003 he was in power, who later took his son Ilham the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan elderly people. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), will receive Mirzayeva monthly pension, for a sum here, of which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps Mirzayevas has long grey son right: &quot;Old people enjoy respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in the middle of the big family, to be loved, cared and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human rights&quot; is lacking in the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution with Sharia law as a basis is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president&apos;s signature is not with emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to make the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but probably mainly to the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and Säkularen. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because they all have been hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by mercies of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> He said Mohammed Mursi almost compromise temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers, &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what of the 61 year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite aware. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Should the judiciary be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles of the Islamist-dominated 100 000-strong gebends assembly in a late-night, Parforceritt 15 hours were pushed through, in part, worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, it is also in the draft law based on the &quot;principles Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is called &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and is open to interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists, the ambiguous wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will be used. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least a new article suggests: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-Ashar-Universität must be drawn, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great clout in the entire Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This is not, but it may mean that the clerics oversee the legislation, which de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary would entail. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf interpretation is </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: the civilian military justice system is to continue to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts have been used during Mubarak&apos;s rule for the suppression of opposition brought. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator who sat down to 11 000 civilians in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state should also, as it says in the draft, &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; protect &quot;and promote their morality and their values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is legal so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain language, this is nothing more than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> No article, moreover, explicitly stipulates the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> It prohibits the prophet Muhammad and his envoys to insult or slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult, and how it is to be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally dubious is the wording of &quot;insulting people&quot; should be banned. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> If there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at cost of a jurist? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Mursi for his signature before and after his words &quot;very soon,&quot; the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the charter even before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, third platzierter of the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize winner and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution was &quot;on the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via intelligence service Twitter he accused Mursis supporters, a &quot;coup against democracy&quot; to take. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he has declared the referendum, we will go to his palace and put him down,&quot; said the opposition persuade Yasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that the referendum failed to monitor want, which means it would be invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated, for their part in the counter-demonstration, precaution, but not at the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Nilufer in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many veiled women and supporters of Salafisten attended and said: &quot;The people are calling for the application of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They called Mursi: &quot;Säubere the country!&quot; and beteuerten: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably be the war-like situation. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The Mursis supporters were obviously not at risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now it is time that the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> A majority vote for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The word &apos;human rights is not even before&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have until February and should involve all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The 48 year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned under Mubarak or were in court. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> It is not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For that he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the word&quot; human rights are not even in the new constitution, &quot;he complained in conversation with the&quot; world on Sunday. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Mursi power expansion in all three branches of the state could be resigned to the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Rather than to strengthen civil society, the President de facto repealed,&quot; complained Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> But without civil society organisations could not function like a democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could backfire. </seg>

<seg id="2009"> There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which is simply not going to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is with salt bestreut trout, which - depending on how his stinking fish would like - up to a year in water will be fermented. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> If the darkness in Norway over the country, and the weather will be colder, Norwegians on a celebration here in Fagernes, this is really a very alluring specialty. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw and carries it with a glass of aquavit anymore,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called &quot;Rakfisk-General&quot; also organized the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> In order to have people eat small fish cube and take large quantities of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk,&quot; Havard says. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The label can crowd out the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I cost some pausing. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it avoids the Rakfisk in its nose, it is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which is a very long trip. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in dense salt water barrels was wet. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> In the deepest winter then he was removed after a long fermentation and, no doubt tempered by using alcohol consumed. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in the search for work forced to leave their country and emigrate from mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not long ago was much richer than Norway, immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly part of Norwegian history. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> He is among the more expensive dishes that you can buy here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But in fact this is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich that costs 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here we hate it still, in contrast to Breivik naming and shaming - those racist right-wing extremist, last year 77 men, women and children shot. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it refers only to the &quot;incident of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is able to such brutal killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main responsibility for the current wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waiter, who distributed some tablets with mature Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and the gut-wrenching blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are, as we say, prudent people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Your English is just as most people here are impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not very angeberisch, we may not be boasting. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway is very cautious in dealing with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry profits will be for the benefit of future generations invested in a special fund. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis with money that they do not have kept Norway closed its wallet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we ski in winter and summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And, of course, Rakfisk dinner,&quot; she adds with a smile. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and put me in a different court - I have had enough of Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> For example, a moose burger is in any case something else, and the hefty meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But the evening is once again Stinkefisch on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several sorts who organise a Rakfisk-Dinner in which guests for the best - or perhaps the good smell the most challenging - fish can vote. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a Live-TV-Schaltung on a fly clad show master, who is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What have you up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;These are our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Applause and laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man who falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> But perhaps it is the strict cloud of the whole fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival, Will Grant from the BBC the forthcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of its people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> At present, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is a always congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel erected several important transport routes in the capital, absperrt, and on the streets for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto, the presidential binde and the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government, Felipe Calderon&apos;s economic Mexico has been able to work well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence,&quot; Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, was Pena Nieto as governor of his home State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, vast part of the country, which surrounds the capital, are the different views on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town del Valle bravo, for example, is remembered fondly of him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents of the tourist location write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways, Pena Nieto and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which it once was. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Badges with his name are also outside of a modern sports centre and a powerful interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect real and lasting changes,&quot; his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI is working. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, as regards the security and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000, replaced by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The accusations made by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, above all, but he is also someone who can listen to me. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could contrast to the paved streets of Valle del bravo not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under motorway führungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are of crucial urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> At the beginning of this year, the military intervened to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a spot fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens murdered women left behind. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, killed more than 1 000 women in Mexico state - a statistic that even the city Ciudad Juarez, which for its violence and the killings of innocent women is notorious. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The Pena Nietos critics are of the view that he is the problem of feminicide during his term at least, is not adequately addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia is wrestling with the tears when she photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of events, according to Mariana 2010, has committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed,&quot; remembers Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had already been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, gazing from the wall a picture of Mariana down to us, but it is appropriate, in addition to a cross, which bears a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But this is precisely what the family have been denied until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me when I was a Schwätzerin, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not possible if there were so many flaws and omissions,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto on Saturday receives the presidential binde so that he is also assuming a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crimes, and the new president has promised, during his tenure, particularly in order to deal with this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope he is as president, as he as governor was,&quot; says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But is afraid the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The prosecutor alleges that Bradley Manning did not abuse besch </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutor Bradley contradicts Mannings allegations that he had been mistreated in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The hearing deals with Mannings in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense seeks dismissal of the indictment due to harsh prison conditions </seg>
<seg id="2101"> According to the US Army Corporal is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents to </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecutor has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - indicted for the biggest disclosure of confidential information in the US history, missed several opportunities to complain about allegedly suffered mistreatment in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> In a cross-examination Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents on weekly visits to the prison officers during Mannings nine-month prison in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> A day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defence for the dismissal of the indictment was held - by the harsh prison time Manning had already been punished enough, Manning had testified that he would have been considered in prison suicides. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> According to the US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his time in Iraq thousands of confidential documents were stolen. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks Manning as a source of information has never been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday with Manning went through the forms, the officials after their meetings with Manning had been filled out during his detention in Quantico-Militärgefängnis, where he from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions had been satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers to. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein on Friday quizzed him on the forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by the institution as a whole as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms contained no complaints about abuse, even though the Manning officials had directly asked about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said that he had verbally expressed his concerns and that the officials had discussed with him and to deal with them, but they have not been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (after meeting the concerns),&quot; no problems ,&quot; and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Col. Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he did not besch about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicide should investigate. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said his intention during this meeting have been his status for the &quot;prevention of injury&quot; downgrading. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that it was him that restrictive status - a level below the suicide risk, and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to convince people that it was a good thing, and get rid of the observer status for the prevention of violations (...) to achieve a higher quality from my perspective, to achieve,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months was detained before he in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico naval base in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat again. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not knowing what with him or in the outside world, was costly. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell on Camp Arafjon, in the same cage,&quot; Manning said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning had the bulk of his time spent in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> It gave him only a mattress, a blanket, Flip-Flops, clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or only. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He was always forced to sleep with the light from the outside in his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If he had turned back at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was buoyant, so that he is back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011, Mannings lawyers formally objected to the Mannings. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning in the military prison of Fort leave worth Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge quizzed Manning also on a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday - he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in a morning count before guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity to umhüllen with his blanket. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he had ordered his guards closed the ceiling, with which he could have, but he admitted that he had not called upon to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to do so in the previous night to sleep naked; he had previously tried to show an official that he is not a threat to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said the official, he would have the backing of his underwear or his Flip-Flops can use to injure himself, but this is not done. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> On this night, Manning said, his underwear, Flip-Flops and glasses have been removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention and will drastically reduce his prison sentence, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has indicated that Manning committed minor offences guilty, while other charges, which are regarded as too extreme to be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor is expected to have a justification of the detention conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the rules, which apply to all prisoners incarcerated under the highest safety precautions in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he in all charges was found guilty, he faces a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> I am between Mexico and amerikanische identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people are due to the lack of opportunities being forced to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times to remember, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans between two worlds are caught </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just traversed the Hall and had arrived at the passport control, as confusion was widespread in me. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Placards referred to two lines: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there a few seconds long, uncertain about which I should come. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and was my entire life called &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic acronym - as well as my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York call &quot;Italians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I decided to &quot;between Mexico and America.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But Mexico was here. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for Kürzels or slashed. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I am speaking Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language at both ends of an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am not going on. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took up my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about the moment after this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues, which we expected when the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, but it is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc, according to a model of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico&apos;s war against the drug cartels, even though he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848, and the leadership of the country under a gun forced more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event cannot be overlooked. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> As soon as a US official only mildest criticism in Mexico, we are told, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - will be besch about how the Americans press the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And monte zumas are moving on the path of war. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Yet it is the biggest challenge facing Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Inclination to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country opens, and others, for whom it does not do this. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our tree a person - perhaps a parent or parent - no chance in Mexico and got in on the road north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person had a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is important to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> It is not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Although we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes perhaps blurred, but what our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This clearly applies to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not be. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> You can see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look to us because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico have never been strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we are not behind the silk curtains - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States, einwanderte reminded me that tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this seriously. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While US citizen, sees it as part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling that neither to be part of the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in any one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are going to be seen as an American. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are going to be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the chattering classes would resume their ties to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to see Mexican Americans as a provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We are supposed to tell our American colleague about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injured. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid, as you alone, cronies. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are still not ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico in a century and a half, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grievance for how their family members have been treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Maybe we are &quot;of Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old, new in the Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for the peace process </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But even though the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict, appear to be changing the Middle East around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want to or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally reach its end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is neither lost nor won </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week&apos;s clashes have strengthened the Hartgesottenes on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip, will claim that the Israelis have diminished, even though his group itself has seen huge losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolat and dense bevölkert corners of the planet will be packed, Israel has so far not been able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas in the West Bank, which the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah will be controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> For example, as Islamists have gained in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and rich friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power, which was once seen as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubelnde Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly more Islamist Stürzung Bashar&apos;s could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the world&apos;s largest and most important Arab country - on Israel&apos;s southern flank has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his ouster in 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and its leaders more dependent on public opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The Israeli hardliners, however, make an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defence system, the &quot;Iron Dome,&quot; has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more easily. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms the United States remain steadfast in its position, but many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest Gewalteskalationen. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel is well handed down in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed around 30 Israelis, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared unconstitutional, but always be further developed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is good, and his Likud Party has been in the runup to the elections on 22 January, with Avigdor Lieberman allied with a kämpferisch group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why is this insidious nanny Palestinians and give them a separate state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they really control over the West Bank, then they would not be just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip, including the firing rockets? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, they should not dare to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but the Arab Spring could make a line through the bill. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the problems in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The Israeli defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower, the new Arab governments will hardly help to rebuild their economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The fact that the pragmatic President Barack Obama oust with Mursi, in order to reach a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Even the Israelis should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost from the outside world </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The right answer is those of the sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the outside world and will be represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders have more influence on the implementation of this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by regional exchanges and a united Jerusalem, to convince. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for un-beobachter status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama must also do its part to push Israel into negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far in the White House, it seems as if he were just as opposed to a participation. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging in force </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packets, which are the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia, in order to brand logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, oliv green lid, which are also printed with graphic images, which sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick infants and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Among the various health warnings and pictures, apart from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs of the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This means that Australia is the world&apos;s most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian Federal Government wants to see young people smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco use will be eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, with 99% probability will no longer start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can already see in children young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to compete with their brand image,&quot; Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quotes studies, for example, have shown that children are the crown of a logo associated with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little effect on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> For example, it was said that the legislation would encourage the black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the rules have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha of Zico Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone cap to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian Court failed with its appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6 000 units sold in wholesale shops and waiting for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Experts say that is the flaw in the popularity of social media in precisely the population group, in which the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number australischer laws, tobacco companies banned from the TV-Werbung, it forbids them to act as a sports sponsors, and the vast majority of traders being forced to sell cigarettes in shops no longer to be interpreted, and now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sides, but has no influence on the international side. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Who left tobacco marketed and only a small area, in order to advertise its products, is not on the Internet,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> In the social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook gave Freeman an increase of feedback on brands identified by &quot;ordinary people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It is the question: is it just a private individual who so much likes marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco says that the industry, rather than concentrating on marketing to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules, those countries complain about unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization, even though none of the countries increased trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO ruling is expected in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which are considering similar legislation. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to mandating photographic warnings. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> In the meantime they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are being contemplated in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;It is simply a bad way, and the box is away,&quot; says Victor El Hage with the purchase of a cigarette packet on which a photograph is printed with a mouth tumor. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the tobacco trade &quot;King of the Pack&quot; in the inner city of Sydney, says that the single packaging was stacking his shelves more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;In the past, I have spent an hour with a einzusortieren delivery, and now I do not need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have cigarettes simply completely ban - then we would have said okay, that&apos;s it, we are close,&quot; he adds visibly angry. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constant air world, it is nice to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This thank giving, I spent five hours at the airport, when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> I had enough time to give me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> A half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervous killing - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, duty-free shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and child development experts have boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - OK, sometimes bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This means that the brain is forced to lose in interesting ideas, which may promote the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us today are almost always on the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom is no longer available. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should therefore welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> This is what I would like to come back. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011), this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom is a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The Pompejis signs a Latin inscriptions about boredom, which originates in the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then there is the question as to how we boredom actually define. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. East wood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada says that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor East wood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, &quot;a satisfactory job to do, but not to be able to define what it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from apathy to the effect that the person is not employed, but he wants to. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> In the case of apathy, however, there is no desire to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The experience of boredom, he says, is in a &quot;disruption of the interest process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can listen almost as much as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor East wood believes, even though these two conditions could see bored people the problem in their area or the world, while the problem people see in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even though we have very difficult to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention&quot; - German, for example: &quot;The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor East wood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazin article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television channel from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content; others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear this noise at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who were barely audible television, saying they were more boring than the two other groups - they have had problems to focus, for no reason and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If, however, a dull professional activity, &quot;such as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor can distract music and help not bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by people who are physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit,&quot; Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We are all at some point boring - my delayed flight, a sensational loudspeaker, a particularly tedious film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people bore more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a &quot;scale of boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale, there are statements such as &quot;many things that I must do is repeat and monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests, that I was not enough time for all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West florida, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larsen who, professor of human and gemeinwesen development at the University of Illinois, through an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a Pager kontaktierte. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in school and let the house were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents said they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larsen who says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom has risen or fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he is sure that &quot;youth is seen as particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back then, on my original question: is boredom healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to alleviate them, the studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand look at many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity, and this view is Professor Vodanovich, who studied for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom, the brain is to say that you should do something else,&quot; Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what you should do best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is boring and the energy used to play and cook Gitarre, will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can make short-term sense, they vanish over the long term but again. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> If his bored child is an iPad enough, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;Self-regulation is transferring from a situation to the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to entertain, but it also receives more self-regulation in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Similarly, we should not be critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant Aktivitäts and berieselung at ease. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor East wood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that people really just want to find a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19 year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few marijuana stones and a pipe with which he rauchte. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> According to Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag car in Lamar near the border with Kansas en route, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer marijuana was found in the car, Orozco was summoned to the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - kavalier offences, each with a penalty of 100 Dollar - and received a court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on the law in hundreds of minor drug offences, and the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of regulatory offence for marijuana, here and in Washington state approved similar measures that have already been dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years ago is no longer in possession in small measure, which is allowed by law, once the new laws in force in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the even more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to follow up on existing marijuana offences and who are still living in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time voting in several cities, from the Denvers suburbs to the Western Mountain, new state licensed marijuana shops to stop at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation continues to evolve so quickly that I do not know what will happen as the next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in Washington state are perplexed at the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have set a deadline until 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, it is of the view that Colorado, in any case, most states, and the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only for medical purposes, and then for private consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and the state is therefore good for guidance,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the regulatory authority for spirits in Washington state. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent which we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, is on 6 December in force and is also the end of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practical issues must be resolved at this time, for example, as the state requirement of &quot;adequate access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis in the radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, jobs and child care facilities should be agreed upon. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere is it more difficult to find a location for a lizenziertes cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the densely populated area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the &quot;Center for Legal cannabis,&quot; a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November sent Chief Oates an Email to his staff in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would minor marijuana trafficking in people over 21 years ago is no longer, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; no criminal charges will be sought for these offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban targets to regulate growers of medical marijuana will be enforced and drug traffickers continue to be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney General Ken buck a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he gave his authority would continue to monitor of marijuana possession, mainly to get consumers to the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana on trial, even though many have been charged for other crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations, in which it was committed to the tatzeit,&quot; the buck has said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions are, even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, shows an adult in the possession of small quantities no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to do so, not all outstanding proceedings to be dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I don&apos;t waste my time in order to enforce the law until it is changed,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure that was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana to reconcile with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions across the state encouraged among local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the great green experiment to date. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> District prosecutors if it is a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, the defendants for marijuana offences in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the National Organization for reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute that they still cannot accept,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states, smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, are going to deal with Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age legal sale, they are also nervous on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several high-profile arrests of drug users and sellers medical Marihuanas, the federal government on the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, a former drogenpolitik adviser to the Obama administration is of the view that police officers will probably not happen behind closed doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but are likely to be under the new legislation to allow legal, government regulated marijuana operations. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several towns in Colorado did not even wait for the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election day passed some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though they could open up in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, rose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will be adopted probably next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem,&quot; Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against this change. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are depending on what the community has opted for, and not afterwards, for what the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Of petrodollars ella Wyatt: I was from Oxford because I Tory am </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not only university students today are attacked for their views </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once regarded as the greatest mark in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - promoted. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival at the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke into tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said that I would have gone because I had a problem with that discover had sex in the adjoining room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A N Wilson highlighted said that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged crockery. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth, however, was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I walked away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, it was because I was suffering from systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> It is not because of my very unaccustomed name, or because I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> It was just me being harassed for a reason - a reason in this supposed cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher&apos;s and supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, according to the latest reports, a new generation of students from the moderate right under similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the younger Common Room (JRC) of the Corpus Christi College, they will be on the basis of their political views &quot;are often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They are calling for a seat on the equality committee of the College, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Making matters worse, their situation through a recent broadcast documentary on political students on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,&quot; the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It has been shown, among other graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who was in a Rolls-Royce whose and flaunted silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock. </seg>

<seg id="2428"> The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the conservative student group of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: &quot;There is a growing leftward trend in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever experienced.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is &quot;unpleasant.&quot; The 19 year old Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that she had JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to the moderate right students watched. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the wellbeing of the people,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> As an incredibly shy 18 year-old person I had arrived in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> In the last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere could even shake Stalinisten. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first few days of the first-year week, in which new students and Tutors learning, I received a foretaste of the future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the Tutors mockery of Tory students is not only tolerated, but also happily attended it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues such as the miners&apos; strike, privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa, they found their way into the holzgetäfelt rooms of the Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In my first these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English, in what was then, I had not been taken. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I stumbled on this. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face like pastry, and pretty nasty. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;If Thatcher fans learn French, or they are simply stupid?&quot; he asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other kicherten. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> In my eyes, wallten tears. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I propose that in your free time a few hours of French - that is, if you are not too preoccupied with their social activities,&quot; knurrte Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to hanging his head in my room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> On this evening, I sat in college alone at the dinner when someone slightly tippte on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is what it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, will be harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most Tory erstsemester, supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local Pub, I later tried to stand with me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I did not fully agree with Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove fruitless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the conservative Eton College, said to me: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist schweins.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How Tories have sex?&quot; asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The beat each other, or? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever be able to attend the Oxford University to lead a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> If I were like-minded only after onset of darkness? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> If I turn to the Labour Party, and my natural inclination to suppress? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years before I began my mental eye on a fege fire of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, who openly identify as Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which has had its seat in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only hated to be a Conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and had written speeches for them. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started between Oxford and the home of my parents to move and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> My father told me that I was Oxford hated, and why I did. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the vierzigers, all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> This is something they would never do, not in my home town of the träumend Tower. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends were always impeccable manners on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes are marred. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Give the whole thing a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that you are only neckt you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would like to break the heart if you gingst. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and renounce his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I secretly zerging in shame, I admitted that my parents had been subjected to &quot;brainwashing&quot; and called them &quot;old aiming.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only a short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time he wrote a week two Kolumnen in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was closed. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, to my persecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they walked away, I packte a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can look forward to a schlapp series. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But not an 18 year-old person should ever in an educational institution suffer from such intimidation and spite. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And even more tragic is that Oxford was a university, not just 14 Tory, but so far behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino has elegance of celebrity&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> At the exhibition &quot;Valentino - master of Couture,&quot; which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion maker. </seg>

<seg id="2509"> Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international Jetsets. </seg>

<seg id="2524"> The origin </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of Versessenheit, more of mutual love schafts. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He likes people with good education and the highest qualifications, and they love him. </seg>

<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift from him,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the Musae of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty,&quot; Ex-Herzogin Feira adds. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like the colors he used; they have much light and highlight the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola &apos; Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed, at long last, to have the age and the opportunity to wear a comparison of his night.... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> At the end of the 1990s, it was eventually. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red dress with flying rock and a drapierten upper part, which makes his reputation. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a real dream,&quot; says the widow of Rodrigo Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless,&quot; explains the Italian Aristokratin, between París, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Princess D&apos;Arenberg preserved their comparison of the fashion maker &quot;with absolute care,&quot; &quot;because a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Four months work and 25 &quot;Ragazze&quot; (as the fashion maker called his Näherins) were necessary to make this ivory coloured silk dress with gems, 12 different Stickereis and a four and a half metres long Schweif. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, the dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return to serve the highest society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> For years with the &quot;savoir#&quot; of the elite, Valentino is now its best copy. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, excellent with the Honour, Garavani accumulated so many honors, as any of the husbands of his serve. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;It is always his sophistication, his calm, to be nurtured and struck a perfect appearance,&quot; D &quot; Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> I gave him the last time a month ago in a gala abendessen in the Museum de Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He sat at the table of the Gräfin Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;He was impeccable; the time leaves no traces of him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> And it says a Princess... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The most difficult profession in the world: the human Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk when they are 70 kilograms of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others are working literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 workers who earn their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> To this end, he is every day down to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas from the earth ausströmend in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having a large stone extracted as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bambus körben on his shoulders on the slope of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is down to a level of 2386 metres, but the depleted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in schildkröte rates, and they retain the balance and must put their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist, a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen crashed. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which they cut down. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It is the path between the tourists, who photographed as circus apes and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company a little bit further down on a total of 1 850 metres </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, since 1960, the presence of the volcano and (rather) exploiting its workers, 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> They then sold for 10 000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in their everyday lives is widespread and the manufacture of matches, fireworks toys, cosmetics, destroy - yes, even the Bleiche of sugar is used. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we normally 70 kilograms, we get to any way around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros),&quot; said Anto, who usually makes three routes on the same day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> For each route he needed three hours, according to which he is completely at the end of the day, but then 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but is three times as much of what he would earn with the toil. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the same day, and the average monthly income two million rupees (167 million euros), is very high,&quot; explained the winner, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> He earned 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family, according to Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason, which in Indonesia is as important as the sulphur: &quot;I have married a girl from Bali, where they are, and I have brought them to Java, converting to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27-year-old Anto, for three years his life on the Kawah Ijen at risk, the sulphur in the first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work here two years, because I open a shop or wants to learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in a more than just acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This pleasant and intelligent, but the gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or working on the reception of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty wooden lodge with other agencies, and every morning at two o&apos;clock, because the sulphur also emit at night, where his distinctive yellow color bläulich shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadow challenging, it is rising in the light of a small few lamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money into the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Around 400 bodies on the krater bed baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies, which are working on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> You will not receive a share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of the natural park, along with the entrance fee in excess of 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) demanded by the tourists, the photography of the volcano and the human Tragesel. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals and not for the people,&quot; protested Madrusin, a 42 years old, the three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is in a position to 110 kilograms and assured that he continued, &quot;as long as it is,&quot; because he has the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulphur throats burn and eyes jucken when the wind suddenly and einklemmt the mine workers in the thick pillars, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases..., of course, apart from the usual breathing problems, today&apos;s pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> The basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years only in a position to carry 50 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a road between the Gebüsch camp in taman sari in 18 kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life,&quot; Unainik said, and he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> From his five children is the grandfather with his 30 years as a source. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The time passes, but poverty is generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: those who as a human cash cow at the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singapurer lay the blame for that they have no children, careers, the stress and the cost of housing and child-rearing. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore need to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we perform our civic duty and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the lyrics are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore for a viralen video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a Rapper-Songs, local slogans such as &quot;pushing a&quot; bao &quot; (loaf) in the oven, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, which revolved around the video, preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something just for the Internet, which is why we have had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst performer in the world, so we felt that it is an issue for which we have had to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried to do many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed-Dating-Abenden (fast Flirts). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> That is why we thought: why do we not do something as creative as possible, in order to tackle this problem, such as a rap on komponieren? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 million children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this issue is not easy, it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year there are 1 300 US dollars for political action in order to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government grants for couples and parents up to 15 000 Dollar per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is well known. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to its national authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the ersetzung rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why are Singapurer not more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of national authority, says that this &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled the people to marry and to form a family much more options in terms of life objectives and to set priorities,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social conditions for the higher number of people living alone, and the delay of marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic increase in the number of uphold, in order to counter the reduction of the population, with resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites where little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and do not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, an attempt has been made, the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate is the well-known impact on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example shows unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it already has an impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small Appartements, which are known as &quot;schachteln&quot; and in certain parts of the city should be built. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These Appartements have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of single people, and that they are deterred by the construction companies to build large homes for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company El Developers, says that its &quot;schachteln footwear&quot; much faster than larger residential units sell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are just days and even weeks out faster than the larger housing units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This means that our Cash Flow are much better. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if they too many small residential units within a project to build. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapurern, who work in the financial community to see that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is being delayed by many,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The children can get others. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;For me, it is important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another, roughly 20 years old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women have their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as a reason that they have no children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to having children, because the government can still do so much. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The offline private offline online is private </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary, it is the private or &quot;area of private life, where they claim to protection against any kind of interference.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for someone under 16 years old? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> What is the definition of his daily life and the social networks used? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> He does the risks to which he is exposed, if he known on the Internet, which he would not share in real life? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years old, which are often on the Net. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases associated with &quot;something very own&quot; on a personal level, &quot;the password and user&quot; when they apply it to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office,&quot; says the 10-year-old Jorge in the attempt, the meaning of &quot;private&quot; in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail - and Windows Live to explain where he has for two years on bank accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very confidential secrets, they must know what my mother, but not the whole world,&quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> At the Belgian Francs, I invite beautiful images or images of games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I am reibe I have my time with friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I would share a photograph that is not for me, or someone who makes the stupid,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene photographs from Nacktes crime to publish, or insulting or violent comments to write. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has been in Belgian Francs and nine Folger on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most people are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> These include the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I reported to me on Twitter in order to express myself and to write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I do not know if someone is saying, I invite them only high,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance or speak with friends,&quot; he states. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Although he says that he never would accept an invitation from an unknown. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Even if someone gave him a empfähle, he would ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of the 14-year-old José is in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has created Hotmail user accounts, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, 20 of the people not to know that he has attached his friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It frightens me not because we have something in common, such as music,&quot; he states. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Following the indication of the boy he has made no comments or him after his address or telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If somebody harassed or demanded of me, I simply entferne him from my account,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy experiences are not unknown, which is now known as ying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The acquaintance of a friend was taken hostage in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He did not know who it was,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> According to José, the victim, the user account was not closed. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He has just made private.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he set out a series of steps to try to secure konfigurieren a user account. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge would these young photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassment. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do so if he is unsympathetic or I want him judging one thing. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this ying is,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher for English graduate in education and learning, says that in order to guide the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information; with the appearance of these parties have changed the rules,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a Master-Titels in teaching at the Yale and author of the book &quot;Digital extra virgin and Immigrants&quot; shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digitals extra virgin they are children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we still have to learn,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand of them that they have a defined criterion about what can be published or said, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be wählerisch if they are the most important thing to be loved, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert who is the most effective way to teach the children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions, which it brings to mind. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell you that they should not do not work,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras followed a number of possibilities: there are things that you find not tell a stranger, why the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like, if you have a photograph published by you, as you have published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the rest of you publish? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The other people had asked for permission if you pictures of celebrations were labelled? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: do we all know what you are at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is for them to understand that they must act as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone is acting outside of the Internet with respect, decency and other principles, and do this same must apply to the social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If they all understand, they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age or what you share or publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, the children of the lesson &quot;thou shalt not talk to strangers&quot; will be remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Completion of the summit of the Unasur without the publication of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced previously and in theory by the seven present leaders should be signed. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe repeatedly sought access to the signed document in the sixth ordinary session of the Heads of State or Government of the Unasur, sources in the state and presidential firm initially announced that they would be handed over to the conclave, said afterwards, however, that some time would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> With questions on the text, that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was set out in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists&apos; access to information on the summit was limited at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, it was in the press room only the image of the presidential meeting without tone with the word &quot;private meeting, limited audio.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few information among the journalists, the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting of Unasur, but not from the Peruvian press officer. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document, which was widespread during the day, was the list of participating presidents, and the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which called for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> After that, the president of Peru signalled the media an Email with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but the statement made by Humala and was not on the official document on the conclusion of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite strong calls by the press the so-called Lima Declaration, which had already been announced, nor published. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA can be persuaded that the document was published Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> At two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have stressed that the information systems would be available for the journalists, but they are restricted to a large extent access to information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru, to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima to Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We are going to be the verdict on the differences which we are currently talking to the International Court of Justice, obey and execute,&quot; said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and joins the international courts,&quot; Pinera&apos;s adds clicked his heels and gave Humala with a handshakes before the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they submit to the ICJ, came after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, lodged a complaint against the agreement of Bogota had agreed to submit to the rulings of the International Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, which has been in 2011 after the ousting of President Fernando Lugo is excluded from the Unasur, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks this morning and ended the summit shortly after midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The Head of State read the final document, which it announced that 16 decisions taken and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount totaling 17 billion dollars have been set. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the decisions he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residency rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that action would be taken forward to &quot;the cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America to improve and in the event of natural disasters in order to act jointly and effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) is not a triumphant tendencies, but should serve to increase our output and to identify a better future for our peoples,&quot; Humala added. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided that a series of 31 flagship projects to give priority to the geographical links in South America, and particularly in rural and border areas will improve... and thus unite our countries and new forms of economic opportunities,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and which two should provide for a better relationship with Ecuador, even though he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America to continue an integrated region for prosperity and peace, and with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, said the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meetings that he held a meeting in Mexico with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, was expected to make the maritime conflict after a Bogota challenged the ICJ judgment to be treated respectfully. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I am tomorrow (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways - they are not mutually exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua to make talks with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega that we take this matter as civilized and respectful as possible will be dealt with,&quot; Santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention, at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, to attend. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, in the runup to the defence ministers of the bloc to adopt the action plan for the year 2013, dialogue and consensus in relation to the defence of the region is to be strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even though the latter is currently being ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn from the integration of its citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, but &quot;South America really can learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, on the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was held in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans &quot;in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing&quot; and &quot;today are practically a fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur drive. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It must be achieved on the free movement of citizens and workers in all Latin American countries, as is already in the Andean Community is the case; however, there are still reactionary sectors, which are seeking a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The president of Ecuador also supported the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA), under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and those to be taken into account, the San José Agreement signed on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The teaching, never to commit to something, and in return, we will sign the South Americans everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights based in Washington, and financed by the United States,&quot; he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not have betrayed his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that there was &quot;well-founded suspicions that Assange extradited to a third country, and his trial would not be complied with.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for it on its territory to undergo interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while &quot;the Swedish law allows this through a video conference on the Ecuador Embassy in London could be carried out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Since then he has been in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious,&quot; said the head of state of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> However, there was a danger that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space, and no physical exercises carried out in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This would affect the health of every human being,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London has been granted, the granting of a Freibriefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, this word in this case, we are not, however, there have been constant discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, balt azar Garzón, is conducting a series of procedures on various European institutions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> &quot;If the UK morning granted this licence, I believe that this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr. Assange at Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as the Swedish law allows and has been made in other cases, the problem is resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to confirm as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate, &quot;the mediocrity, bad faith and lies are denied the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense he is happy that Ecuador is no longer such journalists &quot;and not the bankers or hegemon and civic countries dominated,&quot; and, at the outset that he is in a re-election &quot;will deepen the revolution, in order to continue the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;must remain tough and no opportunism and no legal disguised coup d&apos;etat&quot; because it &quot;destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which announced the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the seerechtlichen border between the two countries, for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At present, this judgment will not be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be in the quest for a common path to be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that they can be overcome and can look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also relied on a good deal of the disputes over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America to take recourse to international bodies, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador is to achieve his third mandate in a row, he gave this possibility &quot;with much optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the belief that I was guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I could win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This is also true when we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the handling of the health problems faced by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just been with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he has told me that he is a planned, routine treatment have travelled there, and that would be expected that after the election campaign could once again travel to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It is in no way a relapse into the health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorean leader was today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The cause of death for AIDS is now too late to identify </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bombshell,&quot; he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to care for his illness alone and began to inform, and this with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV-Einheit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, which began in the 1990s was hard to imagine when many doubts, few treatments and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the time, it has avoided even the director of a clinic in IMSS, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to have this syndrome with life to survive. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused harm, and their immune system has outlived its usefulness, and are the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, &quot;the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment in good time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV-Einheit of HCG, Jaime Andrade villa nueva, and he said that this information in April this year had been supported by a respected scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade villa nueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that the greater opportunities, which are not drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above mean that anyone at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, &quot;easily can be 75 years old, as long as he is under control,&quot; the expert said. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans now average 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from 6 678 cases in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), but it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients have died in the national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and until May of this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why, then, are still dying? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the drugs, but the problem is that the people in advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a powerful statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, timely manner diagnoses are needed, and that is why all people, where it is needed, massive screening tests should be offered.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal will agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio to conduct its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>

<seg id="2814"> Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, there are big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In certain places &quot;has actually increased the distribution of condoms; they were previously issued, they now give us packages with one hundred piece, which is a good thing, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need?&quot; is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and on the health care system, the young people do not want to suspend, assured the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but spending in public toilets, which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not for the promiscuity to be promoted. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether condoms will be distributed under his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality is not enough; it is the best condoms to bring those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he has brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key details of Jalisco </seg>

<seg id="2828"> After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling that the restructuring of the debt of the group does not recognize Vitro, which has been reached on a trade konkurs in Mexico, is a sinister precedent for any national companies with operations in neighbouring countries, the payment problem. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction with international agreements have no validity. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice on 15 June recognition of the ruling by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river well done. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico the floodgates of three inconsistencies in the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> While the judge in the case indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law must be subject to the United States, says the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the commercial konkurs are treated in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with national cross profile is not known. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, to this end, the model law of the United Nations created for the unification of international trade law, although the American Law Institute has been used as an arbiter. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment certain that without the votes of the societies for recognition of the liabilities of the estate, which the branches of Vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who are charged in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergència, Elliot nacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This will not be taken into account by the Appeal Court. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country beatings. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For this reason the family González Sada before the same conflict with an appeals court, so that the vote in plenary session will take place, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them were voting on. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> If this is not granted, the Cerciorare-Einspruch, which calls for a review of the procedure by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious in this case is that the court had a document from the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) has been sent out, what the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and what will be pointed out that we stick to the agreements signed by both countries, with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> It also pointed out that the country the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes, who was the composite sport for more than 60 years and has visited the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before a stroke in 2008 he was tied to the bench, Rexes was 6 years part of this sport, whether as players lower classes, players in the first National League, agent and head of BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;My whole life I have put many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I am president of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s was&quot; remembered Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is exaggerating with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they testify. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotional memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or manager of the club celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros of eight championships since 1967 as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There have been many years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then passed me with a schaft in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then took over, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, &quot; Reyes says. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I know that I am gene Bartow, who is here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a very strong and 2 m great players. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You Möchtest him? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow recommended after the free junk surgeon Raymond Gausse, who could creep and was one of our best Werfer. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember how he said that if Mincy schaft had made it possible for Bayamon, Gausse for another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The schaft of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he had already stood at the top of the association. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time he preferred his executions and to enjoy Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we, for the first time in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico won against the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we showed the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last Spielzug for the second time repeated, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as those in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream team won. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> My favorite is the team for the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won, and the team of the United States offered a struggle, as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> When the team was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury could not be in the process. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> One team, perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, with which we won a gold medal, and we were very pleased, was that of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito,&quot; Pablo Alicea, and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the banned players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every prediction won the gold medal. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> There was no doubt that Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His figures at the international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level, such as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Among the boys I liked the work of Leo Arill well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you glaubst is the best, what you have achieved in the association? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you still have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I could have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The fact that the boys in Ponce, for example, are only in their area and only in the national Playoffs teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, offizielle and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> This is something I am proud. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you make today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, see videos of music from my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a basketball game. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side. </seg>
