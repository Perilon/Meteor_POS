<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justified their policy by the need for fighting against the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Center Brennan regards the latter as a myth, affirming that the electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Moreover, the republican lawyers listed only 300 cases of fraud electoral in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A thing is certain: these new provisions will influence rate of participation negatively. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this direction, these measurements will undermine the American democratic system partly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments promulgated starting from 2009 new laws making more difficult the process of registration or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon gained in importance after the elections of November 2010 which transfer to be added 675 new republican representatives in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, 180 government bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that the voters present an identity card with photograph and a proof of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce also the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to be registered like voter the day of the poll and withdraw with the citizens having a legal file their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no American State required voters to present an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first State to establish such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice in other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During two last years, they sponsored government bills in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens do not have universal identity card like the chart of the health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American citizens, are 21 million people in age to vote, do not have identity cards with photograph emitted by a governmental agency of their State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such identification papers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it costs some often more than one hundred dollars to obtain the necessary identity card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions assign in a disproportionate way the young people, the minorities, and the people with low-income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people gaining less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the necessary identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, of the voters considered as voter more for the democratic candidates, are not authorized in several States to use their identity card with photograph emitted by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same States authorize the members of the clubs of peaches or hunting which vote more on the republican side to use to vote the cards emitted by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to present such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen States adopted laws requiring of the voters to prove that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measurements clearly aim at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it Appert whom two Hispanic voters out of three support the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, the republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of the voters the day of the poll in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, they limited the right of people and groups to provide an assistance to the voters wishing to be registered. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, at the time of the general election of 2004, the registration campaigns of the voters contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 made fall of 17% the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Moreover, the republican legislators adopted laws in five other States aiming at reducing the period of advance voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, at the time of the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the voters who have advance voting were Afro-Americans, whereas the latter accounted for only 13% of the voters of the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applied with the Hispanic ones. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Those accounted for only 11% from the voters, but 24% citizens who voted by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the other hand, the white which formed 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters voter by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the adoption of laws vigorously restricting the registration of the voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several government bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The prosecuting attorney of the United States intervened to suspend the most discussed laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They could limit the damage partly. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 States adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules installation unquestionably will make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the character in favour of the laws which were voted and they see an obvious objective there to influence the results in 2012 in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Center Brennan of 2011 shows that the States which adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes necessary to the electoral college to gain the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to affirm with certainty that these legislative modifications on the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But a thing is certain: these new provisions will influence rate of participation negatively. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this direction, these measurements will undermine the American democratic system partly. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Tracking of the cancer of the prostate: to pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the test of STEP would have sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or of false-positives, which involve useless medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What to make hesitate even more the already reticent men to pass from the screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked for the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted to the United States, there was much contamination between the reference groups, it is thus difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, that one European, concluded with a difference in mortality between the patients who had a tracking and those which did not have of it. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, which one has between 30 and 40% of more than chances to have metastases if one is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I thus recommend the test as from 50 years, or 40 years if one has a direct relative who already had a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of origin Afro-American are also more at the risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to once make the good decision one detected a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others which are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is really necessary to render comprehensible with the patient the degree of risk of its cancer, by offering the possible options to him, by not treating necessarily cancers of the prostate which do not carry not reached to the long-term life, and while choosing rather, in these cases, for an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, much of men at whom one detects a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One will suggest to them making active monitoring and if the disease progresses, one will offer a treatment to them. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more, one determines with precision of the criteria to decide which would have or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I thus recommend nevertheless to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with its doctor to determine if one should pass it or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the international Company of urology, Movember created a tool which makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the test of STEP. </seg>
<seg id="72"> One can download this document (in English for the moment, a translation will be offered soon) at this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> There does not exist unfortunately miraculous formula to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> In spite of progress of research, the adoption of good practices of life remains the best means of reducing the risks to suffer from it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, one could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> “So nobody any more smoked, this rate would climb to at least 50%”, underlines André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Company of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, one evaluates that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain also completely unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Company of cancer, the fight against the tobacco addiction remains a priority, in spite of the reduction amongst smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The cigarette is related to 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It constitutes also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> That harms the health of people enormously. </seg>
<seg id="84"> “Still today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec”, the spokesperson André Beaulieu regrets. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk to die of a cancer falls of half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The plumpness and obesity support also the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would increase the risks of cancer of the centre, the colon and the rectum, the oesophagus, the pancreas and the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> “Research shows that the regular practice of the physical-activity during a whole life protects from cancer from the colon”, one adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too great quantity, it makes climb the risks to be reached of a cancer colorectal. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Pork-butcheries also, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by manuring, drying or salting can involve the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> “These last can damage the cells of the organization and lead to the development of cancer”, one explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> During last years, several scientists studied the bonds between the vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research is not however conclusive for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Whereas one of them noted a reduction in the risks of cancer of the prostate, another an increase noted rather. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of the vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of speaking about his concerns and his family antecedents with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> “To pass a screening test, that does not give cancer.” </seg>
<seg id="104"> The boson of peeled Higgs </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of boson of Higgs created a whole agitation, last summer, and due. </seg>
<seg id="106"> That this boson takes part in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the Universe, only that is indeed believed. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard Model - our the best, or “less worse” explanation of nature and the behavior the matter - but which was not observed yet empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is indeed Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> One knows without the shade of a doubt that one holds an authentic news particle, and that it resembles much boson of Higgs predicted by the standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, of new revealed data this week at the time of a great congress of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm it, but it still misses data to be perfectly certain about it. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Let us suppose all the same that it is indeed Higgs, since the chances to be mistaken seem mean, and see what it acts. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this low world, a law fatally impossible to circumvent wanting that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Not average to infringe this rule - and, you do not test too extremely will hurt yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> However even if the physics of the particles is a quite strange world, it proves that it has also a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, who stipulates that two particles cannot occupy same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state” - this “state” consisting roughly speaking of some their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, one finds good citizens named fermions, which obey the principle of Pauli wisely. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other are agitated the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who do not admire nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons are divided then into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and “particles of force”, by which the great forces of the nature are propagated and to which the boson of Higgs would be to some extent related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it should it be underlined here, are not all of the small beasts as exotic as one could believe it. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the “particle of light” which is the “messenger” of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, indeed, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, that “disturbs” the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a stone launched in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This “disturbance” is born an electromagnetic wave (from the light, or infra-red, or of the ultra-violet, etc), and this wave is anything else only one photon - and thus, one of bosons “carrying force”. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies with boson of Higgs, with this difference close it is another field, the field of Higgs, who must be “disturbed” so that this boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were about a cold pond whose only very large rock could wrinkle surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is why one needs an immense particle accelerator as that of the CERN - the Broad Collider High-energy particle is a ring of 27 km circumference! - to reach such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> They are indeed not all the particles, nor all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like the magnets, do it, but others not - a bit of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, in fact the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those which do it have a mass, whereas the others (like the photon, hold) do not have any. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what “can bring” all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, that is used to check the validity of the standard Model (ms), and that also makes it possible to the physicists to scan any difference between the observations and the predictions of the ms. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are besides several to ardently wish that one find some, because the least difference could open a door on a “new physics” and stop certain holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This one, it should be said, still has enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter of the Universe (Re-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But one did not find such variations to the CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> The repercussions of this research in the daily newspaper of Mister and Mrs All-the-World, they, are more difficult to predict, but one would be wrong to suppose that there will not be. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Hold: with the whole beginning of the Sixties, the pionniers of the laser, in the Laboratories Beautiful, by no means suspected the revolution which their work was going to start. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw of it scientific applications, but anything moreover. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already said us to fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed itself the first continuous laser (the first were pulsated), in 1962 -, at the beginning the laser was rather seen like a “gadget of laboratory”. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine… </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation which surrounds research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small sensor of light in 1969, during his work in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, serves now as “eye” with all the digital cameras of the world, and the Nobel of physique 2009 was worth to him. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That does not want of course to say that the activities of the LHC necessarily will transform our lives, but that means that, really, one never knows… </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way of dying… | The Duty </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed delicate question of the end of the lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must begin again soon whereas a government bill prepares. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this essential field, much remains to be made. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Duty tried to look at there more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago hardly, Mr L. lived still alone in its apartment of Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The cancer of the prostate which corroded it had left him a two years respite. </seg>
<seg id="153"> “They had given me five years to be lived, I made seven years”, he says, mid--fig mid--grape, lengthened in his bed at the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where it arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> “But it is always a shock, one cannot be prepared with that”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease makes its work: a weakness enormous which it prevented only going to the toilets, and even from only eating. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat at table in front of an appetizing lunch, it agrees to be let help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, it arrives even at smiling, speaks with the unknown ones which was affairent around him, bring its drugs to him, offer a bath to him. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> “My greater wish, it is that me am cured diarrhoea, it is humiliating”, he entrusts. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, L &quot; equips found a remedy for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> “During our life, one learns that a man, that pisses upright”, Pierre Brodeur tells, psychologist at the house Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress at the stage of the child, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> “That depends on the capacity of the person” to accept the regression, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, of the opinion of several people working in palliative care, of great moments are held in the middle same of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who enter to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have three months a maximum forecast of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, L &quot; equips doctors and nurses who surrounds them does not lavish any more a care known as “curative”. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs. the A., 89 years, worst feared is to die “conscious and choked”. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> “I have good children”, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> “I do not have any more wishes in the life”, she says, before accepting that one poses a mask to him to help it to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It expects all the same, in the next days, a last visit of her son from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois, one lavishes, with a group of voluntary, the care of the body and the assistance with the food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are the palliative care, that one gives when there is no more anything else to make. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, one counts a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when it is known that one ends all up dying one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, the life continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> That it is on the level of physical comfort, emotive or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> With dying, one will agree to lavish care of mouth to the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabétiques ones will not be held any more to control their sugar rate. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of the daily newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, one was used a beer for Mr. X, deceased during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it is his/her son who will finish beer with the feet of the late one. </seg>
<seg id="185"> “One helps the close relations as much as the patients”, Nathalie Savard, director of the care tells. </seg>
<seg id="186"> To the house Victor-Gadbois, the days are followed but do not resemble. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In the sides of old a 93 year old man who enjoys his last assembly of family in the court, fixed well in his pillows while one clinks glasses in his honor, a 36 year old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having very tried to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> “For six months, there has been always from three to five beds which are occupied by old cancer patients of less than 45 years”, Dre Christiane Martel worries. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients who are allowed at the house Victor-Gadbois arrive of their residence, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to the palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> One says that 77% of the Canadians do not have quite simply access to palliative care, i.e. to care conceived to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrived at the final phase of his life, that it is in residence, the hospital or in house of care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, like the house Victor-Gadbois and the Company of palliative care in residence of Large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to the cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in the Québécois health care which makes fear with several doctors specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law framing the euthanasia and the assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto, signed celebrities of the palliative care whose Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulate to testify to their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dre Christiane Martel, the Québécois health care system is not enough powerful to ensure that each one will be entitled to palliative care of quality before one agrees to proceed to the euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient spending 14 days to the urgency, in great pains, without one doing what is necessary to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients ask to die only because they receive the adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And in parallel, several oncologists bait themselves on their patients until the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already tiny when it gave up a testing chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I stop beating me, she told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that J &quot; stays finished! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Pas des care the Almightyes </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dre Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank looking after them not to have reached their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it should well be said that the palliative care is not absolutely the Almightyes in the treatment of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care at the Company of palliative care in residence of Large Montreal, the patients would be refractory with the treatments against the pain in 8% of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the any end of the lifetime, the doctors then resort often to the palliative sedation, which amounts deadening the patient until the moment of his death, either in a sporadic way, or in a permanent way. </seg>
<seg id="207"> One cannot make pretence any more not hear this part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more, the patient not relieved will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die. ” </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not want to necessarily say “I want that you put down me”, that wants to say “I want to be relieved”. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report was made possible thanks to a purse of journalism of the Research institutes in health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real scandals of great width in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Civils servant of the roadway system, entrepreneurs of the BTP, raisers funds of political parties and specialists in the Mafia Italian tell day after day what they know of formidable “a system”, mixing building industry, civils servant, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A “industry” which cost very expensive the Québécois taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> “They is curious as the system is exhausted since one took the great ways”, is ironical Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former chief of police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is by him that the scandal is burst in 2011, by the means of a basic investigation into the embezzlements related to the road work contracts in Quebec, to which the first liberal minister for the time, Jean Charest, had not authorized that with move back. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The “Duchesneau report” drew up a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of a public official. </seg>
<seg id="218"> “Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he underlines, the only ministry for transport would have saved a billion dollar on the contracts”, some holding back their instincts to touch a quota! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission “already made fall two mayors”, he adds, by hoping that she manages “to show the stratagems behind the individuals”. </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent unit anti-corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent Unit anti-corruption, created in 2011, is also harnessed there with its army of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> More the police officers of “the squad Hammer” who, since 2009, would have led the “cartel of the sewers” of Montreal to put the soft pedal on swellings of contracts… </seg>
<seg id="223"> These last weeks, it proceeded to searches in series and carried charges for fraud and corruption against elected local officials, like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned of his post of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected of having pocketed of the bribes with repetition in return for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Are formally in addition marked of the engineers to the roadway system of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, of which Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> This last created sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Itself poured during years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal with an intermediary related to the Mafia which transferred the money with Montreal Union, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. Zambito sowed with all winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially with the liberals then with the power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also acknowledged to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-vice-first minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Contracts of sewers of which it inflated the costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the “system” of corruption functioned roundly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer in public works, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, it received building firms gifts, invitations with travel, tournaments of golf, restaurants, matches of hockey and bribes adding up 736,000 dollars, in return for contracts of sewers of which it inflated the costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other civils servant of the roadway system acknowledged to be themselves made lubricate the leg by inflating from 30% to 40% the invoices, by forgery will extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, showed Mr. Tremblay to have deliberately closed the eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cases with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected of Montreal to draw the alarm bell. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the district of River-of-Meadows, east of the island, it rises by 2010 against the sale of a municipal ground bought 5 million dollars and resold… 1.6 million with promoters, in full real boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> dirty money 70% in the electoral campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> Investigation which will be finally installation, it says that it “draws on a wire making it possible to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop causes to become gangrenous it and to pin the faulty ones”. </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is “painful but positive”. </seg>
<seg id="242"> One is cleaning the wound but one would need a survey unit specific to Montreal and a day before, not to see returning the doubtful practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Like one does the housework. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that “civils servant flew of the hundreds of million dollars”, but worries especially about the role of “elected officials to the current of the stratagem”, when they did not soak in the chicanery! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating at 70% the dirty money share in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he is ironical: “It was told me that it was only one pale reflection of reality.” </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Québécois government proposes to limit to 100 dollars the gifts with the parties but that will not change gives it, according to him: “As long as the electoral expenditure strictly will not be limited, there will be dirty money in policy.” </seg>
<seg id="248"> He preach a complete revision of the system of granting of public contracts and party financing: “One cannot go low; to go at the bottom as of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on more solid bases, with more controls and of laws.” </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those which laugh at it to look in their own court… </seg>
<seg id="250"> “the PSG is not the FC Barcelona!” </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you took a new scale with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progression? </seg>
<seg id="253"> One can explain it by an individual awakening but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Large players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Each day, I progress to their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff brought me also much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> With the daily newspaper, these elements push me to hoist my level of game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> All goes very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not ignite. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Of my beginnings to the center of preformation of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stages. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You thus benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti… </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits of this summer are accustomed to dispute matches of high level very. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> With the result that a player as me desire has for coping and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings to me much as for my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played same station as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Is Ancelotti the right man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires the respect in all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, it does not have the equal one Leagues of them 1 and belonged to the best European trainers. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has great experience and gained many titles with crested clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> It mixed with large players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that it will gain other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had had a discussion comforting with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I left a series of wounds then. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Confidence that it grants to me explains also my performances. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Which glance do you relate to the first part of season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyon took the place of leader to us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major targets is the League of the champions: we qualified ourselves for the 8es of finale with the manner. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Which is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> One will try to go possible further. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, all can arrive. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But there will be our word to say vis-a-vis very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want initially to finish first of our hen, in front of Oporto, to be able to receive at the time of 8th from finale return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG become a large European club in the short run? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It has of it already the budget… </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a large European club, Paris needs to gain titles and to fall under the duration. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG gives itself means so that this project is concretized. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In would League 1, not to gain the title, like last season, be a large failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, that would represent a large disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, one has really in heart to pocket this championship. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, one did not pass far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because there were qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> One made a very large season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> One finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed being champion… </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, carried out one season even more fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think that it is the good one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the large teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux are with the fight for the title, I think that one has the weapons to carry it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you estimate that the media expect too much the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that many us are expected within sight of what were invested and of the players that one A. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It completely is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Afterwards, when one gains 4-0 in residence against Troyes and that one still finds things to be reproached to us, it is sure that it is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people await from more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> One will be able to never gain 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> One is not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> One tries to set up a project of game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds itself with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> One proved in League champions that one could answer present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Have looked at Manchester City which does not arrive, for two seasons, to qualify itself for the 8es of finale, they also made enormous expenditure! </seg>
<seg id="314"> With the glance as of invested sums, one imagined you with 15 points in advance with the truce! </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseilles, which were not well last season, “were boosted” by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> That shows that League 1 is enthralling. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite everything the difficulties, one ended up carrying it. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems completely depend on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> As well better as one says as there is a “Zlatan dependence”. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That wants to say that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that it puts many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It came for that and it proves that he is the star of League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> It showed everywhere where it passed that he was a large player, a star world. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, one respects the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Also respects the men whom it has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What it has fact is really exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> That pushes the others to hoist their level of game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> Like a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had in heart to take part in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my wound prevented me grappiller of the time of game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things over there and I left there reinforced. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I manage to carry out good matches in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I hoped for since my baptism with the Blue ones. </seg>
<seg id="336"> One learned the lessons from what occurred to Ukraine and one must have an exemplary behavior today. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Which glance do you relate to the first months of Didier Deschamps in charge of the Blue ones? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> One is well placed in the qualifier group for the World one. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The sport selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires gains it. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was to it Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue ones to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Does the null good (1-1) snatch, on October 16th, in Spain constitute a match founder? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each one fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived on similar match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, to pay and sell without the banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> All the opposite of the current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and expenses of treatment enters the recipients. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, like often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made banking monopolies, led to the financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros…) and a protocol of exchange made safe in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the file-swapping of par par. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Approximately 200,000 transactions were already recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A small thousand of Web sites accept the bitcoins like gifts or means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course of the bitcoin, after having reached a top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell with 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to world exchanges in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central bank (ECB) was interested there in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes bitcoin like “the currency virtual having the most success”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency like the “appropriations”, used to progress in a video game which one gains while playing or which one can buy (and sometimes to exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The Facebook social network also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But, each time, a central authority controls and treats the exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are at the same time agents of the book of accounts, inspectors, transmitters of currency, and purchasers and salesmen. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network function? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of related information with this transaction is signed electronically by a system of coding to double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can thus check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is as possible to make sure as the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public book of accounts, diffused in all the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The stage-key consists in writing this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers, and whose winner, left provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about a phase of chopping of file, i.e. of transformation of a large file into a shorter and single digital print. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers “take” the new transaction and add to him a number before “chopping” the unit. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal being to find the number which gives a particular print (many of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this found number, the other nodes check easily that it is the good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement related to the chain of the whole of the other transactions; any modification would change the print. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different prints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer having solved the challenge gains 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the hundred millionth, which leaves margin… </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase of the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already had tops and bottoms. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Providing Web sites of the services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins in stolen deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> “The fault used does not relate to the protocol itself”, Pierre Noizat ensures, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in true currency using the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB mentions also possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Serious actors as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the platform of blogs WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, “giant balances” were launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> “Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged”, is delighted Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, are equivalent to a credit card (in true currency) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which cost thus less. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier manages moreover its identity and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough for them to communicate an address which a telephone can “photograph and recognize”, Pierre Noizat specifies, who ensures to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of reconsideration of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> “It will be necessary time so that Bitcoin is essential, but 2013 could be revolving”, he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Besides The ECB, in his report, envisages to revalue the various risks, now considered as raised, in the event of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And afterwards? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army takes again possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without all to expect us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> They are especially the Afghan peasants whom we punished by regarding them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the casualties, mutilated. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The talibans are composed foreign extremists, former chiefs taken refuge in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, like time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, old and antiquated, even if they were joined by Jihadists, Pakistani, Arabic, Uzbeks, inhabitants of Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurrectionists, those will not be it any more when the Westerners are done more discrete. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of planted hills of almond trees thanks to French appropriations, was done in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and armoured tanks joined Kabul without being attacked, flown over by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no beachcomber of the talibans on Kabul as of the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances changed since their irresistible projection of 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the fights between various factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had then been perceived like a kind of release, a return to the security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan ones paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujaheddin, Afghan government and current talibans meet in the desire to keep the women in a lower position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The principal notable ones of the anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They were moulted as racketeers, being seized of governmental grounds to resell them in building plots with the returned refugees of Iran and Pakistan, profiting D &quot; enormous contracts American from subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They were discredited; most between them themselves did not fight besides. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government which is not made up robbers. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as those which will leave knew to benefit from American generosities: the capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired war and of its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They mixed with the modern world at the time of their exiles in Iran or in Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages of them. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Approximately 65% of the population have less than 25 years; Kabul counts 5 million inhabitants now, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the governmental schools are full, girls like boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will be necessary to provide work to these young people who will not want to turn over any more to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opponents, are fond of delicacies mobile phones; television, and its serials Turkish which present a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will the authorities which will order it be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already worried to reconstitute provincial militia, which will escape the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, country of mountains, with the strong local identities, should be able to profit from a certain decentralisation, with the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized State, with presidential power extremely, removing the post of Prime Minister who existed since the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzaï does not want controls foreign, in particular at the time of the elections envisaged in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But its country is, since the Fifties and already quite front, depend on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry was re-starting, no stopping is not in state, no system important of irrigation is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> All is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left on the initiative private. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental control on the infrastructures would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealths. </seg>
<seg id="439"> That did nothing but add to the feeling which Westerners N &quot; were there that to seize some. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat the copper or iron ore on the spot, nor of means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, letting the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will be necessary a day well also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which largely imports and exports depend, restore normal reports. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of the fighting troops French was completed on November 20th. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new treaty of co-operation envisages the continuation of the traditional assistances: high school of girls, boys, department of French at the university, Institute French, co-operation in the military fields, legal, medical and agricultural, support for the archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try “to gain the hearts and the spirits” and to carry out the task impossible to make coincide offensive assistances and actions, a service D &quot;&quot; actions civilo-soldiers” of the ministry for Defense (Cimic), removed in 2012, carried out, and makes conclude by small an ONG Frenchwoman, many work of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of villages of mountain. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, greedy in hand-D &quot; works local, could help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, well, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the grounds and increase in cultivable surfaces. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What will we leave like remembering, after two billion military euros of expenditure? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A budget much more modest would contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy received tens of written requests for small agricultural achievements emanating from local communities of the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> So that they are released from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, which the farmers told me to wish, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small civil help, controlled well and which touches them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution with the forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new gamble of president Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Whereas Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants temporarily the absolute powers to him, it decided to play its go-all. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Taking everyone of short, he announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote for her final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted two months additional to this Parliament to finish her work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Here are soon two years that Egypt is pressed on a provisional text, several times amended what weakens stability institutional and led to legal imbroglios. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative did nothing but increase the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the President perseveres in its “is delirious autocratic”, continuing “to betray his word” and “to trample the right”. </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his partisans, one ensures that it is a means of finishing some as fast as possible with the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be organized in the fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy whereas the dispute made fumes in all the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as it affirmed in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The more so as this recourse to a precipitated vote is due of the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I keep the absolute powers”, those having supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with great islamist majority, voted for the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals missed with the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Mid-November, little before the constitutional declaration, they had flapped the door, estimating not to have been able to put forward their sights. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights, the religious minorities or the civil society had made some in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the quorum necessary is reached, 11 people, of the members substitutes, were added to haste, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim brothers. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Without surprise, it is generally unanimously that the articles were voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators had fun besides owing to the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around… the hour of the prayer, certain members of the committee estimating that it clock of constituent was badly regulated. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still in the train D &quot; being voted yesterday evening, comprises 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of all the attentions, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that “the principles of the charia are the primary source of the right.” </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Salafist parties, for which L &quot; establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace “the principles” by “the rules”, which would have allowed a more strict application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the islamist ones, the fact that this article was not modified is a pledge of their good will and their respect of the other components of the Egyptian company. </seg>
<seg id="477"> “Hypocrisy”, the liberals answer, who see only one blow of communication there. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They aim in particular article 220, which confers on the Al-Azhar university an advisory role, in particular as regards checking the conformity of the laws with the charia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because “people called has to decide are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> One can see the first steps of a theocracy there”. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Fears of the liberals moreover are poked by the fact that the next vice-chancellor of this university should be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> “For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, one remains within the framework of the Civil status. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most lawyers who worked on this text are not oulémas but academics, for some trained in the French system” Alexis Blouet moderates, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he recognizes “that there can be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed borrow from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> One refers to the “fiqh there” in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, note]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question could in the future arise to know up to what point of the civil judges are qualified to decide above”. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because as of wide powers which it grants to the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim brothers make the point that those are clearly reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another litigious point: powers conferred on the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wish of the soldiers, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but at a National council of defense. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Not more than the lawsuits of civilians in military tribunals will not be prohibited, as defense associations of the human rights required it. </seg>
<seg id="494"> These last inform also of their concerns concerning the text, which they judge liberticide. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The offence of blasphemy is maintained and it insult from now on is prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, of the press in particular. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Moreover, no article echoes more protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word did not appear in the preceding one Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Whereas the Egyptian president was to express himself yesterday evening on television, of the demonstrations are envisaged this afternoon. </seg>

<seg id="586"> “Which language has, to Moscow goes”: the migrants save money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> Whereas the deputies and the militants of the human rights polemize on what the relative law will give to the obligatory linguistic test, of the defrauders selling of “false” certificates already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant worker comes to Moscow, Saint-Pétersbourg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are natives of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal: to earn money to help their stayed at home families. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since December 1st, a law is coming into effect and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule relates to only those which intend to work in the sector of the services, housing, the services to the individuals and the retail selling. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, promises the federal migratory Service, the tests will become obligatory for all the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Moreover, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the bases of right. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It will be necessary to validate its Russian knowledge of languages to obtain and renew his work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Only the nationals of the countries are free where Russian has the statute of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The people having obtained certificates or diplomas of teaching before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not concerned either with this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Benefit, negative attitude and protection of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of the centers of examination will be under the aegis of the Russian Institute of language Pouchkine, the University of the friendship of the people, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State de Saint-Pétersbourg and other establishments of higher education of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The immigrants will be able to pass the examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers were already open on all the territory. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the Duma of State and the Federal service of the migrations. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law between into force, the defenders of the human rights already to many recoveries asked the question in the press: what will that give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and the immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, the representatives of the migratory service, that answer will allow to reduce the number of people suffering “from the slave system to work”. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak about defense rights of migrant worker, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal service of the migrations in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of the rights must start before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organized selection will make it possible to solve 90% the problems of the foreign blue-collar workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for the migrants without profession, without formation, those which do not know the language and which do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the comprehension of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross people dishonest persons who, under pretext to help it of, will provide him a “travel” in an over-populated maisonnette where him and tens of its similar will be tormented during months without food and paper and will have to slave away between 12 and 14 hours per day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints on behalf of our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> “On their premises, a thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are misled, their passport is taken, and they do not touch the wages envisaged”, confirms the Chief of the Management of the services of migration for the work of the migratory service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Do not dispute me, Mister the police officer! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, of many nationals of the Republics of Central Asia which wishes to come to gain money in Russia entrust that they not know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> It is of course not their fault, but well their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Inhabitants of Tajik can be allowed to follow would be this only one passable primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not have even what to nourish their children without speaking of equipping them correctly and to equip them for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they arrive at adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when the language is not known, they entrust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> “You feel decreased and reduced”. </seg>
<seg id="619"> The defenders of the Human rights notice however an important aspect of the relative law to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The examinations will be intended only to the migrants who have a legal statute. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without statute, there will be no examination nor of official work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> However, most migrant worker continue to live in Russia in an illegal way. </seg>
<seg id="623"> “Welcome or defense to enter” </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain why it is not so easy to obtain an official statute in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, one can quickly obtain a false recording for only 1,500 roubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we do not have a recording, from where the cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> “They ask us 100.200 roubles, of what to buy cigarettes, tea”, entrusted to the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, native of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> “Make quickly, stinginess not and buys a beautiful work of art” </seg>
<seg id="631"> As of the first day of the coming into effect of the relative law to the language, one discovered that papers of recording of the migrants were not the only ones with being false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of examinations of languages were already confiscated by the employees of the federal service of the migrations. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Falsified papers leave an ordinary color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners had them for nothing: each migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to spend seven thousand roubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is twice and half expensive than the official procedure: this one will cost migrant worker three thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of the power and the defenders of the Human rights agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these “bits of paper”. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give to migrant worker who could not validate the examination of the first blow time to follow language classes. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Moreover, the immigrants who do not know Russian will see proposed a work in fields which do not imply to communicate actively with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry for the Interior does not deal with the market of the weapons </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of the crimes implying of the legal weapons is very weak </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harden the law in the opposition as of carriers to civil weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such is the reaction of the authorities vis-a-vis recent incidents: that it is the shootings carried out at the time of the marriages or the slaughter organized by the Muscovite lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who caused seven deaths. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to prohibit the port of the weapons with rubber balls in the public places and to record the lawful age of obtaining the gun licence by making it pass from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the chief of the committee of the Duma for the security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments with the law on the weapons would be introduced at the Duma of State soon. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities try to solve the problem in “tightening the screw”. </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, of the representatives of various centers of shootings, require to give up “this foolish hardening”. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is tiny, declared with the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and specialist in the crime for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Ministry for the Interior, over one six months period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are certain that the reinforcement of the laws concerning the civil weapons will not prevent the criminals from being supplied at the black-market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, one can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry for the Interior affirms that it controls the diffusion of the illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: factory with the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black-market of the weapons is provided via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The principal channels are five, tells Victor Baranets, colonel with the retirement having been used ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General headquarter. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Capture screen drawn from a site taking of the orders of weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is “the military trace”, i.e. the weapons which were flights during military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> “These weapons were flights by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians”, explains Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons resulting from the black-market are those concealed by the criminals with the police. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains why it is as well the weapons flights in stocks of the police as those catch directly with the representatives of the police. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal guns leave on sale since the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of the latter often underwent explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> “Attested versions indicate that certain fires were started intentionally to dissimulate the deficit”, explains the former serviceman. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, the gunmakers are there for something. </seg>
<seg id="664"> “One sees factories of private weapons which do not compete with competition on the international market and run out the weapons on the black-market, in particular in Moscow”, tells an expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black-market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A significant portion of guns and machine-guns come from the poor countries, like Kirghizie. </seg>
<seg id="667"> “One finds there a local production, sometimes artisanal, a Mafia created and organizes the supply”, the former serviceman adds. </seg>
<seg id="668"> From which do the weapons come? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of the illegal weapons on the black-market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the question was made up in 2011 by the Center of analysis of the problems and study for the public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry for the Interior and Rosstat, the files criminal and the public data of the portals relating to the weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The great majority of the illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and the police. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons present on the black-market managed “by fault of the employees whose work is related to the weapons”, one explains in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the military places of conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% result from “clandestine excavations”. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A salesman and consultant of an arms manufacture having requested to keep anonymity ensure that since long time nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine excavation; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Generally, according to him, the salesmen will seek the new goods in the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys via an ensign a unit, for example a gun All. </seg>
<seg id="678"> One delivers it to him while passing the goods by a netting. </seg>
<seg id="679"> “It transports it downtown and resells it for 900 € by the unit with two chargers”, he tells. </seg>
<seg id="680"> “It is true that the police is with the current of all the business, thus, when crimes are about to be elucidated, it carries out a purchase of control near the merchants of illegal weapons”, the salesman adds. </seg>
<seg id="681"> “As in a shop of luxury” </seg>
<seg id="682"> The salesman and the purchaser are generally by the means of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I consulted sites, blogs, until a type appears and proposes to me to come to the station from Begovaya where somebody became to take me along in a “corner” to haggle over. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, one gave it on the spot to me </seg>
<seg id="685"> Victor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, it is necessary that I know somebody who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know somebody, but I do not trust him. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are salesmen on the markets, but over there it is necessary to also come while saying for example “On behalf of such person, who asked me to transmit that his/her daughter lost a tooth”. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy even a pair of American fists using a person whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> It delivers them to me only with me because it knows that I will not give it. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The small new ones seek weapons in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former serviceman Victor Baranets tested himself as a purchaser of illegal weapons in the middle of the years 1990 when it prepared to publish an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The diagrams, according to him, did not change. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Him a photo album was given in which there was “all that one wants”. </seg>
<seg id="694"> “I believed myself in a shop of luxury”, remembers the soldier. </seg>
<seg id="695"> It there does not have a secrecy for the purchaser, explains Baranets, one can all test. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As potential customers, I am not satisfied to buy, one goes with the salesman in forest and one installs a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> “One lets me draw and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, one starts to negotiate”, the expert describes. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A shop since its settee </seg>
<seg id="699"> The search engines display the sites and the groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons “for various uses”. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For that, one needs any document and nobody to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> “It is enough to have an amount of money specifies”, one writes in publicity on the site “To buy a gun or a machine-gun of combat”. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The users there leave their request and put their questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And does one sell to the minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> “Without licence, of course”, asks the user “Ivan” (preserved orthography). </seg>
<seg id="705"> “All Buys. Moscow”, written “Fedorenkov” in its very direct request. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal security service diffused an immense network of false sites and collects with the shovel the people eager to buy combat weapons. </seg>
<seg id="707"> People ruent themselves on food like famished wolves and then they are found to exploit coal in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> Victor Baranets, observer and former serviceman </seg>
<seg id="709"> I heard of this kind of diagrams: generally, the site is recorded out of field of application of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The purchaser carries out the payment on the automatic terminals. </seg>
<seg id="712"> “It receives in return a photograph and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden”, explains Right secretary of association the “to a weapon”, Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets affirms that by making a request on the site, one can find oneself without weapon and behind the bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal security service diffused an immense network of false sites and collects with the shovel the people eager to buy combat weapons. </seg>
<seg id="715"> “People ruent themselves on food like famished wolves and then they are found to exploit coal in Siberia”, - affirms it. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimate the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Right Dmitry Kislov of association “to a weapon”, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It will be necessary to expect approximately a month and half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> It left the warehouses long life by the direction of these warehouses of mean size. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has as a whole decreased in Russia of 7% and rises with 22.9 miles while the proven cases of flight and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> United States: the employees of fast-food and the supermarkets are in strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of the American teenagers pass by a work of cash clerk at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> These last days, a wave of protest is assembled against the low wages practised by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous chains of fast-food industry such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos; S and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, nobody can predict if this wave will gain in importance or to blow itself quickly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the trade unions and a certain number of associations of left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Parallel to the modest wage increase that the basic employees at Walmart and in the chains of fast-food industry perceive, the organizers of the demonstrations wish to obtain the creation of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is not for the moment not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 hundreds a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, “black Friday”, at the moment when a breaking rain of balances seizing million inhabitants fell down on America and starting scandals sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> This day, some paid of the Walmart company, which employs in the world 2.2 million people, left their station to organize strike pickets with the trade unions and the activists of left in the stores of the company whose products are intended to the consumers of the modest and average classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart markets all: layers with the shotguns via the batteries of car, the vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are there on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in the large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> This is why much of paid evil paid at Walmart make their races only on their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of the products did of Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to criticisms, Walmart can allow itself to sell its cheap products in particular because of the low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about the difficult work conditions, for example lack of forklift trucks or scanners portable. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the manifestations of “black Friday” asked for a pay rise, they complained owing to the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased by 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the basic employee at Walmart which touches 9.5 $ of the hour, it is a sum which it cannot allow. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists of the Californian university of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wages with 12 $ of the hour, that would cost the group 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1.1% of more than the EC what he currently spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred all the wage increase on the shoulders from the consumers, each race in the store would total to them 46 hundreds more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in one year only 12.39 dollars moreover than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The partisans of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not carry any damage to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> “Black Friday” continued in the stores of 8:00 the evening to midnight the following day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 articles at the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its cases carried out in all 100 million transactions for “black Friday”. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesperson of the company Dan Fogleman ensured in an interview the site of left Huffington Post that in very “less than five” employees of Walmart their stations had left and that the protest was only one “communications operation among so much of others” on behalf of the organizing trade union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> “Following Customer!” </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York and related to either the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, this is why they are not established yet there) but McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants cheap. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announces to sell billion portions and after they do not even give you a vacation disease and do not pay you the work which you made honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, member of the Town council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage envisaged by the federal legislation and that of New York east of 7.25 $ of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food increase them with time, but little, on average its basic employees touches in New York 8.90 $ of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody touches less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> It was a time when almost a quarter of the American teenagers worked at McDonald&apos;s after the high school while living in their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw their primary source of incomes there or wished to remain there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself with interviewing employees of McDonald&apos;s which complain about having to live with these wages and sometimes having to nourish their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> In addition, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal one finds comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you will nourish them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 close to McDonald&apos;s of the 40e street and on Madison Avenue required that the cash clerks and the cooks of fast-food be at least paid 15 $ of the hour, that is to say a multiplication of more than twice than the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also asked so that trade unions in the sector of fast-food industry be created. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The American law prohibited with the administration there to prevent and to punish the protesters of a trade union by victimizations or dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration seldom simplifies the life to them. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a trade union, to seize fast-food industry remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of principal is the extraordinary rotation of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They are not agreement </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous demonstrations were held close to several to other chains to fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The moment headlight of the protest was the gathering in middle of day close to the McDonald&apos;s of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, in particular that of Jumaane Williams, member of the Town council, which declared: “McDonald&apos;s announces to sell billion portions and after they do not even give you a vacation disease and do not pay you the work which you made honestly!”. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkean democrats in sight, in particular by the candidate at the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who declared that “we all must support the employees of fast-food industry so that they obtain wages right and the economic welfare which each New Yorkean deserves. </seg>
<seg id="770"> New York Times characterized this demonstration like most important that knew the sector of fast-food industry in all its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundreds of people took part in it not counting all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is for the moment difficult to say if this spark of movement of mass will make the small ones. </seg>
<seg id="773"> “For the moment, one manages only fairly to mislead the brain” </seg>
<seg id="774"> Lately, the fans of new technologies were accustomed to perceive the reality increased through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning, it is Google which revealed this summer its current model at the time of its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it arises from the discussion with the director of the group of interactive technologies of 3D of the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of the ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect to handle virtual objects in the air with naked hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could you in a few words tell us what your group of research does? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We work on the interaction between the man and the machine and we test in same time to widen the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole remained about it for the moment with the pixels on flat panel display and sometimes with the tactile one. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of us and to guess the radical changes which will occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors constitute a step ahead, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What also books the future to us? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect made the interaction physical, much of things are held on flat panel display, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information was improved (the system receives more data), but the output, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change that and we work on systems of imagery truly 3D functioning on various technologies, in particular technologies of projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to make leave the computing world in ours, in the physical world, to make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For that, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space which surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we will be able to supplement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And to start, we remove from these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the vocal order? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is it appreciated, but isn&apos;t over-estimated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one always does not want to inform the others of his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in the public places, we had a plan for which we thought of gestures, not of the broad gestures, but rather with discrete gestures, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet carried to the hand which recorded the movements of the bones and the muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it in keeping with a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - I.e.? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you ask me to pass this quill to you? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would do it with the word and the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually, I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Therefore, do you want to force the users to adapt according to what the machine can or not to make at a given time? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not obligatorily, but it is about a mutual bringing together. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work with the development of new types of sensors which will enable us to better identify the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They can be for example the sensors laser, they produce a rather in-depth good resolution and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If one is interested in your work on the sensors Xbox Kinect, what you don&apos;t like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do they miss resolution, of depth or of another thing? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In theory, it is on the present generation that we base ourselves in our work on the recognition 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> It would be obviously well to obtain approximately 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but well the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Compared to this last point, all current technologies are rather good, that adds work with the originators of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Speed imports also much, the number of frameworks at the second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The human movements are rather dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory of Redmond gave to the touch of the sensors a regular delay of treatment ranging between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being more close to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everyone does not understand at which point that influences the interaction of the man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would need well a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more executives at the second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But shouldn&apos;t one increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect has today three “cameras”, of which one is in fact an infra-red lamp and the second, a receiver of the considered signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is in fact a usual sensor of the visible field. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could solve this problem… </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or to worsen it by increasing the necessary volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and to see how that could help to define the sites. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms presenting the most prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, to walk all the time with a smartphone the raised hands is not practical but here what I think: the best option would be an increased reality “transitory” which would enable you starting from a platform cloud to pass from the glasses to the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device and it is that which makes their force (the personal elements are those which you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased starting from the glasses will not enable you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let us imagine one moment that the handling of the virtual holographic objects in the air is more accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the ordinary human being. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem on which the opponents with this idea point the finger: there is no tactile feeling! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> Which answers your group does it prepare compared to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my courses, I often say that increased reality is the seventh opening in the interaction between the man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could wellness the very addition of the tactile feelings. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to be used as support of image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It records the pressures perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies which are really intended to allot palpability to these “images in the air”: for example the interference of several rays ultrasounds directed towards a precise point where the finger is and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blast on the ends of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also the bracelets related to the wrists which influence the nervous terminations of the fingers, they are also a work axis presenting of the prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And did you try to mislead the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Should he to make believe that it feels what it normally feel at the time when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - Here is a good idea, we did not test yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task down there on which it will be necessary still a long time to give oneself evil: the manner of making accept somebody who is physically in a very reduced space that it goes in an almost infinite opened space - we work on the concepts of the carpets of race (nothing to see with those which one finds in the clubs of fitness), of the mobile platforms and also of the giant balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, one manages only fairly to mislead the brain, it remains still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Here what returns work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in an absolute state of fecundation. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of the taste and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> “Rosbalt” continues the project “the avant-garde pétersbourgeoise” dedicated to the townsmen who are in advance, with the avant-garde of the culture and Article. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This ultra-selective list already accommodated eminent actors of the artistic scene of Saint-Pétersbourg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who found a recognition in Europe, after having been known in all Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> All the city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, very of dressed red which one can cross close to the Russian Museum, the Garden of summer or in the festivals and varnishings connected. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller always gather crowd, whatever their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical storytellers pétersbourgeois, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is eminent representing avant-garde pétersbourgeoise the end of 1980 and beginning of the years 1990. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes smile the inhabitants and good mood puts. </seg>
<seg id="856"> It recently took in its hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this Saint-Pétersbourg instrument since it had matured enough for this difficult role from his existence, its philosophy and its image of gipsy. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why you course the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red as dressmaker specialized in the aspect and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and the company. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in the company, all that is not gray causes aggressiveness and a negative agitation. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to start the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation with the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you understand that you were to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - With the exposure of the Palate of the Nevskiy culture where my work was. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that it was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of the old nonofficial painters had passed and new the, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started to bind me friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina which gave rise to “Pouchinskaya-10” and then there was not any more of vagueness. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in the theatre, the mode, the music, all the kinds safe with the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all that was found in your artistic Private clinic… - It was important for me to find me in the center of the culture of Saint-Pétersbourg where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took taken seat with Pouchkinskaya-10 which sheltered before work a musical and artistic club, a club gipsy, the house of Bohemian the pétersbourgeoise. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many was born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project “the ear of Van Gogh”. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and its friends sang easy songs in playback in grinding shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today with the mode. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group started to occur into live, it became “Leningrad”. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg animated not bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg and at this point in time its great career started, but its formation and its basic education, it is on our premises that it received them. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery “D137”, Club “Griboïedov”: they are repercussions of the artistic Private clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees left there as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the century spent, time when the culture wanted to say something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price “the personalities of our city”. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was appointed “Painter of the year”, and at this point in time my reign ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Much of my tables are hits, they have news and a very strong acuity. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exposure programmed “the Russian museum through the clowns”. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was somebody of social, today that hurt and that frightened to be thus. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, very deletes itself, the tragedy fall. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I like the grotesque one, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea to save the world via the total and obligatory disguise. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress which imports, one is interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Perhaps that one cannot give him the hand, but which it is rather necessary to spit to him with the mug. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be deleted by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Recently you saw we in the role of the organ grinder of Cruelty. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who of other that me can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But perhaps that commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur-like. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of the culture is occurring. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Front, people were shared in herds, the partisans of Bohemian liked a thing, denied them another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, all is divided into microphone-communities, it is difficult to like everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to like everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, it is necessary to think of which you will like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - They are people whom one threw which comes to see it, it is the sexual and social side which goes. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end of the day it is less management, of money, all decays. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not to mislead them, not to waste lived. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted paintings which a collector hung beside Falk or of Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the tables which usually are those that one paints at the end of the lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, the ideas are often confused. </seg>
<seg id="911"> One says: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption does not have culture, that does not have anything to see. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and which precisely refused the money for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, which lack with Saint-Pétersbourg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the civil servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But all cannot work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of the good tsars, they were not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are good consultants today. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here with Saint-Pétersbourg who could be experts, but they are isolated, because one needs higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and will cut through a path to them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the “reign of the taste” which flowers. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Same Erarta, but they are differed in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must be other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is it Saint-Pétersbourg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint-Pétersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is in Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art has difficulty pushing. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are much curious which will see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> On our premises, this layer is very fine. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must return art to the mode as it was the case at the beginning of last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project carried out with the support of the purse of Saint-Pétersbourg </seg>
<seg id="932"> To be confined in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Climate warming or collision with a fatal asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with the land ones on board leave in search of a planet help. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a great question arises: how to continue to make live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of help? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much the choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two true planets which one can conquer, this would be only by assumption. </seg>
<seg id="939"> “It is of Venus and Mars”, Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of astronomical Institut of State P.K estimates. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> So over Mars the conditions are adapted for the life, the temperature on the Venus surface is of 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> One can live there only with very high altitude or on the Venus orbit… in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> One started to be interested in the questions of the reproduction in space while focusing oneself about the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Still a half-century ago, one carried out experiments on the plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of garden peas cultivated on orbit were not different in any manner of the land varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, one put on orbit of the insects, the small flies reproductive drosophilas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent in the space to see how an embryo in weightlessness developed. </seg>
<seg id="947"> One obtains at the exit a completely normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems start. </seg>
<seg id="949"> “The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must be put on its legs and start to move”, explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of the medico--biological problems of the Academy of Science of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By not finding any support, the chicks were agitated in a disordered way. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And at the end of 10 a.m., the new born ones entirely saw their instincts being atrophied. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks reacted neither to the light nor with the sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they would die quite simply at the end of quattre days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> “Opened wide We to them the eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is quite simply impossible to work with them over there”, explains Vladimir Sychev by noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last “miniature arch” biological with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite “Bion” will embark only species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was experience with rats sent with their foetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In theory, nothing supernatural was discovered. </seg>
<seg id="960"> “They was still the biosatellites and then it is the only experiment. _it be necessary carry out this kind of research”, point out remarquer Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, one does not manage yet to carry out reproductions directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is not a small matter. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their usual medium, the animals are not any more able to carry out their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Contrary to the animals, the man in is able, in theory. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has the abstracted thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional bottom. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This kind of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women have gone in space for already 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The largest chance was taken by Terechkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female organization is what humanity has of more invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew away and nobody on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If it could have given birth to a child after the vol. </seg>
<seg id="973"> “Nobody answered this question”, explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, reprocessed sector of the rockets and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after her flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and to have even worked in extra-vehicular medium, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk continues. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very few cosmonauts who did not have anything and who give rise to a descent in full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> “And if they are longer, that presents a danger even during the flights in orbit”, concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnologies, protection against radiations and the creation of an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Preparation centre of the cosmonauts: obligatory stage of the preparation with the vol. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, of worthless buoyancy, the cosmonauts involve themselves at the extra-vehicular exits. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water imitates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> So for the adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign medium, for the infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Insofar as the baby evolves approximately 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of the belly of his mother, it is easier to him to be accustomed then to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is in theory logical, because since its birth until its first bath, it occurs only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> “Is very little to forget”, explains the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, so for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, basin are atrophied very quickly, the capacity of pushed of the baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Good of agreement, let us be unaware of that by pressing us on the simulators of childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> One can of course prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will be able to make it leave. </seg>
<seg id="993"> “And then?” ask Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If it does not feel the earth&apos;s gravitational force, the organization does not form the skeleton nor the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> One cannot equip an infant like an adult with a special combination for the trainings. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will be quite simply private of its vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> “And this experiment which we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to earth of a handicapped child, entirely made unsuitable”, envisages the Director of the committee for the bioethics of the Institute of the medico--biological problems of the Academy of Science of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of the children in space still concerns the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time that will become reality, when the Land ones go in their shuttles towards a remote planet which will become the habitat of their descent born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The chief of the ISC (higher Institution of control of public finances) declared: “the control of the pseudonym free-lance work (into Czech” Švarc system “) failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field as of public contracts, the Czech Republic lays out qualified inspectors and of a legislation of quality but it is with the drag as regards its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> It is what Miloslav Kala declared, the vice-president of the higher Institution of control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> “The law will be never perfect, but its application must be right and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking on our premises”, Kala in its comment of the current situation declared. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control carried out jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> It quotes like example of abusive practuice the approach of the “Švarc system” by Petr Ne čas. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Mister the Prime Minister recently declared that the ODS was not going to importune the entrepreneurs with controls; is this thus allowed or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> “The law owes wellness in one way or another applied, then if it prohibits something, even the chief of the government cannot prevent from acting an authority in charge to go to inspect to require the respect of the law”, Kala notes. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> During the meeting of the Audit Board to the Chamber of Deputies, you evoked a project tchéco-German within the framework of which the legislations as regards public contracts of these two countries were compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> Of what was it question concretely? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is about a parallel control which we launched there is that approximately two years. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the EU law how envisages to manage the public contracts and of the particular national legislations as well as a practice itself make him continuation. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We gathered all that and although this control procedure is not completed yet, of the very interesting differences appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps “more severe and of better quality”, nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This thus confirms that it is not enough continuously to work out increasingly detailed rules but which it is necessary to sanction to the application even right. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> In what this project can it help you concretely and which it results for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should precisely contribute so that we stop endeavouring to specify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when that does not have a really positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means to obtain the thing in question with a reasonable price (what does not want always to say low), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, one will not achieve this goal inevitably. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It could be that this system is at such point submerged by the paperwork, that those which seek the faults of them will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak about internal problems concerning the practical application of the legislation of the public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the monitoring system in Germany function? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Does there exist an institution similar to our ISC or a different fashion of organization? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards the institutions, in the same way with the ISC, Bundesrechnungshof functions over there which is organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it thus has also course of the accounts of this type with the level of different Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds on our premises to the financial resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds managed on our premises by the areas and the municipalities, are controlled over there on the level as of course of the accounts of Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to is the national legislation, simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would not like to make general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in certain fields, Germany is often indicated as a model but one cannot surely say that it does better in all the fields. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Is it perhaps due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Not, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data of comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it should be also said that this country that we regard as a model is also confronted with a whole series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If not wouldn&apos;t they have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to are the national legislation, which meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on the public contracts, its effects already felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment having come into effect relatively recently, it does not have impact yet on our check operations. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we make back testings, it is necessary to take into account a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations relate to only, for the moment, the procedure processing of future controls - we launched a new instrument of “detection of the risks of bad management” with which we screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds were modified as well as the conditions of certain types of procedures of invitations to tender and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you thus rather consider the adoption of this law as an advantage or like an addition of load for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law constitutes a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem which can occur is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to respect them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the mode of the previous regulation, the person receiving benefits (for example the regional council, in the case of operational programmes regional) forced the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means failure with the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it thus really useful to make the law more severe in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Not, not in this way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those which want to tackle the system or deceive them but not punish those which make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put of advantage of pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Which is thus the solution to leave itself there? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us look towards where we do not go. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, did the Prime Minister declare that the ODS was not going to importune the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law in one way or another owes to wellness applied, then if it prohibits something, even the chief of the government cannot prevent from acting an authority in charge to go to inspect and to require the respect of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It can declare: “We will change the law and will authorize it”, but it cannot say that we will act as so of nothing was not. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets comprises relatively strict rules on the formalities to be achieved and this, precisely in order to protect the invitation to tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is in addition tragic that a tenderer is eliminated only due to formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will be never perfect, but its application must be right and it is, in my opinion, which is lacking on our premises. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads by places are frozen, but the majority remain practicable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> At certain places of the Czech Republic, the roads are cold and also snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network remains however in major practicable part, at certain places with an increased vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Area of Karlovy Vary </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the area of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this morning practicable, but by places cold and also snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperatures fell and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should slightly go up in the course of the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The snowfalls ceased in the area and it remains in the plains only one fine layer of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The peaks of the metalliferous Mounts (Krušné hory) are however covered with approximately 30 centimeters of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It arises from the data of the regional service of maintenance of the roads that because of the fog, the visibility was by places reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The R6 fast track and the trunk roads of the region are from now on practicable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Vigilance remains however with setting, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be cold and slipping. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All the secondary roads and the ways of third category, including the mountain roads, are also practicable. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> There remain still on certain their sections of the remains of cold snow and by places packed by the traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in the zones located in altitude, the drivers must reinforce their vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Areas of Pardubice and Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The Management of the roads and motorways announces on its Web site that certain roads of Bohemian of the East are threatened by the formation of glaze and that layers of snow packed by the traffic can be on the roads in the mountainous areas and located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The services of maintenance of the roads warn the drivers against the risks of formation of glaze in the zones of the area of Pardubice located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> There can be glaze in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the secondary roads and of third category. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The roads I/43 and I/34 in the neighbourhoods of Svitavy were treated chemically. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> Snow is mainly in the Mounts of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mounts of the Eagle (Orlické hory). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by the traffic is present on the roads in the zones located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Into Bohemian from the East, time dry, will be generally disengaged today, with possible cloudy passages. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> It will blow a weak wind and the temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and + 1° C. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Pilsen area </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The roads of the Pilsen area are practicable today, although, by places, it is advisable to show an increased vigilance and to adapt its control to the weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It freezes this morning, the temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After the last snowfalls and the cooling which followed, certain transportation routes can be by places cold. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> The drivers can expect to cross zones of fog, the visibility will improve however gradually. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> It is what it arises from information of the regional service of maintenance of the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The D5 motorway is practicable almost without difficulties, the services of maintenance of the road communications recommends however an increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The coating of the majority of the trunk roads is dry and cold. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Certain sections can be cold in the district of Pilsen-South and the district of Tachov. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The departmental ways and of third category are wet and in this case applies the warning statement against the cold sections. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> The drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on the less attended roads of the area of Šumava. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Area of Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="1089"> The drivers going in the zones of the area of Olomouc located in altitude must take into account a thick and soft layer of snow today on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> This layer remained on the collar says “Červenohorské sedlo” and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž, after the operations of chemical treatment. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The snowfalls have constrained this night the staff of maintenance of the roads to go on the ground; according to the services in charge of the roadway system, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In the other parts of the area, most roadways are practicable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> “On the heights of the district of Šumperk remains of snow are. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> The drivers circulating in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet with the collar says “Červenohorské sedlo” a layer of snow thick and soft” with ČTK the chief of the services of maintenance of the roads of the district of Šumperk declared today. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Their colleagues of the district of Jeseník also went to the site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads, are now released and wet, even in the highest zones. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> In the district of Olomouc the roads are practicable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should however pay attention in the sections in forest zones to the roadways remained wet. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Areas of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec </seg>
<seg id="1098"> As of this morning, the services of maintenance of the roads of Bohemian of North announced several difficult sections. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> It arises from the data of the police, that besides certain places covered with snow or glaze, the mountain road going from Telnice to Knínice Na Ústecku is closed. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and thus snow and the glaze should be maintained on the roads. In the plains, in particular in the south east of the central Plate of Bohemian, there is not, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> No traffic jam was announced for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> The services of maintenance of the roads announced the presence of glaze, in particular in the neighbourhoods of Štětí. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal with its formation: rain and cast iron of snow during the day, a clear sky and freezing during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> One also announces, since the main axes of circulation, of the difficult conditions on the trunk road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The closing of circulation between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which were curved under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest declared: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy. ” </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think owing to the fact that in less than one month it should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one of this alarming news, the kind of traps into which we like to fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, one laughs about it rather and one thinks that we are the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to push back or to prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, you assemble in December a completely single project: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you present more in detail this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charitable action which we have prepared for already two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21st at 11 hours 10 of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on December 20th, three concerts will simultaneously proceed, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will practically finish at the time when will end the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone in 12 hours advance compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> At the beginning I think that it was my idea, then we very conceived with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect sufficient positive energy to save the world, we want also together, with the public, to think of the state of the world which we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the time of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of single objects, in particular of the shoes, Tee-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled “Fine world cancelled” (in Czech “Konec světa zrušeno”). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It already very popular on YouTube, is one will also hear it at the time of these caritative concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place… </seg>
<seg id="1123"> She will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems will also meet at a time given within the framework of a live emission, completely single, Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák which also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there… </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come from there to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show biz, because owing to the fact that we organize many concerts and caritative events… </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We endeavour to make them take part intensively in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It proved that most between them are interested by such a co-operation and that amuses them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> With what will serve the benefit as these concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to the people with reduced mobility and we have worked with the realization within the framework of the Jedlička institute, with association Tap, and that for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers go regularly to the pupils of the institute Jedličkův and activities propose to them which interest them and amuse them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means of going to courses, we try to help them in this manner. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Within the framework of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička institute, we will transfer this project in a new independent building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Will several groups of music and interpreters go up on scene at the time of each one of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to which criteria, did you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to work out a program which is addressed to all the generations, including the children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will go up on Chinaski scene, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you also prepare with others “méga events” of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time within the framework of the spring of Prague; there too, we will prepare surely a programme of quality with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play the next year in the house from the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the spot in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimalists, up to now you played for example Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is nevertheless a made up group handicapped people. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your rounds? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so terrible which that looks with the first access. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We naturally have five members in electric armchair whose machines must travel out of compartment, we take also many luggage and boxes of instruments…. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Up to now very happened more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were prepared always perfectly for us, they astonished me more once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even to Moscow, from where we returned recently, very happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare in what these countries differ as regards the accessibilities for the people to reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion with respect to the handicapped people and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Which were your experiments until now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where all functions better than on our premises, we were precisely pilot in Moscow that in the east all is yet only in one initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is still far from accessible to the handicapped people; over there, it is not yet current that a person only moves in electric armchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not regard yet as an obviousness to give priority to a person in armchair in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, over there also, an association endeavouring to draw attention to the problems of the handicapped people is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what do have we to still catch up with more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things for which we are still late… </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts made by the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is completely current that people with a heavy handicap only move in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, with the museum, anywhere… </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is nevertheless not very frequent over there that a large number of handicapped people take an active part in the social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary to the forefront of progress! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and the accessibilities are a thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, they are only isolated cases people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Is the group The Tap Tap currently very popular, turn over behind a few years, which this group pushed you to create in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as a teacher at the Jedlička institute, where I was surrounded by many young loans to invest itself in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am myself musician (I play, inter alia, of the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with time, like known as our regulator Láďa Angelovič, one lost a little the control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Did success arrive only during these last years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, the fact of creating bonds with known singers and to work actively with the promotion of the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if there did not exist in the content. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, moreover, to allow us to have professors of quality, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> As of the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change the things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The show business is full with tricks which copy the ones the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a certain way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with prudence and that lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Rare are the original projects, and I dare to affirm that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural… </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But pity is completely useless, because people with a handicap are not suffering beings, abandoned of all, that we must take in pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live a life except for whole and open out, on condition that having of them the means necessary of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with a handicap manage to carry out something, it is not only one projection for them but for all the company. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Isn&apos;t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified per many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do work of quality, we must be intransigent in many fields and require a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Certain people arrive on our premises with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the repetitions twice per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend much time on the roads for the concerts, they lose their enthusiasm quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that functions in the same way in each group which wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently counts twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How much between them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one, Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an opened group, people enter and leave, one cannot nothing there. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Is always opened with those which want or would want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> That will be the case the day before day envisaged of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 as from 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will proceed in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno with Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when is sung jointly the cancelled song of the group The Tap Tap “Fine of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The goal of the concert is to gather financial means (with height of 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multipurpose Studeo which is in Prague in the Jedlička institute. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to this concert is of 400 CZK, the entry is free for the children up to 12 years, the prévente of the tickets is opened in Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, during the ministerial meeting of the countries of the European space agency, Poland was allowed as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the old Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became member except for whole on November 12th, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had started a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and during years which followed took part in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road of Poland towards space however began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the Second World War, of the impassioned Poles worked on space flights; they always did not meet comprehension. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like to evoke for example the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on December 6th, 1933, during which it presented ideas drawn from its work of avant-garde entitled “Introduction to astronautics”. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and of the years later Šternfeld remembered that only Doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work “Introduction to astronautics”. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The aforementioned Doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became thereafter a large propagator of astronomy and astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> It published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many dedicated works with this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagator of the astronautics of world famous, its contribution was in particular rewarded by the fact that its name was given to the one of the craters of the hidden side of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> By 1925 was built in Poland a line inspection car intended to be been driven by a rocket motor. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> One knows neither the author unfortunately nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clearly either if the rocket were to be used for propelling or braking the line inspection car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known on this line inspection car is those of the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Starting from 1933, the Polish artillery started to be devoted to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The researches were undertaken by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It arises from the preserved documents that this research had reached the testing stage. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric rocket of hunting, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work “Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza” of an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects had as a finality a military use of the engines of rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Right before the war, all the projects of use of the technique of the rockets were carried out by the provisional advisory scientific committee (“Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy”), which coordinated all work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, the other work devoted to aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the company Polish astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is question of a company in the number of November 1954 of the newspaper Problem, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics are. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company devoted to astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> With the beginning of the year 1956, the company Polish astronautics (PTA) made efforts to enter international the astronautics federation (created in 1951) and as of the autumn, the PTA became a regular member about it. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of international the astronautics federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> It preserved its function until its death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Starting from 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the crowned development of success of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific researches. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, were finished in 1957 and the first launching took place on October 10th, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket of a range of 1800 meters had a 80 cm length and weighed a little less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Thereafter was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer 1959, of the tests of flight of the rocket on two floors RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a length of 1.4 meter and probably weighed 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have had a range going up to 14.5 km and have been used to observe the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all work of development was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of the type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, designed with two stages, had an overall length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were characterized by dimensions from reserved space to the scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was of 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liter. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of machine was of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> During the time 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first tests of flight began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Thereafter the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is still advisable to mention the entry of Poland with the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland also took part in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second cosmonaut not-Soviet of this program. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abrogation of the law on work of public utility is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional court repealed the law on work of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision raised in the public opinion a sharp discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is without any doubt interesting to examine these problems from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems directed towards liberalism, as well in the EU as in the context of globalization, are founded on the principle of more than not regulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means concretely that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict the ones with the others. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free circulation (without limits) from the private capital combined with an unrestrained financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The considerable differences of the price of work (wages) generate a tension on the prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is advisable to put under this term the following significance: a producer makes an effort by the importation of goods sold with bottom taken to resist economic competition in “expensive returning” the price of the competitor, with an aim of removing a greater market share and of thus increasing his own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer the production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in the countries where the prices of work are high in comparison with other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital is not any responsible from the social point of view and consequently for responsibility with respect to the unemployment which it generates, the social contributions of the State necessarily increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused with the whole of the company by this race with the profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is at such a point of public notoriety which it is not necessary to provide of the concrete statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The practices without scruples of the private capital generate in the various economies a situation in which the governments of the various countries are constrained to launch out in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social status of their own population with an aim of attracting the foreign assets on their premises. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments put their own population at the mercy of capital deprived without taking account of social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This appears mainly in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of the prices of the private capital, in particular in the field of the wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of the employees in the field of the industrial legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> It results an increasing poverty from it and the deepening from the differences between the rich person and the poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In FRG, there exists since years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor which cannot provide for their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> One already counts per million the number of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes completely current that the employees receive such wages that the State is seen constrained to pay a supplement so that they reach the vital minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal for example was updated in the case of the employees working like auxiliaries at the federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Measurements of saving in practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate, without any doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the company, people are constrained either to emigrate (as it was the case at the 19th century), or to live sparely with starvation wages, in margin of the company, in the hope which one day the private capital invests in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Should here be raised the following question: from which will this capital come? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty will pass from a country to another; this capital can not come either, or then an Chinese, an Indian, Brazilian, a Turk, a Morrocan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This relates to also all the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media affirm, to weary itself some, that the State cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital defends the idea bitterly that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulating interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It should then be wondered whether the private capital does not influence and, even, does not direct today, depending on its egoistic own interests, the policy and by the same one, the entire State. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is without any doubt yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there exists a lobby the practically Almighty and present in all the States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> It results a desperate plight from it appearing in the field from corruption, by the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where all is condemnable but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In FRG, the situation is such, that because of the lack of means financial, the national ministries delegate the development of the government bills to law firms closely related to industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The totality of the power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type declare it, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is manifest that the democracies directed towards liberalism are seen now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in its work entitled “the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of César and of Pumped”: “The State was for a long time in full deliquescence and the functions were allotted by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Blows of bribes, favours obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these stations. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The under the counter payments and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold voices”… … “honest people at all did not seek themselves to obtain functions, it resulted from it once the State remained 8 months without consuls”…. &apos;One really started to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man”… It is true that Appianos with the spirit Had pumped, but it is César which transformed irréversiblement the democracy into absolutist mode. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is founded on the preference of the personal profit, without regards for the interest of the company as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In its petrol, the private capital is not able any more to understand and put forward the interests of the company as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> It results from it, today like formerly, a decline without preceding by the elites, any effort to carry out in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must thus seek the causes of the emergence of the fascistic and communist modes in liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the actual position of the things, one can consider the disappearance of these systems to the profit as of democracies of the liberal type a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current elites are unaware of completely the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian crises and social of which we are the witnesses today as well as the crimes against humanity such as we know them from the ancient history and recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abrogation of the law on work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, as well with the international plan as on the level interns European, the government of the Czech Republic will be constrained to continue to search means of decreasing the social status of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is indeed systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution consists into cubes reforms with sociopolitical aimings, which will reinforce the investments in capital of the State in the economy, will increase the influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of monopoly of the capital deprived in the company with the profit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> “Nothing will never leave violence and never will not be able” declares Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose worms the main thing of the refrain is “do not forget how much we are fragile”. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “If my sons did not want wars, there would not be”, affirmed Gutele Schnaper, the woman of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the last wave of violences between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, of many reactions rose. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some opt for Israel, putting forward its right to the self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling upon the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide made against the Arabs of Palestine and regarding Israel as a terrorist State. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to reflect on the question of knowing which is guilty and which is victim, in its waves of recurring slaughters; altogether, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not live the beginning of violences. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer to the readers a point of view located “behind the curtain”, on that with which benefit mainly from the tensions which have continued already for more than 95 years (as from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a short period of country of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available under investigation, others come out from my own comprehension of that, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the principal instigator of the events of the modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is before all the history of a fight for the power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> At each time, we can find a Alexandre the Large one or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so obvious is to know if these individualities acted in an independent way or if they owed their acts with the throne with somebody who directed their acts according to beforehand definite objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live at one time when the world wealth is concentrated between the hands of some individuals and which this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be made during one only generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the families having an astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the family Rothschild, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I am unaware of if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written on their subject. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> As of the Nineties of the 19th century, they acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of bonds between their name and serious criminal acts with which they were mixed and which had always meant for them reinforcement to be able to them, an increase in their fortune or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major participations in almost most central banks of the world and prepare or carry out wars against the countries in which they do not have such participations yet (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were of 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the inversion of Kadhafi only of 4, meanwhile Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Any person who tried to draw up herself against this family died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew in Bank of America of Rothschild the statute of central bank and started to emit during the civil war clean sound money (governmental, I hear well) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK started to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, it was assassinated in 1963, the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 whereas it wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF to have started the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for being able on a world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated with the 33e degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aimed to eliminate great official monarchies from Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, in particular British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create only one universal religion (oecumenism not being anything else that the starter of such a solution) and, with final, acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families with at their head Rothschild consists in creating a crisis then to suggest a solution then (order ab chaos - the order following chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent that are not repeated crises as those which they caused in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After having succeeded in starting the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo de Ferdinand, Habsbourg heir with the throne Austro-Hungarian, they destroyed Russia tsarist by causing the revolution Bolshevik. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended abruptly in a German capitulation without justifications economic and military (the war was not necessary any more to the destruction of Russia tsarist) and it was followed by the parcelling out of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier release of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a conflict situation latent: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of amazing war reparations thus generating the conditions of a toughening of the impoverished masses (it is enough for them then to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing finger of the culprits, suggesting simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created Czechoslovakia made up of various nationalities, including strong German minority which was to play the part (that it held indeed) of fifth column to spark off an explosion and to start a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield inspired the creation of the movement Zionist, of which one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judaea with Jerusalem like capital (return to Sion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The declaration of Balfour mentioned above posed the bases of a massive emigration of Jews towards Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population started. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were made on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war burst; it is difficult to appreciate if Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had held it initially; or if all that it has fact were planned, the fact is however that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; same manner as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a hearth of fire which can cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was it during the Second World War, the first victim of the combat, this time just as the Arab or generally Moslem population of the Middle-East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but with the international level (it is enough to see how people divide bitterly between partisans and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is victim in the israélo-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where does one find, at the origin of all, the cupidity of certain individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the whole world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is necessary here to make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like on our premises, the international bankers propose to people with the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Current the Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist, honest politician with respect to the international bankers, who does all in order to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the adhesion of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc…) to extend to become a world war and, since Iran controls the strait of Ormuz by which 20% of all world oil forward (this naval corridor has a width only of 2 miles) and to generate a destruction of the worldwide economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under which light the remarks made by David Rockefeller appear now in 1994: “The only thing which we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.” </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their idea, the new world order is a world of Masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is useful by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which very new born sees itself establishing with the birth an electronic chip making of him a completely controlled being. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> “That they force all the individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be related to the hand or the face a brand to red iron, so that it can neither buy nor to sell that which is not called after this wild animal or the figure of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand: that which has good sense counts the figures of this wild animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number designates the man and it is six hundred sixty-six.” </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Argo film: when all goes to most badly, to call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a bunch of demonstrators made up of islamist students took attack the American embassy of Teheran and retained hostages 52 diplomats. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in return for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled in the United States, which had supported its mode for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the American administration of positive exit, it could not, indeed, give up the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic mode, it was not able to obtain the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a heavy blow for the prestige of the United States, blow still worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt at release of the hostages by the force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate caused in the United States a wave of solidarity and a feeling anti-Iranian. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian rout strongly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter vis-a-vis Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The Argo film, of the actor and director Ben Affleck, described an episode of this history which offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated adventures, they were found in the residence of the ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to make them leave Iran thanks to a fantastic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of turning come to make locations for the turning of a film with large show of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of the kinds </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, of store specialized mentioned this project of film, of the press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained a long time secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film of Affleck is an unusual combination several kinds. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is on the one hand about a conceived political thriller in a realistic way but also one “to wrap movie”, the account at a stretch successful, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&apos; S eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Environments follow one another: sequences of documentary Teheran of style (in the subtitled sequences iconic photographs of the time of the events and the manner are presented whose, thanks to these photographs, these same situations were retranscribed in the film, it does not have there great differences), </seg>
<seg id="1355"> lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> and then scenes of the general headquarter of the CIA and other institutions with dressed up men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the telephone… </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck succeeded in starting again his career in a remarkable way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Of ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and its game of actor ceased causing ironic remarks. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is its third feature film after the dark police officer “Gone Gone Baby” (2007) and the thriller “The town” (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film of Affleck which is not held in its town of origin, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The direction of the atmosphere of a place constitutes one of the characteristics which placed its first films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck also shows this direction of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran “is held” by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film are held in streets, during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clearness which also suggests confusion and the unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and its collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (team of turning in the bazaar of Teheran distorts it). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many actions to too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to be satisfied with a subject not offering in fact that few palpitating scenes, with the cinematographic direction of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> It is left there extremely well, it adds sometimes certain elements with reality and there, the result is not always also elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis to the airport of Teheran is drawn aside by a telephone call in America and the continuation on the runway are drawn enough by the hair). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, which had with the need for showing too many events to too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are completely charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a larger place and it is not, far from there, only in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film of Affleck misses a little dramatic tension, it is let see with a moderated interest, by appreciating the realization and the pre-1940s style of the Seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It involves the spectator, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a recall of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and like illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services like omnipotent and omniscient, he gets the bargain. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The www.bankovnipoplatky.com waiter, which investigates each year a public survey the bank charges absurdest, decided, now, to launch the competition of the regulation or the ideas coming from “absurdest workshop EU”. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> “The fact that the EU considers, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the direction of the European large companies was at the origin of our decision”, for the Právo newspaper the organizer of this investigation declared, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nonsenses mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now however, the women were favoured as regards the rates of the life insurances because they represent, objectively, a less risk for the insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can announce until the end of the year any other so incredible idea of “the workshop of the EU”. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> “The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013”, Nacher informed. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the discussed regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add components organic to the fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or prohibition to use the reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of hens, which involved the raising of prices of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticisms were also emitted in the past against the prohibition in fact to use the expression “butters to paste” or of the withdrawal of the sale of the classical bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The bananas of quality must have a size of 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests for its banks while threatening to use its right to veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the lobbies are also, for example, at the origin owing to the fact that in the Union, the bananas should not be of a size lower than 14 cm nor to have a “abnormal curve”. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself while arguing that it did nothing but harmonize nonhomogeneous national standards which complicated the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards concerning the fruit and vegetables were softened in spite of the opposition of certain States, applicant whom the existing directives involve a wasting of foodstuffs. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first price will be can be decreed in this investigation with the regulation of the EU of last year according to which must be reproduced on the inflatable balloons a warning indicating that the children of less than 8 years should not inflate without monitoring of adults. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has refers to an American investigation according to which the balloons are, among the toys, the first cause of death of children by smothering. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to the children of less than 14 years as regards blowing in trumpets of fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> On our premises also, one has odd ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person having an official function within the EU cannot use the name “Macedonia” and owes, in the place, speech of FYROM (To form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with association “Let Make” gathering liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com waiter named in this investigation, in addition to certain nonsenses mentioned above, the regulation of the Union relating to the volume of the reserves of food substances into the territory of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had fixed maximum volumes for the reserves of food substances being able to be on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our adhesion at the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked, so a door amends. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this investigation considered to be interesting the idea to pay money sums with certain countries because they do not have an access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy to ask for the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas are however not originating in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> “The fact of not having sea handicaps us. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will request from the European Union a refunding”. Thus expressed itself, with the autumn 2004, the Minister for the Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He asserted that, because of our production of wheat, and following the purchases known as “interventionists”, the State had been found with full stocks which he had then had to export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU should have poured us million euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the final analysis, the European Commission accepted the Czech request and organized an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat coming from the countries without maritime access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidies for obtaining subsidies were proposed with the communes by the ministry for the Local development directed by the minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), those were, concretely, to be used to write requests for subsidies granted by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU declares: “the odd regulations are rare”. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations often cause criticisms in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by HAVE regulation improvement of the effectiveness of the operation of the Union like in the field of its general development, praises deserve rather. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of subsidies of the EU for projects which do not have absolutely anything to see with the reinforcement of European integration, but which was imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic must, like other Convention countries, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these products traditional (fight which it does not leave always victorious) causes sharp emotions among Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> So at the end six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs defended successfully the denomination “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, for what name “Tuzemský rum” which goes back on our premises to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the denomination “Tuzemák”. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products containing cane sugar alcohol, and not containing beet sugar, can carry the rum denomination. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of the recorded products of the EU, one finds accompanied by cheeses universally known today like Feta or the Gorgonzola, the marsipan cake of Lübeck or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (“Karlovarské suchary”), carps of Pohořelice and Třeboň (“Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr”) and hops of Žatec (“Žatecký chmel”). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread of Pardubice (“Pardubický perník”) and the cakes called “Horns of Hořice” (“hořické trubičky”) can also be proud of their Community brand. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want that I save the Republic, but I am only one amateur, declares senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mister the Senator, how does one have the idea to present himself to the presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not to be a senator or president who counts for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If all functioned without problems in our country, I would not be candidate nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I do not support more to see as the country has been plundered for these twenty last years, than the robbers are not under the bolts and the taxes and the age of the departure to the retirement increase. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I did not have the ambition to become politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I then see something which I do not like, I try to bring a solution so that changes. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than forty years and that I am independent, member of any party, I do not have other solutions to influence the situation to only present itself to the presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered to the Senate but you put yourselves quickly on the way for the Castle (N.d.T.: sit of the presidency). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Don&apos;t you thus turn your back on those which elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that I will launch out in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Thereafter, I specified that if I were elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, this one is only one instrument enabling me to carry out my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> This is why I need the largest influence and the broadest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that as a nation we give a death rattle with the bar or in front of our tv station, but it is also that we trample cough those which try to bring change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To that the press is added who breaks the reputation of the people and confuses free speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> One, for example, affirmed on my subject that I bribe the journalists or that I was the advisor of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let us come to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You started the fight for the Castle with like hobby horse the topics of the material and penal responsibility for the politicians and the retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You must for this purpose change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As a president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I put pressure so that the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won the case. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem it is the backroom politics: when somebody arrives of left or right-hand side with a good project, this one is knowingly refused and that delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Like independent, member of any party, I am likely much more to obtain the support of all the parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take each party what there is the best for our country and to apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you regard yourselves rather as a left or man of the right? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From a Czech point of view, I have the feeling which people place me rather on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that it is a little on the left or on the right, it is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, important it is that we went from the front one. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, it is not that people are of left or right-hand side but to gather people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution contributing to the community property, even if she is proposed by the Communist party or ODS and I acted also impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you flare up when somebody known as of you who you are populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you declared doesn&apos;t prove it? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you work out a plane business in a company, you have also a certain optimal goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to bring you closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some can call that of the populism, but all the proposals of which I speak were applied by the world and about the recognized experts spoke about it. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the Parliament, there remain to you only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You will not survive a long time in policy with that. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you will see people and their speech, you will make a success of, for example, to impose the material and penal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I do not have another option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> It is necessary me to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public opinion and to try to rejoin them with my camp in order to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to live broadcast on television my request with the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and penal responsibility politicians, civils servant, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they do not want any. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality which will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for example the election of the president by the direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I acknowledge, to the point, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just launched me in policy and I try to obtain the support of the majority for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try, only, to advance the things, and if that does not go, I will stop in six years and I will turn over in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is a little as if Okamura were to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a saver. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that only one person cannot make the difference, this is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present itself to the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the quantity of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I have at least constant the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencová which revealed the frauds with fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I presented myself because people are really disgruntled but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not vote and what have it fact have, for the majority, given their voice to a representative of the Establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> With the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People elected a Senate which will be able to impose changes with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by the direct suffrage of the mayors and the regional prefects. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to found your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Not, not yet, because I do not have time to check if the past of each potential member is without spot and then I do not have financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I do not have either money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my “transparent” account. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Don&apos;t you have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Do you speak about tax declarations, which is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I estimate at approximately 60 million the value of my personal goods. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have in Prague a ground of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value of ten million, another apartment being worth 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of approximately ten million, an Aston Martin which is worth 3.5 million and Škoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> It should be said in passing, I have an Aston Martin, because it one was dreamed of kid: I always loved James Bond, who drived car, was gallant with the women and fought against the evil and the abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Do you roll in Aston Martin, do you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and don&apos;t you have money for your countryside? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Do you want to change the Republic but don&apos;t you want to invest your own money there? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million for this countryside. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I involve in debt me? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I already invested 2 million and half in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I do not have any sponsor shows well that my program does not arouse a great interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I do not have the obligation to pay this countryside of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My expenses of countryside are covered overall by the remuneration which I will receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live on it, for example to pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only objective were to earn money, I will not present myself to any election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Will you thus continue your marketing activities to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Hadn&apos;t you affirmed that you would put your activities out of silencing device? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take over in spring the leadership of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I would be a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> It is however necessary well that I live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> Which was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I gained and I continue to gain between two hundreds and four hundred and thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my marketing activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in the edition of Saturday of the Práva newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of cabinet MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only business of imagination. To be convinced some, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books lately set up - 2 photographs </seg>
<seg id="1502"> “I find that this building is funny, the weather is very futuristic, finally something of interesting to see”, us says Lisette Verhaig, busy on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a data processing specialist in a close large company, tells us: “Yes, it is indeed quite beautiful, this building”. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has Internet, a iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody any more does go from full sound liking in one of these old-fashioned libraries, not? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory town which does not have anything of attracting with the doors Rotterdam, holds a rather particular record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The commune of 80.000 hearts displays the lowest rate of the education of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to give again some neurons with the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general knowledge and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges which are reproduced on the tickets of euros in the form pretty small painted reinforced concrete miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Thus the authorities of the city realized that there was only one way of taking again the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, Master of the diagrams in daring and creative sticks of buildings full with spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a snigger on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury still looked at themselves, disconcerted and raising the shoulders, Maas, the shameless one, piled up its books of choice by order of size to make a pyramid of it, and finished its backed up speech of arguments activists by one: “dear commune!” </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or like one says, Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros spouted out of ground. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building falls under a project of revitalization also comprising an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and semidetached houses for a total of 50 dwellings. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize “Best Library of NL 2012”. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Moreover, the project was selected for National Dutch Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus this small village dull, which until today had nothing more to offer that pedestrian precinct postmodern and town hall by ugliness confusing, whose white frontages invite to think that they shelter a dairy, grew rich by a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Most important, it is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long way towards the reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese cover. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Admittedly, an elevator transports you in the middle of the solid mass, but the true joys of the reading and architecture open with you when you press the ground of the building on a tour of his topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The entirely made interior of glass is luminous and clear, the ground out of clinker bricks and the reverberators elegant speak unambiguous the language about the municipal public places. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> One seeks already glance of the public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere of the books, the books and still of the books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> “Normally, the rays of library are along the frontage and in the medium is a large room and sinks, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal”, explains Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We completely upset the classical space configuration and opened spaces of reading of the interior towards outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books was skilfully arranged: in the medium are the offices, library Internet, the club of failures, the center for the environment and the technical power station of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes skirtings, sometimes balustrades, sometimes of the slopes of staircase. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experiment for the sight, the touch and the sense of smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and the hardened engineers of the building do not want materials unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> “We wanted to work with recycled materials”, explains Joop Trouborst, chief of the project near the commune of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Thus one day we found in a Friesian agricultural company a waste ad hoc resulting from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, one uses since years of the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness like substrate in the greenhouses and the fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> They is cheap and time is saved. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The fine membrane is used during one or two seasons, then one can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time into cubes such quantities, in plates a four centimetres thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the effect of heat and pressure, the “Landbouwplastic” (KPL) changes color and is transformed into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose odor evokes at the same time a new car and sport shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of 105 steps the top of the mountain is. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers a unspoilable view to us on the city, but also of the Dutch croquettes and the ficuses out of pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of moisture of the air of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Gifts for the new heart </seg>
<seg id="1545"> “It is incredible, but despite everything surfaces of glass, this building is a model project as regards ecology”, Trouborst entrusts. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermics. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Though the mountain of books is below a cloche, the sun illuminates only little time the interior, even the days of good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick beams out of wooden assembled of through compared to the frontage of glass are used as sun visor, intercepting most of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The surrounding air is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The completely automated blinds take care moreover. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic data processing specialist, already went so far as to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, professeure of Chinese traditional medicine, described even Boekenberg like “the finally found heart” of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> There is a few weeks indeed, during the unveiling, each citizen was invited to donate a book resulting from its personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This measurement made it possible to fill the vacuums of the library which was not yet completely furnished (today, it counts 70.000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The rays overflow of all shares. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a library with empty half.” </seg>
<seg id="1559"> “I believe that our invitation created a certain relation between each citizen and this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Each one knows that its book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration.” </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus MVRDV reached the main discipline which one calls, in the professional jargon, “the creation of an identity”. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Even if it can appear young and little educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is finally about a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: “the Germans must play a greater part.” </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany chose the abstention at the time of the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and the EU, this decision put Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinian to obtain the statute of observant State at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But it then chose the abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must show prudence, because it maintains the particular relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support either the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to affirm its independence, without however showing itself too critical towards Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> At the time of the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention at the time of the vote on the installation from a zone of air exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO imposed this measurement. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Does Germany have difficulty of adopting a clear position in connection with the great international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is re-examining its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak definite by the Americans and to found a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans thus encounter several faces. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is waited them until they play a more independent part, but they are not accustomed there. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they still grope to find this role, but are on the way of a foreign politics “more normal”. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What then means concretely the term of foreign politics “normal” for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the will to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to the national files. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign politics is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and his relationships to certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Did these economic interests influence the position of Germany with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention at the time of the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has initially important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> This is why Berlin must take care not to run up against the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is without any doubt a crucial factor. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I would not grant too much importance to it, because it is not about exclusively unilateral relation. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is there in any case a crucial factor in the German strategic reflections. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention at the time of important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> This is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was it in the case of the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even as Germany only will be respected of it. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany thus showed that it must be taken with serious as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are varied. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority from the European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There always were differences because of the scene American domestic policy. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Administration Obama secretly shown a great comprehension towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But considering the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the true differences in opinions are not so large that they always appear it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli the Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing of enthusiasm with regard to the policy of Netanyahou. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does Germany have difficulty of reconciling its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that does not facilitate the things for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot thus be registered within a vaster political line and must affirm their singular position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> It is what they currently do in the question of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will assume a role of engine in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not simple for Germany, in particular because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question was always delicate. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But in my opinion, the Germans are quite conscious owing to the fact that they must play a part which marks their independence more. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Does Germany see itself playing a part of serious actor on the international scene, Germany wants it only to assume one key function? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or does she always have difficulties in assuming leading roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed there, that is always uncomfortable for him and, in obvious reasons, the country always has difficulty of playing a more important part. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If one looks at, for example, the crisis of the euro, one notices that with each time Germany decides to weigh more, of many feelings antiallemands are made hear. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That does not facilitate the things for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: one does not want to be encircled hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> This point seen, Germany is in a position much more delicate than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must compose with neighbors and opinions very varied, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the influence of the United States on the European policy do nothing but decrease, but currently, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then which does it does remain? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will have simply to play a more important part. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if they do not like that, even if that their is unpleasant and if they only are appreciated of it, it is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the assistant editor of Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and experts in policy of Europe and North America analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community together. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also member of German Marshall Fund, where it specialized in German policy, American foreign politics and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> “Protection of the brands” in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Does Armani Sports shirt… of what really act? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name a registered trademark in China is hiding place officially, but which has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand enjoys thus a protection such as the company which is called from there cannot carry felt sorry for. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could it, it is not sure that she would win the case. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> “It is increasingly difficult for the foreigners to protect their brands in China”, explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the cabinet Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the property right in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new file arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators need only some additional letters to be able to record their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, one records Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also made copy in all legality, like Puma, the manufacturer of sports equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a sorter in which the recordings carried out near the office of the brands of Beijing are. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company deposited the brand Zegna DF Puma, a denomination which the firm artificially created by adapting part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of mode. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact which the Chinese became the world champions of the copy and the violation of the intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, one finds shopping centres on several floors which sell practically only counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The cases of Pattloch are however different: its constituents give the responsibility it to attack the fact that the Chinese office of the brands officially confers to the Chinese companies the right to use a denomination which is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak about “Mingpai Bang”, of brand relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from “Dakuan Bang”. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that the women are designated who marry with rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say not to have anything to reproach itself. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> “They is bad for the business, it is necessary to fight against this trend”, requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> “The brand is edulcorated, the singularity disappears, the damage for the reputation are enormous.” </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the legal expenses amount to million for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the expensive featured products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the data of the company of research market CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third worldwide market of luxury items and that which develops most quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to erase the doubtful recordings of the register of the brands and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These last can last up to nine years, and the exit is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch mentions the lawsuits at the time which the court rejected the complaint, because after one long period, the criticized denomination had become a “reality of the market”. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch explains us why if the plaintiff does not have a chance, it can even be obliged to pay money with the plagiarist, because it would have harmed his brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this field, it is sometimes the law of the jungle which dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases relate to also graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine of Sany building site, the same company which had just repurchased the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This is why the Chinese can use an emblem which resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the acquisitor of Volvo, used before a blue logo and white which pointed out that of BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The house of mode Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reorientated the glance of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The office of brands CTMO in Beijing however admits to have known some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the office would have spent last year of a “emergency in the course of work to a found normality”. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of the untreated procedures of opposition would have dropped by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain in suffering with the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the figures are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> The year spent, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests for deposit of brand, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the office, it is about a record and that means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of the new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> That would also be worth for the full number of the legal brands, which is of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the office would have entered 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each recording brought back on average 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle costs much more, like illustrates it the case of the German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Admittedly, the Germans could obtain that the illegal manufacturing of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator could maintain its rights Chinese on the Freudenberg brand. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> “It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany”, explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The office of the brands had thus rejected the objection of the Inhabitants of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg won certainly the case near the two following authorities, but the opposing party continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Vigilance is of setting </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the business is in authority near the Supreme court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is trustful, he believes in a positive exit of the lawsuit and praises the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, he adds: “the procedure is long, testing and much time and money costs us.” </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. The service of the archives has even due to review the hundred last year old acts in order to bring evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain with the opposing party “large summons in euros with six digits” to regulate the litigation. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> “It is with that which one sees what that represents for us”, Wentzler entrusts. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow as far as Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> It would be the case so imitators of this area made sure the exploitation of the not protected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a company of production of shoe and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had for a long time given up this sector, but it had been able nevertheless to prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: “vigilance is of setting”. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advise to him with the German companies to show a greatest caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, according to them, to trust the international law of the brands, the foreigners should rather “also record in China all that is likely to be protected”, like says it Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> If not, the costs can be much more important than those of the recording. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the time of the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay fees of licence with the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains it. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or then, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of fight against AIDS: to type foot, to sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The Imbongi choral society repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland are delighted by their arrival. </seg>

<seg id="1720"> This sum guarantees to the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the center sucker. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means into Zulu “storyteller of stories” or even “singer of praises”. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can usually speak the Bantu language in this area, but all can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Since nearly 10 years, the choral society repeats songs in this foreign language which it brought in Germany for now returning it to her native area: south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because with 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Esitjeni is, the village which depends on the vocal power of the German choral society. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% people reached </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village counts approximately 2.000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or of ground and the majority of them is children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 between them are orphan, because the VIH carried their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni, one can observe with more small scale the evils who overpower Swaziland: the rate of infection with the highest VIH and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to the UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population practically never accepts the male circumcision, a measurement which however guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection of half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrying the virus of the immunodeficiency and it is not rare to die in the middle of about thirty. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> At the time of a travel of group in Africa in spring 2005, the choral society had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children in the street with which it missed not only the parental care, but also quite simply all: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the beginning, they were only some people who personally committed themselves pouring a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to the school and to offer a hot meal per day to him. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But hardly one year later, the choral society founded “Voices for Africa”, an association which is since then occupied in an almost professional way of the orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts in connection with the infections sexually transmissible </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Which are the sexually transmitted diseases most current? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among STI bacterial, one counts syphilis, chlamydiées and the blennorrhoea (or gonorrhoea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> STI current are the VIH, the virus of the human papilloma, the genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The pubic louses and the scale belong to STI parasitic. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Which are the groups mainly concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and the blennorrhoea often appear at the men who have sexual relationships with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert-Koch estimates that the sexual contacts between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilises on five declared in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the adult heterosexuals, the infections related to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidiasis (fungic), the blennorrhoea and the virus of the human papilloma are current sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of propagation of the VIH between adult heterosexuals is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of the new infections with the VIH are observed within this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> In the young people, one observes a rate of infections related to chlamydiées appreciably higher than at the other groups of population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European statements, the three quarters of all the infections relate to the young ages from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, the virus of the human papilloma is current in the young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Which is the evolution amongst infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not obligatory to declare all the sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of the cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: the figure passed from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of the new infections with the VIH falls. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2.700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> That represents a reduction in a tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Which are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can cause abscesses on the level as of genitals, of the urinary pains, the vaginal discharge, the pains to the stomach as well as the appearance of buttons and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they regularly do not involve any pain or another symptom and thus remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect itself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> The condoms can decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect at 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the disease-causing agents of the sexually transmitted diseases can be also transmitted by lubricating infection or close body contacts. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts thus recommend to any person often changing sexual partners to pass regularly from the examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most STI quickly detected can be cured and the late after-effects can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, with the gifts, but especially at the funds which the chorus-singers thanks to their voices collect through whole Germany, the means accumulate. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> “In all, we already sent approximately 200.000 euros to Esitjeni”, Annette Lennartz, president of association specifies. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> At the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a sure woman of oneself and which always obtains what she wants, manages the money coming from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also takes care that the orphans are well placed, at one their grandmothers for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Suckers, thus one calls the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them accommodate to 14 orphans, they offer a roof to them and take care that they go each day per hour to the school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who does not have anybody any more is accommodated in a sure place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by association, just like the two cookers which prepare each day the meals for more than 200 famished children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Moreover, “Voices for Africa” created a school of seam and licence the construction of two hen houses. With the participation of the American organisation for health PSI, association organized a screening test of the VIH for many inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> That does not go from oneself, because even if the disease is quite visible in all the country, it remains a subject taboo. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> “The AIDS is a true taboo”, explains Annette Lennartz, “because it is a subject which touches sexuality.” </seg>
<seg id="1773"> They is rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of the democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These manners sanctioned by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the fast propagation of the VIH observed these last decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant worker also disseminated the virus through the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> One however finds condoms with each corner of street, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh.” </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to support the cultural exchange somewhat, the chorus-singers of Imbongi travelling outfit leave all both or three years in the South Africa and strike up filled up songs of nostalgia, of courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the point of the black continent still know time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with white which sing in African language is a means of recognition such as it generates not only good mood and joy, but tears off sometimes also a tear with some frightening frontier guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus always takes them along to Esitjeni, where the chorus-singers visit their godsons. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a chart, Esitjeni is well-known in the valley of Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> “In Esitjeni, you Go will find light there”, people say over there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a travel 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies, of return to Heidelberg, in front of these chorus-singers who type foot in the room of repetition of Bergheimer Straße, one finds also the light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe brought back evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The layer of ice could reach 20 meters thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> American space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published explain it this Thursday in the specialized magazine “Science”. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe brought back evidence of the existence of a cover of ice in the area of planet permanently plunged in the shade. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres being able to go up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Water probably comes from comets or perhaps from asteroids which would have run up against Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody establishes link between the water discovery and the assumption of a presence of life on planet, explains in chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential components with the life arrived in other areas of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unperceived of the inhabitants of our planet, the probes, the telescopes and the small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Time with other, they send images to the ground, such of the small interstices through which one observes the infinite one. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers of Institut Max-Planck. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cérès. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Comme Pluton, who orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not regarded as a “planet”, according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infra-red photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “portrait of family” of the innumerable generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the “new-born babies” in the room of childbirth of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where are born the stars, baptized “W5”, a name well not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The Spitzer telescope of NASA photographed the blazing glare of a star dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The circle in the fritter shape is composed of elements which the star projects when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In immense Trifide nebula, at 5.400 light-years of the Earth, gas and dust new stars form. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope photographed this room of galactic childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Pleiads, star cluster also called “seven sisters”, can be observed by the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope more emphasizes the colors. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this photo infra-red, the nebula of Propeller, like a red eye, looks at the spectator directly. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is at 700 light-years in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its resemblances to a terrestrial continent were worth the title of North America to him. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the photo normal and the photo infra-red makes it possible to observe a spectacular colour. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the infra-red detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy relates to the creation of the Saturn&apos;s rings. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> A theory is that the rings are the remains of the Saturn moon which disappeared there is 4.5 billion years without leaving traces. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest photographs and clearest that the telescope Hubble took is that of the galaxy of the Swirl. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the colour, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photography published by the European southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, to several thousands of light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word “trifidus” (divided, shared into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The astronomers photographed the first steps of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of the Serpent eater: to 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two galaxies in fusion precipitate one towards the other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The telescope Hubble observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of “southern wheel of fire”. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Nebula is at 1.400 light-years and is made up of grains of dust which are ten to hundred times the smaller than current domestic dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was elaborate starting from the optical and radiographic stereotypes taken by various telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> One can see there the circle made up of the black holes who is to 430 million light-years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists named largest spiral galaxy “GC 1810”. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula the group of the young stars most luminous of our Milky Way is. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The celestial cradle always gives rise to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These star clouds, which are connected by the nebula of the Rivet washer, also permanently create young stars at 5.000 light-years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy with the light rays and opening of a small black hole, there does not exist yet of dust, it is only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The scientists think that it was born the bigbang shortly after, when the universe was mainly made up hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our glance on the universe: principal telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it later one year to observe stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since, the mirrors of the optical telescopes did not cease growing bigger and thanks to them, it was possible to see always further in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> During 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hauls Observatory of the mount Palomar close to San Diego was the largest telescope of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, in the United States, Broad Binocular is Telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors having each one a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias with Palma, in the Canary islands, is immense. The mirror with him only reached a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of Broad Southern African Telescopes in South Africa was segmented in order to save money. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reaches approximately eleven meters all the same. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of the method of construction economic is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which in limit mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also fixed at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its characteristic is due to its great capacity of collection of light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> In spite of a diameter of relatively small mirror, this capacity approaches those of largest reflecting telescopes of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> The scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Any person owner of a computer can help in the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI, or “research of the extraterrestrial intelligence”) by using the computing power of her machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Sight on the southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here Broad Very is Telescopes (“very large telescope”), an installation worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infra-red spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a very large European telescope (Broad European Extremely Telescopes) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its principal mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1.000 elements to mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not be able to take stereotypes before 2018 as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were regarded as largest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They raised two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each one. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration makes it possible to admire it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important images of space come to us from the space telescope Hubble. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24th, 1990, it delivers images of the distant worlds to us. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks extrasolar planets, primarily those which are livable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on February 2nd, 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photograph illustrates the final preparations before the launching of the space telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in space as soon as possible in 2018 on board a rocket ARIANE 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infra-red space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will have in particular the role of finding light projected by first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists think that the Mercury south pole shelters also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because Messenger orbits much more close to the Mercury north pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The data radars indicated since decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launching of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to be orbited around Mercury, the scientists have the certainty now of it. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> Even a museum of longevity there is found. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country, in which one is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> Even a museum of longevity there is found. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country, in which one is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The travel in the Talysh mountains is of a dishevelled romanticism. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> With the turning of the many turnings of the road, the small bus jolts along timbered hills, of torrential rivers and modest farms. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> All is green and fertile, one would believe oneself almost in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the major South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only with a few kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, by the way which large-thing is not known, if it is not that they speak perfectly the Persan one and the Azeri and that they have a very great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The plastronne small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not agree at all with the picturesque landscape of mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The European tourists are rare here, the way since the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is well too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to traverse the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province did not benefit yet from the legendary wealth that the country must with its crude oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is persuaded that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> “Bakou became celebrates in May thanks to the competition of Eurovision, and the next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest people of the world”, explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of the kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> One can discover there the life of approximately eight tens of Talysh of the area which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a monochrome photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here my grandfather, it reached the 120 years age. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> To have still a child at 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the star discussed of the museum is Șirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There does not exist however birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> “It was born in 1805 in this area, it died in 1973”, Fatulayeva specifies. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man would have married three times and it would have had 23 children. At the 136 years age, it would have still designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Would Șirali Müslümov have been mistaken in a few decades by calculating its age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Institute Max-Planck de Rostock, also heard to him of the man at the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> “Surprisingly old people also live in certain areas of China, in Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan”, explains Scholz, “in Sardinia also, there are men who live incredibly old.” </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof because of the inexistence of the documents, not counting there was no civil register. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Each day, glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is nevertheless in fact that people of the area of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Which is thus the reason of longevity in the South of this country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that Talysh have particular genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a question of food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the meals rich in calories of Talysh, which like the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and of which much drinks melted butter glass daily, are good for health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is this the simple lifestyle which preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the area. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which affirms to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wood house, as it is typical to see some in all the area of the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sat on the ground beside a churn, of which she beats the contents indefatigably. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under only one roof, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are for a long time adult. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children also gambol in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, one prepares tea for the guests been used in typical glasses armadus in the shape as belly. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth of Mirzayeva are aligned perfectly, and under its scarf long braids of fair dark hide that his/her son reveals us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always washed my hair with milk, and thus I never lost them and that they kept their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> “I never used shampoo”, Mirzayeva adds. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly retirement is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate what comes from its clean firm: tomatos, potatoes and garden peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Of all my life, I never bought least food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she speaks to us about her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But very improved when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took the orders. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth by an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who however directed his country like a dictator, almost does not know limits as Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> It was with the power until 2003, his Ilham son succeeded to him thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At all events, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva monthly receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount as in euros) for its retirement, a sum which guarantees a good progress of life in the area. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps that the son for a long time greying of Mirzayeva is right: “the elder ones enjoy a great respect in our culture”. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the center of the large family, they are liked, looked after and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Here is a good reason to live more possible for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> “Human rights” omitted in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution reappears in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations reveal the major fracture of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The constitution project based on the charia is violently discussed. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not miserly filled up words of emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must make a success of the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> “And this success is of my responsibility towards the people and God”, he declared on television State. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Its speech was intended to the entire people, but also especially with the Coptic Christians, with the liberals, Muslims enlightened and laic. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all the members of the confused and hopelessly divided opposition are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile with the hands of the powerful Muslim brothers. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi declared, almost while excusing himself, temporarily to have restricted competences of the Constitutional court and to have widened to them his “in order to save the revolution”. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world do not know really what this 61 year old wants to save engineer, holder of a doctorate of the American university of California of the South. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judicial power be reversed? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written with haste by the constituent assembly mainly Islamic of 100 people at the time of fifteen hours a night amazing feat are indeed worrying to a certain extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the project provides that jurisprudence rests on “the principles of the Islamic right”. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what means really the word “principles”? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and that remains always a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the islamist ones use the vague formulation and the legal manoeuvre margin which results from this to apply a more strict interpretation of the charia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case it is which an article lately introduced stipulating gives rise to think that, with regard to all the subjects touching with the charia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the Islamic institution most important of the country and its glare radiates on everyone Islamic Sunnit. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> That can, but does not want inevitably to say that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would de facto involve the setting under supervision of the judicial power. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many items in the constitution project are matter with interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts got busy to repress the opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, to 11.000 civilians were held by the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State also must, one can read in the project, to protect “true nature from the Egyptian family” and “to promote its morals and its values”. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the contents of art cinematography and the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In light, it would be quite simply about censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article expressly guarantees the equality between the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead of that, another prohibited article to offend or defame the Mahomet prophet or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offence nor how it must be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Quite as doubtful is the formulation implying that it is interdict “to offend the people”. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are thus matter with interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, according to its own words, will be “very soon” the object of a referendum near the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> “The revolution reappears” </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is mobilized since weeks against the digital superiority of the islamist ones. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony on the Tahrir place in Cairo, promising to make fall the charia before it comes into effect. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> “The revolution reappears and we will gain”, launches Hamdin Sabbahi, arrived third at the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Prize of the peace and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei declared that the constitution project is “to throw in the dustbins of the history”. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant message service, it showed the partisans of Morsi to want to foment a “putsch against the democracy”. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> “If he proclaims the referendum, one will go to his palate and one will reverse it”, exclaims To gossip Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> “We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not expiated yet”, declared according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Moreover, several judges announced not to want to supervise the referendum, which would involve its nullity. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> “The Koran is our Constitution” </seg>
<seg id="1980"> On her side, the Moslem brotherhood, organized well, called with a counter-demonstration not on the Tahrir place by measure of precaution, but on other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The buckled women and the partisans of the Salafists, which took part in it in great number, stressed: “the people claim the application of the law of God.” </seg>
<seg id="1982"> “Our country Cleans! ”, they asked Morsi, by affirming that “the Koran [was them] Constitution”. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A combat for sovereignty on the symbolic system places Tharir, where all started, would well quickly have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, it is what the partisans of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim brothers declared that the opponents with the constitution project, as well as its partisans, had expressed themselves high and strong. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes of the direction which the country must take. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of islamist will gain certainly the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> “The human rights are not mentioned only once” </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this imposed constitutional process which should have been prolonged until February and include all the social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in front of the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> It did it not because it shared their design of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> This is why it was coiled blows, was considered and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> “And now, the term is not even marked once in the new Constitution”, he regrets during his discussion with Welt amndt Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers discouraged lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measurements are attacks shouting with the rules of the democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> “Instead of reinforcing the civil society, the president removes all his powers de facto to him”, Saeda regrets. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, a democracy cannot function without organizations of the civil society. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels forsaken, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> That could be paid. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A demonstrator on the Tharir place warns: “you are confined of a monster that it will not be possible any more for you to control.” </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most odorous fish of the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who populate Norway profits from one of the more high levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Could the secrecy of the success of the country be related to the appetite of the buildings for an extremely odorous fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take advanced cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty clothing of football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait one week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you obtain the disturbing odor of the rakfisk, one of the most snuffed mets of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, at approximately 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, omnipresent, impregnates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is composed of trout powdered with salt and fermented in water for one length of time - according to the odor which you want that it exhales - which can go up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When the darkness settles and that the weather is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival which takes place here, in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> “You eat raw, then you swallow glass of aquavit”, explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local fireman whom one also calls “General Rakfisk”, responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people avalent of small pieces of fish and thread a great quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> “Certain people prefer the aquavit with the rakfisk”, Havard adds. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the odor. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I test a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it bad - that is not done to think of a sushi which would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk goes back to one time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water barrels tight with the air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once fermented well, the fish left and - without any doubt with the directions reduced by alcohol - ate. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> With the former generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly towards the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now, the population develops quickly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the high wages and a complete health care system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was it does not have so a long time richer there than Norway, cross the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something of important, a vital element, although odorous, past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> That made party of the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But all is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each one. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway often does not make speak about it in the international topicalities, which is not to displease to him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not laid out with speaking about Anders Breivik, the racist extremist of right-hand side which killed 77 people, among which women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they evoke this slaughter, they speak about “the incident of July 22nd”. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have evil to accept that in their peaceful country, one as of theirs could make such a barbarous act. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the beginning as of the Seventies, Norway owes its wealth with its oil industry and gas, one of most important in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> “But oil is not the single reason which justifies our success”, explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and the eyes of a transpiercing blue, the image of the Scandinavian wellness, with a plate of rakfisk to the hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how known as-you - careful people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Its English, as that of the majority of people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discrete, we do not like to point out to us. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway managed its oil wealth with much prudence - all, except for a small percentage of money resulting from this industry, is invested in funds special with the profit of the future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries threw money down the drain, during years which led us to the international financial crisis, Norway knew to keep the quite tight cords of its purse. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> “As long as one can ski in winter and make excursion in summer, we are happy”, Anna specifies. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> “Without forgetting the rakfisk”, she adds in a carefree laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am held upright under snow and I make the tail to buy what to eat - I had my amount of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> With the menu, a hamburger made up of dash, a true discovery, it is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But this evening, the odor of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I remain is one of the many places where one serves as the rakfisk to dine and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for most odorous of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is an emission of TV where the presenter carries a node-butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> One would believe oneself in the competition of Eurovision. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> “Which score you did give to best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?” </seg>
<seg id="2046"> “Here our points, Havard.” </seg>
<seg id="2047"> One hears laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps it is because of fish emanations. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> Whereas entering President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his post in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties which expect it and the expectations of the people, which are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where the congestions are legion in normal weather, a stopping of security has been set up for Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent the people going to their work, but from preventing the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president in charge of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task expects it. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The economy of Mexico goes well, of the results which one owes with outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a war of the drug which already costed the life of approximately 60.000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> “My government undertook towards the Mexican people to reduce violence”, Mr. Pena Nieto with US president Barack Obama in the Oval office declared a little earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new strategy as regards security which will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before mixing with the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populated and tentacular state which encloses the capital. On its ground of predilection, the opinions concerning this new leader are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic commune of Valle LED Cheer, for example, it is registered in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The buildings allot to him the development of tourism and the infrastructures in the commune. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To join the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr. Pena Nieto, an important improvement was brought to these roads, formerly embossed and full with cracks. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates raising its name are hung outside a new sports complex and of an impressive interactive museum dedicated to the climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> “We count on him to set up lasting changes”, declared his/her friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a true change which our country needs so much. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without fault with the power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of the congress Olvera admits that after 12 last years apart from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many waitings within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It rejects criticisms of the opponents who reproach the new president for missing charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is an excellent statesman and, over all, it can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, it is not always the image which people of their former governor have. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, contrast with the paved streets of Valle LED Cheer could not be more obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the overpasses of the motorways, it constitutes, with many regards, suburbs of the town of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the soldiers were called with the rescue to fight against the gangs of drug which prevail in the districts, and the violences made to the women are particularly serious there. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster area, one found, in edge of discharge, the bodies of tens of women assassinated during two last years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1.000 women were killed in the state of Mexico whereas Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the very violent town of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly celebrates for the number of innocent women who were killed there. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it did not succeed in damming up the problem of the murders perpetrated against the women when it was in function. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, they show its administration to refuse to see reality opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated district, Irinea Buendia fights to retain its tears when it shows me photographs of her late daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version mentions a suicide made by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, its family thinks that it was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> “When I arrived to it, it seemed to me that its body had been washed”, Señora Buendia tells. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the rigor mortis was already started. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Whereas his/her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana equips the wall, beside a cross where figure the word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, it is exactly what the family saw itself refusing. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a fautrice of disorder, a crybaby. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want that one accepts what they say and which one keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> “But it is not normal that there are as many irregularities and omissions”, she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families were touched by the crime in Mexico during six last years and the new president made the promise that it would make his priority of it during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> “I hope that it will be as good as a president as when he was governor”, Olvera declared, in Valle LED Cheer, member of the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear more. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain ill-treatments, declare the prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutors try to counter the claims of ill-treatment whose Bradley Manning would have been victim at the time of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The lawsuit relates to the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, to Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Defense wants to classify the business with the reason that the sequestration of Manning was done under extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is shown to have concealed thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The prosecutors tried to show, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- shown to be at the origin of the largest escape of confidential information of all the history of the American army -- missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatments which he claims to have undergone at the time of his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> At the time of a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary audience with Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein affirmed that weekly recordings of visits paid to Manning by officers during its nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaint concerning its treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- during an audience, defense presented a request requiring that the business Manning be classified with the reason which sequestration was made under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire for committing suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This analyst of the military information, decree in June 2010, is shown to have concealed thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the time of the audience of Friday, Fein examined with Manning the forms which the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where it was subjected to a maximum prison insulation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers put questions to Manning and consigned his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein evoked the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that booked its guards to him was “excellent” and that the treatment which it had had within the prison was overall “very professional.” </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not mention any complaint for ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned it about its prison treatment, affirmed Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning answered that it had orally expressed concerns relating to certain problems and that the officers in visit had discussed its concerns and had indicated that they would be occupied some, but they did not consign the mentioned problems. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> “They wrote “any problem” (after having approached concerns), and for as much, that did not mean that I had not raised issues”, Manning declared. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Collar. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a discussion in January 2011 with the special subcommittee which had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning answered that its intention during the meeting was to make amend its restrictive indicating a “risk of wound”. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The soldiers declared that they had assigned this restrictive statute to him -- a level below the monitoring brought closer for risk to suicide -- for its protection and the security of the others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> “I wanted that staff knows that I was well, and I wanted that one withdraws me this statute… in order to profit from a better quality of life from my point of view”, Manning declared. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and of his transfer to Kuwait, where it was held during nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison from the base from the Body from the Marines with Quantico, in Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He stated to have planned to commit suicide when he was to Kuwait and to be themselves disappeared once because of heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact of not being held with the current of what he was going to arrive to him or from what occurred in the rest of the world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> “My world was tiny room to Arafjon Camp, with this cage”, Manning declared, Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought that I was going to die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once in Quantico, Manning declared that it had spent most clearly his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only objects of which it laid out were a mattress, a cover, flip-flops, clothing and its glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> It tried to remain moving, because to sleep or remain lengthened during the day was contrary with the regulation. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also specified that when it tried to sleep, it had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see its face when it was turned over the night, they awoke it in order to be able to see its face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning deposited a formal complaint for the treatments undergone by Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison with Strong Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Friday also, the judge put questions to Manning concerning an allegation reported in his testimony of Thursday -- that after forcebeing forced to sleep naked a whole night in his cell with Quantico, one forced it to be held naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning, during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at any moment, it was allowed to him to be covered with a cover during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning declared that he had deduced about his guard that he was to release his cover which could have hidden its nudity, but he recognized that nobody had ordered to him to release it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that it had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because it would have tried to prove to an officer who he was not a danger to itself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning would have declared with the officer that it could have used the rubber band of his slipway or its flip-flops to be wounded, but that it had not done it. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> This night, Manning testified that its underwear, its flip-flops, and its glasses had been withdrawn from its cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiments that it lived during his detention and that it will reduce his sentence considerably if he were to be recognized guilty before a court-martial, a lawsuit which should be held at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Defense declared that Manning plans to plead guilty the least serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other loads considered to be too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The audience should take again this weekend, with prosecutors who should assert that the detention conditions were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation which governs the detention conditions of all the prisoners with Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The counts of indictment carried against Manning include the flight of goods or public documents, the collusion with the enemy, causing the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of relative information to national defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all the counts of indictment are retained, it incurs the life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexico City-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many was forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans tend to blame those which left; they recall the Mexicans the difficult periods, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that Mexico City-American finds itself taken between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> At the time of a recent travel to Mexico City, while arriving in the hall, owe the immigration and customs authorities, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Panels indicated two ways: for the “Mexicanos” (“Mexican”), another for the “Extranjeros” (“Foreign”). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I remained motionless during several seconds, not knowing towards which file to direct me. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew in the center of California, where me was called the “Mexican” all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is about an ethnic qualifier, as well as that which my friends of Boston use when they are said “Irish”, or my friends of New York when they are said “Italian”. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then, I became “Mexico City-American”. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the ground which saw being born my grandfather, no need for special qualifier nor of hyphen. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, to manage sufficiently well a maintenance in one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of indigenous, and I cannot lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Then I took my American passport and I moved towards the file “Foreigners”. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought of this moment of the week when new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, in the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their topics of predilection are immigration, drug and the trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto also wanted to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons which push the Mexicans to remain in Mexico rather than to risk itself in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> It wishes to be combined in the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto commits itself continuing the war against the cartels of drug in Mexico, although it did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relation with the United States complicated and is filled of bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield in writing half of their territory to the forefront of rifle. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Consequently, as soon as official U.S. formulates the least critic with regard to Mexico, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints on the way in which the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma seek the brawl. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relation is that which the country maintains with the most 35 million Mexico City-Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Do you want that the subject of the bitterness is broached? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is much of it. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and its losers, of the people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer any. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason which explains a large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a given time, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or a grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go in North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And generally, this person corresponded to a standard profile -- a sunk skin, little informed, resulting from a poor village, etc </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are honest towards them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Pas le Mexique. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we currently live dreamed American, that we in good schools and that we have good situations, we went do not have to never lose sight of the fact that it is dreamed American that we live, and not that of the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our honesty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We grant it to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is reciprocal. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We point out a humiliating defeat to them and they measure us as if we were individuals of stock lower and not sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will be never rather good, our bonds with Mexico will be never rather strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not find ourselves not wedged a good side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost hearts. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My woman which was born in Guadalajara and which emigrated legally in the United States whereas it was child, recalls me that there exist frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexico City-Americans, because the Mexicans more firmly assert their identity and the Mexico City-Americans are opposed by it. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is American citizen, it has the feeling to belong to two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> In addition, many Mexico City-Americans whom I know do not have the feeling to belong to a country or other. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We adore the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of the two worlds, but we are rooted in none of both. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, one regards us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, one regards us as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate a little more the relation, as I learned during my stay, certain Mexican leaders and part of intelligentsia want to approach the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want that the Mexico City-Americans work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, by representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country which it is absolutely necessary to visit and put the pressure to the political leaders to reinforce the bonds with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not arrive. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if one considers the inequalities of wages, the corruption and the violence related to drug which are omnipresent, much among us are not persuaded that it is about a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You will have to only clear up you, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> So certain Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way in which they treated Mexico there are one century and half, they must consequently accept that certain Mexico City-Americans are upset with them always way in which the members of their family were treated it does not have there so a long time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps let us be us more “Mexican” that I did not think it. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas are still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Won&apos;t it be able to never have there a durable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While persist in the same futile arguments to know which started, of tens of buildings were reduced in dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most between them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, of the launched rockets of Gaza landed close to Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> Arab spring did everything to fly in glares, and that it or not is wanted, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up with by this regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps that their fight will intensify still a little more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are all the reasons to think that could help them to leave this dead end mortal. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war which makes to no loser nor any winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first sight, it seems difficult to show optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire granted on November 21st is maintained, the combat of this week reinforced the partisans of the force, on the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement which directs Gaza since 2007, will pride themselves to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza wiped a beating. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> To have killed some of its leaders and to have driven back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and over-populated corners of planet, Israel did not succeed in destroying Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas gains ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently to the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas could think that time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of islamist of the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas was made rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power in full rise, formerly the Moslem ally nearest to Israel, took makes and causes for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest states and most dynamic of the Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The members of Hamas are jubilant and say that the Islamist crescent is curved around Israel, from Lebanon, in north, where the militia of the Hezbollah exerts her domination, via Syria, where the rebels with islamist trend can reverse Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim brothers with in the chair the Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far more populated and most central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, this despot who controlled Egypt during 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an actor of importance which could not be excluded any more even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> During this time, the partisans of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas was given out of box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The system of interception of missiles baptized Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and of many missiles of Hamas were destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - during a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and of many European countries reproached Hamas for being at the origin of the last wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But especially, Israel thrived, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the first-minister, who completely was unaware of the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rocket fires of Gaza killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was saved by the attacks suicides, in particular thanks to the barrier of separation which encroaches on the West Bank, the principal piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies which continue to extend in spite of their illegality as regards international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party amalgamated with a party even more warmonger, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election of January 22nd, has the beautiful part. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why pamper these rotten Palestinian in their giving a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they directed the West Bank, wouldn&apos;t they launch of the rockets, as their compatriots did it in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and to strike them as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps that the partisans of the line lasts will carry it; but it may be that Arab spring changes gives it. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the islamist ones which takes the power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to attack the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four brought together Arab neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> To begin a war with the local super power will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a cease-fire what is of good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think in the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the Arab rest of the world which becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create an explosives magazine which is dedicated to explode one day in the occupied territories by Israel - a little like the bus which exploded in Tel-Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression weakens already the democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza all both or three years to sound Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be thorough by those of outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains that preached by the reasonable people whom one finds on each side, and by most external world and this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in return for the security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and short-term, is that the cease-fire will give the opportunity to the external people to defend this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now harness itself to put an end to the circulation of weapons towards Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is placed better than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with exchanges of shared ground and a Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs of the external countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah so that they are linked. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would contribute much more to creation of a Palestinian state that the nearest proposal for a pseudonym state with UNO. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has any interest so that Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During its first mandate, it did not present its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Of return to the White House, it seems quite as reticent to establish one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a very skimped vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> That makes by a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws for neutral cigarette packs are comings into effect in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and sick photographs of bodies recover the green packages dark which all are identical, whatever the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This law coming into effect in Australia is first world, the logos and the colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photographs of sick bodies and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by the tobacco addiction of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the various photographs and medical warnings, the only difference between the packages, for this Saturday, has been the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the most strict mode in the world as regards packing of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government declared that the objective was to dissuade the young people to smoke by removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies showed that if the people did not start to smoke before the 26 years age, there is 99% of chances that they never start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> “Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by the manufacturers of tobacco through their brand image”, the Federal Minister for health declared, Tanya Plibersek, by quoting studies which revealed for example that the children associated the crown of a logo to a princess.” </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Even if Australia records more the low level of tobacco addiction in the world and if these changes have only little impact on the benefit of the multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry put pressure against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The manufacturers of tobacco declared that would start again the trade of the black-market, which will more easily give access to less expensive cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> “Fatal consequences will rise from this legislation”, Scott McIntyre declared, of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The forgers of China and Indonesia will sell much more cigarettes of counterfeit in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others declared that this law had instigated their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha de Zico Importation Pty Ltd, a family small company, declared that the request for cases with cigarettes, in particular out of silicone to mask horrible packing, strongly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain&apos; S Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco disputed the law and lost before the high court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha declared that Zico sold 6.000 of them to wholesalers and is on standby of renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, the business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only trouble, say the experts, is the popularity of the social media and the slice of population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting the advertisements with the TV, sporting sponsoring and the obligation for the dealers to dissimulate the cigarettes, the marketing of the tobacco is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia prohibited publicity on the Web by the local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent the foreign sites from making some. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> “If you work in the marketing of the tobacco and that you do not lay out any more that of a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place impossible to circumvent par excellence”, declared Becky Freeman, enquiring in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noticed an increase in the contributions of certain average citizens in favour as of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Do we have to wonder whether it is about an ordinary citizen who adores the Marlboro cigarettes and which tried hard to make a video, or if it is about a campaign marketing orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia declared that industry concentrates on the new regulation into force rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Industry went until paying the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute these new legal decisions - these countries declared with WHO that the trade is wrongfully handicapped, although none of these countries had important commercial exchanges with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A decision of WTO should be taken during the course of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek declared that the government had held of the discussions with other countries concerning of the similar laws on packing. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make compulsory the photographs of warning on packing in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, of which Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More severe laws are currently under investigation in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photographs. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photographs do not disturb me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I am unaware of them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> “You take a cigarette and you arrange the package”, declared Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package on which figure a photograph of tumour of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason which will make me stop, it is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack tobacconist” in the center of Sydney, declared that the uniformity of packing made difficult the storage of the packages on the displays. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> “Front, it took me one hour to discharge a parcel, now, it takes me four hours” declared Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> “The government had only once and for all to prohibit them and we would have said OK, they are good, one stops and one puts the key under the door”, he added, while raising the arms with the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it can be good to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport for the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to expect the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Consequently, I had sufficient time to think of the topic of the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> To spend one half-day in an airport to expect a flight is rather tedious, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the shops of duty-free). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more, certain academics and experts specialized in the development of the child speak in praise of the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> That forces the brain to take interesting ways, to even nourish the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the majority, constantly in front of several types of screens, we do not know any more the benefits of the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Then should we accommodate the trouble with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will return there. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, following the example of much of people, I thought that the trouble was a rather recent phenomenon, in particular since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But it is not the case, declares Peter Toohey, professor of history gréco-Roman at the University of Calgary, with Canada, and author of “Boredom: In Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> “The trouble goes back to very far”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompéi are reproduced of the Latin graffiti which evoke the trouble, they go back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then, there is the definition which we give to the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it was defined, and discussed, in various ways, declared John D. Eastwood, qualified schoolteacher of psychology in York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After having traversed many publications and subjected the idea to a newsgroup of approximately 100 people, Professeur Eastwood and his colleagues defined the trouble as being an experiment which consists in “wanting to do something, but without managing to launch out in a satisfactory activity.” </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the trouble from apathy, he says, it is that the person is not undertaking a task although she would wish it. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, it does not want there to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is in the middle of the trouble, he declared, it is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a gloomy mood and the feeling which time passes slowly.” </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The trouble can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professeur Eastwood declared that if both can be dependent, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, it sometimes happens to us to think that we are bored whereas it acts by way of a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Within the framework of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention”, which was published in the newspaper “Prospects one Psychological Science” in September, Professeur Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which the participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading an article of magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Certain groups heard, coming from the room at side, the too high sound of an emission of TV which did not have any report, others just heard the emission of TV, and the third group did not hear at all bandage it. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those which heard the TV on a low noise level said that they had been bored more than the two other groups - they had evil to concentrate, but did not know why, and allotted this problem of concentration to the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate you on a difficult or fascinating task, an interruption of the attention can lead to the trouble, declared Mark J. Fenske, a qualified schoolteacher of neuroscience in University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you carry out a tedious task, “like looking at objects on an assembly line, the music can help you not to annoy you.” </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, now, we know that when one twists oneself or that one scribbles, these gestures, often considered as signs of trouble, are in fact a good means of remaining physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> “Studies showed that the children who are authorized to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those which are forced to remain without moving”, Professeur Fenske declared. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We are bored a whole day or the other - the delay of my flight of plane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly tedious film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But certain people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure that, of the researchers developed a “Scale of predisposition to the trouble” in the Eighties. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes assertions like, “Among the tasks which I carry out, much of them are repetitive and monotonous”, and “I have centers of interest so much that I do not have time to do everything.” </seg>
<seg id="2335"> By using such a scale, the researchers discovered that the boys tend to be bored more often than the girls, declared Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology in University of West Florida, and need in particular many and varied stimulations. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, the teenagers are quickly blasé. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor under development individual and Community in University of Illinois, undertook an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via one to beep. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> It raised that 32 percent of the teenagers stated to be bored at the school and during their duties at the house, while 23 percent stated to be bored when they were not at the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents stated to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson declared that it did not know if the percentages of trouble of today, is 21 years later, would be raised or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that “adolescence is one period when the trouble reaches its more high level”, in particular because the children and the teenagers do not have much control on what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I rest my question: is the trouble good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, that can involve the people to take absurd physical chances, to make bets or to misuse certain substances to spend the time, as the studies show it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, of many philosophers and writers evoke a bond between the trouble and the creativity, declared the Professeur Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> “The trouble is the means which the brain found to state to you that you should make another thing”, declared Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology to the N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain always does not know which is the thing most adapted to make. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and that you use this energy to play of the guitar and to cook, that will return to you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, that will return to you happy in the short run, but not in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Then if your child is bored and that you give him a iPad, it will not be bored any more, but it will not have learned how to be occupied all alone nor with autorégler, declares professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And “this autorèglement passes from a situation to another”, he declares. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child does not only learn how to divert himself, it obtains more control of itself in other fields. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we should glorify the trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just like I do not think either that we should criticize it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> To feel at ease apart from the constant boiling that generate the activities and technology is the objective towards which should tend to us. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood is of agreement on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> “We need to more often annoy us, but the trouble wakes up an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something which has direction”, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, which people search, it is a means of disconnecting and of appreciating the downtimes. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> “In an environment where we constantly are hyperstimulés”, he added, “it is difficult to find ways of launching out in something when the noise stops.” </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, any directive for the new law on the marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years, studying in a university and football player in Colorado, is accused for something which will become soon legal in its state: possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco declared that one day, in September, him and some friends were on board a Lamar car, in the middle of the fields, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to appear for drug possession and equipment which can be used with his consumption - minor offences, each one being accompanied by a fine of 100 $ - and a date as appearance. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> “We are treated like criminals”, Mr. Orozco declared. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty which followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of modest amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the answer given to hundreds of business implying a weak use of drugs depends more of the place than of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences implying the use of marijuana were classified without continuation. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police services ceased accusing of the 21 year old adults and more minor possession of marijuana, because the law will into effect come the weeks to come. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who are in the more preserving districts of Colorado invited to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to accuse the people who have some. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> In parallel, several cities of the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West currently vote to prevent the opening of trade of sale of marijuana approved by the State in their districts. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> “The things evolve so quickly that I know what the future books to us”, Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police of Aurora declared, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The organizations of regulation of the State of Washington have also not bad doubts. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are in search of directives on the way of installing a system of licence, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1st, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, that it or not is wanted, is in advance on most states as regards regulation on the marijuana, first of all concerning the use with the fine therapeutic ones and maintaining with regard to the personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> “Colorado has a market more regulated, and constitutes a good indicator”, declared Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place nor system, recognizes Mr. Smith, cannot make more than suggest what functions. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> “There is not a real precedent on which we could base ourselves, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which leaves one year a gap in the law, during which the system of licence will still not exist, whereas the possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> During this time, practical matters remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees an access appropriate to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of trade of sale of cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playing field or a crib. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> “It will not take place there more difficult than urban areas to install an approved trade of sale of cannabis, in particular in the metropolitan zone of Seattle”, Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Center of legalization of the cannabis declared, a group of research recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21st, the chief of the police, Oates, in Aurora, sent e-mail to his officers announcing that the “City attorney” (representative of the Public Ministry) would not continue any more people the 21 year old and more which has modest amounts of marijuana, and which the police was to cease accusing of the people for this kind of offence “for immediate purpose.” </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief Oates declared that the police would apply the new legal decisions which regulate the activity of those which cultivate the marijuana at medical ends, and which it would continue to continue the drug traffickers and the dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the “district attorney” (Public prosecutor), Ken Buck, incarnates a more strict vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with the business of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users so that they are made detoxicate. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but much of them are the object of other inculpations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> “Our office has the obligation to bring continuations against these people who made an offence which, at the time as of facts, was a recognized infringement”, Mr. Buck declared. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative in favour of the restricted consumption of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police with Large Junction, more the big city of the county, does not make any more appear of adults for possession of restricted quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the Public Ministry of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify without continuation all the business of detention of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> “I do not have the impression to waste my time to continue to apply the law until it changes”, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 per hundred of the voters of Colorado supported measurement, to offer a legal framework and governmental appropriate to the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy matter to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions which were observed in various American cities highlight deep ambivalence among the official buildings with regard to the legalization of the marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> “It is about a cultural barrier” with the representatives of the Public Ministry, declared Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver which represents the marked people of consumption of marijuana and which is expressed as a local spokesperson of the “National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws” (National organization for the reform of the laws on the marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> “They passed a good part of their life to be prosecuted of the people who consumed marijuana, as, they have evil to accept as it is legal”, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana with the same level as that of alcohol, the Colorado and the state of Washington are about to becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Whereas the defenders and of the representatives of the State envisage a new border of legalized sales, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which always conceives the sale and the culture of marijuana like federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana hope that the Ministry for Justice will yield. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> In spite of certain popularized through the media arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and salesmen, the federal government especially allowed the trade of sale of marijuana to the fine therapeutic ones to exert in Colorado, in Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police probably will not insert the doors to seize small sachets of drugs, there is extremely to bet that she is opposed to the approved trade of sale of marijuana with personal use authorized by the new laws, declared Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor of the administration Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities of Colorado did not wait until the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Well before the votes, certain local governments approved moratoriums concerning the creation of the new trade of sale of marijuana, even if it is only about one carryforward one year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a 6 months moratorium, and should impose this prohibition the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> “We do not want to find us in a situation where a licence is granted to somebody and then to find us confronted with a federal problem”, declared Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions are posed. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford, because I was a “Tory” (preserving). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> They are not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Also far I remember, I always dreamed to enter to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of the civilisation, the freethinking and the tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks after me to be installed in Worcester College at the end of the Eighties to study the history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father crumbled and started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were disconcerted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of Standard Evening claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relationships in the room beside the mienne. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Author A. NR. Wilson declared with joke that I had left after being forced to drink in notched cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because I had been victim of intimidations and is the object of constant victimizations. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of fact that I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for only one and single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was victim of a racist and barbarian behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, one was advised very influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was well-wisher of the Conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why evoke that today, you will tell me. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> And well, of the recent studies revealed that a new generation of students of centre-droite undergoes the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Increasing and institutionalized hatred students Tory in Oxford east such as last week, some of them required a protection of their rights, as well as those of the gays, the handicapped people and the ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The preserving members of the room of students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College declared that they “were often insulated, attacked personally and felt undesirable” because of their political opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university for the equal opportunity so that their opinions can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary one diffused on BBC Two “Wonderland: Young, Bright and one the Right” (“country of the wonders: Young people, Intelligent and of Right-hand side”), devoted to the policy in the students, and which depicted the “Tories” like eccentrics and the neo-Nazi ones. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> One discovered there in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of “Conservative Oxford University Association (OUCA)”, which moves in Rolls-Royce, raises complete silver plated and moves with a cane with chrome head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, the preserving students say being treated like scapegoats of the installation of the increase in the school fees.” </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of “Conservative Nottingham University Association”, declared with a Sunday newspaper “that there is a bias of left growing in the universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think that we are like Bullingdon Club without same to have met to us.” </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years, studying in history in the Corpus Christi, which proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of the OUCA, known as that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR with regard to the people who are of centre-droite. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> “That constitutes an obstacle with the freedom of the intellectual debates, like with the wellness of the members”, she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think of the kind during my first past weeks in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and of a paralysing timidity. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher - old student - an honorary title, because of the reduction of the financing of the higher learning. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was in charge of Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> As of the first days of the week of reception, when the new students made knowledge with the others and the professors, I had a first impression what thereafter was going to do without. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors not only took part in the sarcastic remarks towards the students Tory, but that moreover, they took pleasure there. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was like if the policy about the minor strikers, of privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcastic remark of which I was victim related to a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> “Miss Wyatt”, professor Harry Pitt said (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph” </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost foot. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man with the pustuleux face, carried himself easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> “Thatchéristes do refuse to learn French or it is just stupid?” he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears burned me the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> “I you suggest taking French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too occupied making you friends”, he launched an aggressive tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I am turned over in my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> During dining it there this evening, I am base alone then I felt a light slap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was student in second year of English studies, named James, who was presented in the form of a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> “I know who you are”, he said, nicely. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid well that it is thus. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Any person suspected of being a Tory (preserving) is taken for target. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is hard already enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, that will be thus even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most young Tories claim to be Ploughing (members of the Labour Party). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, with the local pub, I loosely tried to hide me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted on the fact that I was not agreement with all that Mrs. Thatcher had said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This stratagem failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of philosophy, political sciences and economic which, ironically, had studied in Eton, said: “You are the girl of a fascistic pig.” </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took again the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> “How Tories make love?” asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They strike the ones the others, isn&apos;t this?” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like the homosexual ones before the liberal legislation of the Sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could I only have led a normal life to Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after fallen the night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Ploughing and disavow my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years to come were going to resemble a purgatory of ostracism and insulation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> Only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, which taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was preserving, but also because he was to advise in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this provincial and unimportant place, like his adhesion from the point of view of Marxist-determinist of the history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, it accepted a post of professor at the university of Bilkent, in Ankara, in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> “You will not be happy here”, it said me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge near my family and of my more open town friends of spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I said to my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> It was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During its studies in Oxford, in the Forties, all the political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> “But it is the best place in the world”, it said me pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not do that, not in the city with the bell-towers dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> It had the tears with the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Leave them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that is to tease you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> That would break me the heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance gradually worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a working session directed the following week, when another professor of history suggested most seriously of the world, that I was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do as much of it. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Reddening internally of shame, I admitted to be victim of the washing of brain of my parents and treated them of “insane old men”. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was of short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father who inserted the last nail of my coffin oxfordien. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I remained tapie in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors gave up. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed my bag and I took the first train for London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I am never gone back there. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me softy pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18 year old child should be victim of such an intimidation in a school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> More tragic is that it was about Oxford, which not only has product 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also profits from a steadfast reputation from equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> “Valentino prefers elegance with notoriety” </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Within the framework of the exposure “Valentino: a Master of the Seam”, inaugurated this week in London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian dressmaker. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the old residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the worthy British capital to accommodate an exposure on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The dressmaker recognized it during the unveiling of “Valentino: a Master of the Seam”, a prestigious retrospective which joins together more than 130 models of haute couture created for its designers house during 50 last years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> “I adore this palate”, he declared with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exposure is the point of organ of a history whose only protagonist is “it signore” Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino was always fascinated by the closed world and except for nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exposure, open until March 3rd, one finds a number impressing of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, via the princess Marie-Chantal de Grèce and Margaret d&apos;Angleterre. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino exposes its personal memories like the trophies of its social rise: of the modest dressmaker of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, with the idol of the international jet set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing evil to like the royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> “At least, they do not crush their cigarette ends of cigarettes on your splendid carpet as certain stars of the pop music do it”, the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza declares. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the Sixties and Seventies, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> “We adored all being invited in its country cottage of Gstaad”, explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino always preferred elegance with notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And even thus, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, carrying a Valentino model </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The mannequin Argentina, Valeria Mazza, did not forget the charisma of the dressmaker either. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a procession on the Place from Spain, in Rome, we went to dine with his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were about twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> One saw and felt his spirit in each detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, the music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> “With him, each guest felt important and appreciated”, remembers to it “top model”, which started to work with him lasting the week of the High-Seam in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> “It will never pass from mode, because its creations are works of art”, she finishes. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Procession of line of nobility </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of loves not shared. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves quite high people and with the largest titles and them like it too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium sixty meters broad glamour which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must ravel on the podium to admire a “public” of dreamed creating principal Valentino, as the tailor whom Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristote Onassis had chosen, the costume which Monica Vitti in “Notte carried”, or a coat out of wool and fur having belonged to the empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among this public of mannequins, one finds names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvège, Rosario de Bulgarie or Sophie de Habsbourg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the dressmaker in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of its customers say that the first Valentino clothing is like the first love, “impossible to forget”. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember some perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat “gillette” and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> “It is a present which he had given me”, declared Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the dressmaker. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> “I prefer it with all the others for his femininity, his great love of the women, and because it sublimates our beauty”, the ex-duchess of Fair adds. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like much the colors that it uses, they am luminous and light the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos; Arenberg cannot, it either, to forget the first time that it carried a Valentino model. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When it was teenager and lived in Italy, it dreamed to have the age and the opportunity of carrying one of its evening gowns… </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, that was possible at the end of the Nineties. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in the castle of my cousin, prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red evening gown, with a flounced skirt, a draped long-line bra and a low neckline to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> “It one was dreamed become reality”, the widow of Rodrigue d&apos;Arenberg declared. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> “Valentino is indifferent to the mode, it is obsessed by the timeless one”, explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The princess of Arenberg preserves the evening gowns of the dressmaker with “the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only one dress, it is also the whole of the memories which it conveys”. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The “king” of the mode </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The large final one of the exposure of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller carried at the time of his marriage with Paul de Grèce in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (the dressmaker calls its dressmakers thus) to produce this silk dress ivory with incrustations of pearls, twelve kinds of laces different and a drag from four meters and half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, “the return of the customers of the high society”. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obnubilated during years by the “knowledge-being” of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representing. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander about Arts and of the Letters, decorated with the Legion with Honor, Garavani cumulates as many honors as any husband of its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> “Its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect aspect always jumped me to the eyes”, recognizes of Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time that I saw it, it was one month ago with a dinner of official reception to the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He had sat with the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my large friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> “It was impeccable, the years do not have any effect on him”. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess who says it… </seg>

<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom work is a hell and others which work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn a living while carrying the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It must work each until the underground of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from the entrails of the ground is solidified in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After having collected large sulphur rocks, which weigh on the whole nearly 70 kilos, it installs them in two shopping carts in bamboo which it charges on its shoulders through the steep paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano which culminates with 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, with a pace of tortoise, by keeping balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the chasm. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a false step could cost them the life, as that arrived to a French tourist who fell a deadly fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The minors of Kawah Ijen gain 5 centimes of euro for each kilo of extracted sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once in top, it frayent a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were animals of circus, and carrying the heavy shopping carts painfully, they go the 3 kilometers to the balance which a mining company installed a little downwards with 1.850 meters of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about Pt Candi Ngrimbi, a company which exploits the volcano since 1960 and, one can say it, its employees, with whom he pays 662 rupees Indonesian (5 centimes of euro) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells it with 10.000 rupees (83 centimes of euro) with petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to bleach sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> “As we transport approximately 70 kilos, we gain approximately 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) with each travel”, explains us Anto, which makes three journeys per day in general. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Each one takes 3 hours to him and it finishes exhausted, but that enables him to gain 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although that appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple of what it would gain in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> “The income of the minors is very here high, where the harvest of the coffee is paid 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the monthly average wages are of two million rupees (167 euros)”, the carrier declares which worked formerly as mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Over there, its wages were of 75.000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not also difficult, but Anto returned close to its family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulphur: “I married an young girl of Bali, where they are hindouists, and I brought back it to Java so that it converts with Islam”. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by poison gazs. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At 27 years, it passed three of its life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen, but sulphur already started to make him pay the invoice although it covers the face with a mask and wears special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by poison gazs rejected by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price which it must pay to continue its dreamed. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> “I will work two more years, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French” promises he in English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Abused by the life, this nice and intelligent young person could be tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of that, it does the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares an unhealthy wood hovel with other carriers, is lifted each day to a height of two hours of the morning because sulphur does not cease spouting out the night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the darkness, Anto goes down in the crater in lighting with a small lamp fixed at its helmet, which it bought itself with its own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 carriers load the shopping carts with sulphur on their shoulders since the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> In spite of its comfortable benefit, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of sulphur to save the costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers which work on their account and are paid with the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Moreover, they do not touch either under 30.000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, besides the entry of 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park invoice with the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> “This work is made for the animals, not for the human ones”, protests Madrusin, a corpulent carrier 42 years which has worked in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since it left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to carry up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not stop working “as long as it will be able it”, because it needs money to raise his 3 sons, old between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke which leave the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer from the serious diseases… to which are added obviously their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritides, pains in the knees and the shoulders, deformed by the weight of the shopping carts. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> By balancing the shopping cart on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Each day, its companions and extract 15 tons to him from sulphur of the volcano, that three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 kilometers from there by a path of goats invaded by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> “I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life”, Unainik affirms by opening the mouth well, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The elder one of his/her five children, 30 years old, also works like sulphur carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but misery from generation to generation perpetuates one of the most difficult trades in the world: that which the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen do. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore searches babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singaporeans throw the responsibility for this absence of children on the career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> “The population of Singapore must develop”. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fill our civic duty and give the life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It can appear incredible that these words come from a publicity for pastilles to mint, but in spite of that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video was spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a group of rap which uses local references as “will put Punchinello in the drawer” to make fun of the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hope to draw attention to the problem in a way amusing thanks to this publicity. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, declared that it wished to use the power of the music so that people fill “their national duty”. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended only for the Internet, we thus could return it diverting and amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the principal problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the field of the birthrate, thus we felt that it was a topic that we must approach. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to the phéromones or organizing evenings of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative but they inevitably did not function. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We thus said ourselves the following thing: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make a song of rap of it? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore does not take it as much with the light one. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends 1.300 US dollars a year in policies to encourage his citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measurement of the government in favour as of marriages and the fathers grants to 15.000 dollars per child, lengthens the maternity leave and distributes pre-tax profits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all that had few effects. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is city-state rich and of high technology of the South-east of Asia, such a known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time that it was above 2, regarded as the it, renewal rate was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why thus the Singaporeans have don&apos;t more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of the marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, affirms that it is due to a “better education” and with “a broader choice of career appropriatenesses”. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> “That made it possible to people to have a broader range of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, beyond the marriage and of the constitution of a family”, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of the social norms contributed to the increase amongst single people and to delay the marriage and the births, which has as a result a reduction in birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy aiming at radically increasing immigration to counter the reduction in the population created a resentment within the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, one finds Web sites who abounds a xenophobia hardly disguised against the new immigrants, in particular towards the Chinese who are shown to draw the wages to the bottom and not to be integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore knew last year its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the installation of quotas and higher taxes for the foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unhoped-for consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Whereas the fall of birth rate has effects known on the economic growth of a country, the tax incomes, the medical costs and the immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, that started to affect the real sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of the urban development started to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of “box with shoes”, being able to be built in given zones of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and their sale gains much success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are worried by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single person and discourage the promoters wishing to build large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive officer of real estate company EL Developers, affirms that its “boxes with shoes” are sold much more quickly than the larger residences. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the direction where these residences are built much more quickly than those of bigger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to the promoters, with which one put before sticks in the wheels if they wished to propose too many small residences in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If as well is as these new regulations can be a step towards the increase in national birth rate, while discussing with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effects. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> “People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, therefore people gives it to later”, a junior manager declares. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> “But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and of my time”, another young person of about twenty years declares us. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The men and the women mention their career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property and education like the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it is a question of making babies, they are the Singaporeans themselves which have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private off line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> In accordance with the Dictionary of the Academy Royale Espagnole, it is quality the private field or “the private field of the life which we can protect from any intrusion”. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What comes under the field deprived for less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in the daily life and on the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Does it understand the dangers to which it is exposed while diffusing on Internet of the events that it would certainly not share off line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, old between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the fabric. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they associated the term “something of very personal” on the personal plan and “the password and user name” when they applied it to the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> “I will not reveal my most personal secrecies in a post”, Jorge, ten years affirms, when it tries to explain the significance of the term deprived on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has had an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> “They are very secret secrecies, my mother can know them but not everyone”, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On BFR, I post nice images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discuss with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> “I will not share one of my photographs or somebody which would make the imbecile”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The young boy recognizes that it is badly to publish obscene photographs, stripped people, crimes or to write humiliating comments or violent one. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on BFR like his nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His/her mother in fact part, it knows the password of the one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> “I do not know if they answer me, I post them simply”, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> “The social networks are amusing, I can speak with distant parents or with my friends, in a fast way”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He affirms that he would never accept the request of an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He will not trust either somebody who would recommend a foreigner to him. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, it admits not to know 20 of the people registered on her list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> “That does not worry me because we have something in common, music for example”, he declares. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the young boy, nobody made him advances nor did not ask him his address or for his phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> “If they put the pressure to me or required it, I would remove them simply my account”, he recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose subscribed in Ask after having read a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiments which one knows today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A close relation of one of my friends was racketeered on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened it and required money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> “It never knew which it was” ensures it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, did not close its account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> “It only passed it in private profile”. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He explains us then a series of handling to configure his account in a sure way. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photographs of knowledge in situations uncomfortable or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would make it if I were annoyed or irritated. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> “Even if I know that it is cyberstalking”, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, professor of English and laid off in Education and Training, considers that, to direct the children and the teenagers, one must understand that the goal of the social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> “The Internet has emerges like a means of seeking information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed”, she mentions. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras announces that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master degree in pedagogy of the university of Yale and author of the book “digital Natives and immigrants”, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, it is them, the children and the young people who were born with technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> “Us, we are the digital immigrants who must teach to them there, whereas we are ourselves learning”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> It adds that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what it is or not advisable to reveal, to publish or say in an age where they do not have maturity necessary to do it”. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> “We also let us ask them to be selective whereas what imports to them more is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences” she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective manner to teach the confidentiality with the children and the teenagers is to use questions which make them reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> “To tell Them not to do it is not used for nothing”, she affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras enumerates some examples: are there things which you would not tell with a foreigner, why do do it you on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, that you would it like that they publish a photograph of you as that of a friend whom you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you do you identify photographs of festivals, requests to the other people the permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone does it need to know what you do at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to render comprehensible to them that they must act online as they do it off line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> “Out of the Internet, each one must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be similar on the social networks”, she affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary education teacher and advisor of education, declare that it is essential that the parents conscientiously read the conditions of use of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By including each term, they will have strong foundations to discuss with their children the implications the opening an account on Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> “For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is essential to recall the children whom one should not speak the abroads. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The top of Unasur finished without the Declaration of Lima being made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The Life presidential top of the Union of the South American nations (Unasur) finished today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima being made public, although she was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe tried on several occasions to reach the document signed at the time of the Ordinary Life Réunion of the Heads of States and government of Unasur, but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the presidency announced at the beginning that it would be revealed after the top closure, then affirmed that it would be published from one moment to another on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were questioned on the text, they announced that its contents had been reported on the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, at the time of short declarations to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of the journalists to information concerning the top was constantly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message “session private, audio restricted” was diffused in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little of information which circulated between the journalists was those given by the press agents of some of the governments of Unasur who assisted with go, except for Peruvian spokesperson. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The single document revealed at the time of the day was the list of the presidents present, which caused a certain discomfort at the hundreds of journalists of various national mediums and international which claimed more important information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the top, but it was the speech of president Humala and not of the official document which concluded the top. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd America top of the Arab South-Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although that was required with authority by the press, he had not diffused either the declaration called also Declaration of Lima, as that had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official site of the ASPA, one can check that the document was published in the month of last March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both go international, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up sure systems of transmission for all the journalists, but they limited to the maximum obtaining of information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The top was also concluded with the joint agreement from Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Court of The Hague which slices different frontier between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the time of the appointment regional and stated that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the pleas of the two parts in the lawsuit that Lima brought against Santiago and who starts Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> “We will respect and carry out the verdict which will solve the disagreements that we carry today before this international court”, president Humala stated, at the side of his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> “Chile always was, and will continue to be a respectful country of the international law, peaceful resolution of the controversies, treaties and international courts”, president Piñera added by giving a handful of hand to president Humala, beside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents whom they would subject to the CIJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to be subjected to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously erroneous. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The top was taken place without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended of Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in go. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The president host, Ollanta Humala, were charged to open the deliberations the morning and to close the top shortly after midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been fixed between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the adopted agreements, it mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set up “important approachs to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship by the development of agreements on the residence permits”. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It informed that actions would be installation to improve the “co-operation in the fight against the urban insecurity and the international organized crime, of the actions for a better accessibility with the drugs, the access to the Internet at low prices in the totality of South America, and to evaluate in a joint and effective way the risks of natural disasters”. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of the Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalist person but must help to increase our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our populations”, president Humala concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> “We decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects which improve the connection of spaces of South America, in particular in the rural areas and frontier… by linking our countries and by generating new economic channels”, the president Peruvian at the time of a speech stated. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, it mentioned that five related to Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not give fuller details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> In the same way, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> “We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its rehabilitation within the Union of the South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need which the Latin America remains an area of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relationships with its neighbors, is another topic approached at the time of the top. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this direction, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before beginning to it appointment regional, which he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, saturdays following to Mexico City to discuss the maritime disagreement calmly through judgement of the CIJ requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> “It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I hold a meeting with president Daniel Ortega”, declared president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> “We will revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require to have a discussion with this country”, he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> “I hope to be able to say to president Ortega whom we will regulate that in the possible most civilized and respectful way”, president Santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they envisaged to attend the catch to be able of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Same manner, within the framework of the top, the Ministers for the Defense of the block will meet beforehand to approve the Action plan of the year 2013, which tries to reinforce the dialogue and the consensus in terms of defense in the area. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although this last country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru takes the presidency pro tempore regional block. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> “South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship”, Rafael Correa declares. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which “South America, in this case, was to take as a model Europe”. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who took part in the Life top of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), located at Lima, declared on television State, TV Péru, that Europeans “had to kill each other at the time of the Second World War” and of other conflicts, “but which they formed now almost a fatherland”. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this direction, it defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> “It is necessary to arrive at freedom of movement of the citizens and the workers in any South American country, as it is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there remain still fields reactionaries which we want to make belong to the past” it informed. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Moreover, the Ecuadorian president showed himself in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of the American States (OAS) with the objective to decrease the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account the signatories of the pact of San José on the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those which reshuffle us the ears never do not compromise anything, contrary, us, the South American ones, all signed it. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> “It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of the human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States”, he affirmed, by alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he did not betray itself his principles, but he on the contrary respected his “deep democratic values and of the human rights”. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that at the time, “there were founded suspicions according to which Assange would be extradited towards a third country and that its lawsuit would not be respected”. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Moreover, he criticizes the Swedish justice which required that he subject himself on his territory to a interrogation concerning a sexual offence supposed whereas “the proper Swedish legislation makes it possible to do it by videoconference, which could be done since the embassy from Ecuador in London”. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa affirmed that there was a risk that the mental health and physical of Assange worsens. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> “I did not speak to him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had pulmonary small problems, but nothing low register”, affirmed the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that its physical and mental health worsens by the fact of being locked up in a small space without being able to do exercises with the free air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> “That acts on the health of no matter whom”, he concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa announces that solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in embassy Ecuadorian of London, which would be the attribution of a safe conduct which would enable him to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European legal authorities and it stresses that it had discussions in London in order to find a solution with the seclusion of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with the human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were permanent discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> “The solution with this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched a whole series of procedures near various European authorities”, he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thinks that “if Great Britain granted the safe conduct as of tomorrow, that would finish”. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as its legislation allows it completely, and as it already did in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the embassy from Ecuador to London, or questioned it via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be also solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa benefitted from it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and it specified that what it did not tolerate was “the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies which harm freedom of expression”. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> “The largest enemies of freedom of the press are not the malevolent or perverse politicians but the bad journalists in the pay of greed, of the blackmail and the extortion”, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Under this angle, he was pleased that is this kind of journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic countries and middle-class man who dominates in Ecuador” and, rather than to propose his re-election, “he would look further into the revolution to carry on the way and to trace the right track”. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, while arguing that the organization “was to be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the disguised coup attempts of State”, because actually, “that destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy”. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Who more is, the Ecuadorian president regards as “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries by the means of the judgement of the International court of The Hague, which will reinforce the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgement is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the will to advance together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They should be solved as a whole to exceed them and go from the front one. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> In same time, it is known as trustful in the good resolution of the litigation concerning the maritime borders which opposes Peru and Chile within the same court and it affirmed that it is “beneficial which the Latin America seizes the international authorities if the two countries agree to accept a judgement so firm that it is”. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of its presentation like candidate with the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to aspire to a third consecutive mandate, it announced that it saw this possibility “with much optimism and joy, although that is sometimes rather difficult”. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa ensured that, if it lost the primary educations of February 2013, it would withdraw public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> At the personal level, the power never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can be solved only by the means it political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> “My political movement believed that it was me which guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility”, he affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I gained, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will withdraw myself then political life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If ever we lose, I will also do it. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> “It is my decision”, he affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also has refers to the new medical care of the president Venezuelan, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just discussed with the vice-president Venezuelan Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a medical care of routine was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to go back to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> “That does not mean relapse of the health status of president Chávez”, he commented on. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Head of Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima with the Life top of the heads of state and government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) which ended in a call to a better regional integration in order to support progress, the equality and the security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The deaths related to the AIDS are due to a late detection today. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when him the result of the test was assure: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> “It is as if the sky had fallen to me on the head”, he says while referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful”, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid it with his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> It decided to only take care of its disease and started to get information about it and its eagerness was such as it has just celebrated its 43e birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without any doubt, one of the most former patients of the unit of the VIH of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which it was found in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio has lived with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something of difficult to imagine at the beginning of the Nineties, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more marks. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a private clinic of the IMSS avoided telling him goodbye “because it was without voice”. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In this time, to have the AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, being unaware of their disease, of many people still arrive when the virus already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are opportunist victims of infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, in all the cases after the first announced cases, “the great victory is today that the survival of a patient having begun a treatment the convenient period and survival from the population in general are exactly the same one”, the chief of the unit of the VIH of the HCG indicated, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference which this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologist and expert in VIH/sida, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that since 2008, the scientists concluded that the AIDS was not any more one fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level on assignment on the immune system which the patients presented at the time of the diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> To speak simply, that means that for somebody who would receive a positive diagnosis VIH at 25 years, “as long as it will remain under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years”, explained the questioned scientist. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is 76 years today on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that mortality decreased these last years significantly, in the case of Mexico, the number of people deceased of the continuations of the AIDS passed from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of ONUSIDA), but it is also true that, since the appearance of the AIDS, 60% of the patients listed on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is ensured us that the access to the antirétroviraux drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Then why y-a it still of the deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem does not come from the access to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> It is as that I see it, it is what occurred in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the 12 last years at least, we never missed drugs, the problem is that the patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at stages advanced from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us to an indisputable fact “new patients on ten arrive whereas they present already an opportunist infection, which it is necessary to have a greater impact on total mortality, it is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for that, it is necessary to propose screening tests in a massive way, with all the people who ask it”. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> The specialists and the members of the Council of State of prevention of the AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, just as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who has to make his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, in spite of his young age, it was already carrying the AIDS and suffered from the sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumour which is one of the current complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Any exchange when you learn that you have the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die and wants nothing to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> “If I will die, it is better that I burst myself three times per week”, it they say is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his/her parents know only that he suffers from a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like no matter whom of other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> “I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but jointly responsible, I pay attention to me and the other person”, Fabrizio tells, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to its testimony, those which are afraid today, at the time of the walk of the World Day against the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> That they make the test, if they took chances, more they will know early if they are HIV positive and better it is, and if they have already the diagnosis, it is necessary that they know that one can live like everyone, while being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Its message summarizes the slogan of the battle against the AIDS in this year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> It there has many gaps between the programs of health and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara which embraced the cause of the VIH. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And largest resides in the prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all the places dedicated to that, “one actually increased the distribution of the condoms, before one gave of them us one or two, now one gives us packages of one hundred of them, it is very well, but it results from it, that still today, some do not have access to the condoms”, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among most vulnerable to the new infections, one finds the teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: “What will you make some? ”, posed with sarcastic remark and value judgments by the social workers, the careers advisers, the pharmacists and the health professionals, is the question which the teenagers do not have desire for hearing, the journalist ensures. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposes to reorientate this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only sold with the counters, but that one finds them in the distributors of the public toilets and the places which attend the young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not a question either of paying them the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor Emilio González when it had been asked to him whether there would be a distribution of the condoms within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> “It is not as that which sexuality functions, best is to sexually provide condoms to the already active people”, he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Figures with Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> 13.435 cumulated cases are counted (12.158 from the AIDS and 1.317 of the VIH). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is the 4th State of the country of number of the new cases and cumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of the patients of the VIH. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the contaminations are done by sexual way, 6% per blood way and 2% per perinatal way. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50.000 people live with the VIH, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgement ratified in call by a court of the United States is unaware of the reorganization of the debt of the Vitro group agreed via a commercial bankruptcy to Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all the national companies having of the ramifications in the adjoining countries and having problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> One would thus say that the procedures of survival of the companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the spangled banner, to opposite course to the international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow dealt to the judgement returned on June 15th by judge Harlin Hale of the Court of the bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies without defense vis-a-vis the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Cheer. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will make it possible to the principal manufacturer of glass of Mexico to seize the Supreme court of the United States while being based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> Initially, whereas the judge of the cause announces that the creditors must be recorded according to the law on the bankruptcies of the United States, the court of call of the fifth circuit, sitting at New-Orleans, affirms that the principal procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would imply to denounce the co-operation of international procedure in the cases of insolvency of companies having a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the Model law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of the International trade law had been created for this purpose by taking American Law Institute like referee. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> In the second place, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro towards the parent company, the necessary majority for the approval of the reorganization could not have been obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are here half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of the Commercial Bankruptcies had guarantees the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, which is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against that in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds “vulture” like Capital Aurelios, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been of 45 votes against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A data omitted by the court of call. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On another side, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation that it met since 2008 without stopping with the economic serious attack which faced the United States, reflecting the costs with the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the moment, the company of the family González Sada will lodge call in front of the same court of call so that the vote takes place in its totality, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The recourse of insurance will claim not-prosperity and requires the revision of the lawsuit by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Most serious is that the court was unaware of a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on the commercial bankruptcies, by announcing that released it from the conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as subparagraph 15 of the law on the bankruptcies of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Moreover, it announces that the country yielded with the principles of the Commission of the United Nations concerning the International trade, i.e. the rules fixed in the case of transborder insolvency, which guarantees equity for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile-up of two parts: they strike Vitro and they strike the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General assessment </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Company of Aviation against the ex-owner to the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were overlooked during several months, this one was shown of fraudulent administration, the Property owners&apos; syndicate of the Pilot Aviators already encountered problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The authority, overseen by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just presented a penal request against the Banking National Commission and of the Values which is shown of obstruction to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the authority of inspection systematically denied to have provides information to the Prosecutor Général of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw F/589 trust of the bank 9TH 198 pesos million in the name of Mexicana de Aviación. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds would have been used for the purchase of Professional actions of the Administration of the Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As each one knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the principal shareholder of the chain of Posadas hotel. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> They besiege the Mart Dragon </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Join together in the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of ecologists national and foreign, professors of university, entrepreneurs and members of the civil society approved the creation of a broad face of opposition to the unveiling of Chinese the Mart Dragon in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know it, we speak about a colossal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, in Central America and with the Caribbean of products of the country of the great wall, with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Previously, Canacintra (the National Room of Industry and the Transformation) had succeeds in linking the governors of the zone of South-east in order to be opposed to the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents largest of all the threats weighing on industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The ACTA died </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government proposed a requirement of the senate to explain under which terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Trade agreement Anti-counterfeit, known under his English initials of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of the Intellectual property, this topic is already of the ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As each one knows, that was done well that the senate itself condemned this possibility, because she was regarded as a breach of liberty of expression on the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Long-term Homex </seg>
<seg id="2862"> With an aim of paying long-term debts without affecting those in the short run, the property developer Homex launched out on the market of the Stock exchange for 500 million pesos. </seg>

<seg id="2866"> The investments in this field exceed the 1.5 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Héctor “Hetin” Reyes “The basketball is all my life” </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The sphere-trotter of the basketball “Hetin” Reyes passed more than 60 years of its life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, travelled in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor “Hetin” Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemns it to the wheel chair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport during more than 60 years, that is as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of tennis shoe, a manager and directing of the national team, the BSN, with Vaqueros de Bayamón or as a president of the federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> “I carried several caps in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the federation during the Nineties”, remembers Reyes at the time of a visit of Will precede Hora at his place in Bayamón, where it resides with Isabel, its faithful wife since more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> “The basketball is all my life”. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate when it makes this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of its house, almost all decorated with photographs and memories which point out its route except standards, testify some. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all its memories, those which it is fond of more are those which point out to him its passage as player within the team of Vaqueros in the middle of the Fifties until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a Co-manager or to manage of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> “That was my best years, those of which I the most profited because I was likely to take part in eight championships of Vaqueros starting from 1967, whether it is like managing, Co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> That done many years of satisfaction, including the five championships disputed of 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrew myself at the time of the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, “Cuco” Ortiz, which was a large administrator, took the lead in the team”, Reyes indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and which was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: “I have a player strapping man for you, it measures two meters. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it?” </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It is like that to begin Mincy, one of the best players than had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse to me, who was naturalized and who was one better gunners. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had made it possible Bayamon to gain a championship, Mocks was going to help us to try to gain another of them. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He east is delighted by the championship of Vaqueros with Mocks, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the big shot of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In this time, he preferred to benefit as of his loads and from those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we gained it for the first time in the United States at the time of the pre-Olympic tournament of Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then, there was the World one of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have gained the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play again the last match, declared Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Is the team of World of 1990 the best national team than you saw? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She belongs to best, just like that which beat Dream TEAM at the time of the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my preferred is that of the Pan-American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and that we put a beating to the team of the United States, which was rather similar to that which had gained bronze at the time of the World one. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only made up of Mincy, Mocks, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morals, which had not been able to attend world of 90 because of a problem of knees. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team which was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the time of the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young person Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we gained gold against all the forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Which was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without any doubt, it is about Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics on the level as of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated on this level like made Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that without taking into account its trajectory in the various leagues for which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Porto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In the young people, I like much work that made Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, which is your greater success within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> To have been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the years 1990, the BSN counted to 17 teams in one season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What remains you to be made? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things which I would have liked to set up, like the regionalisation of the minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example that the boys of Pounce play only in their zone and face only teams of the other corners of the island at the time of the national play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the young people travel and play too much whereas that is not inevitably necessary. </seg>

<seg id="2960"> A treating course of the “End of the world” has just started </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, the students explore apocalyptic topics like the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and climate warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This six-month period, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, it knew that it launched an irresistible hook there: the end of “large deducts” calendar Maya, on December 21st, to which refer of many people as being the proof of the imminent end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But professor Charmé did not have any idea from what awaited it during following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax pit that some called “Armageddon of the debt” and a conflict growing implying Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought that would start the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> “I did not realize that was going to be the most apocalyptic six-month period which I never knew”, this week professor Charmé with his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) declared. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If one analyzes what occurred in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we say it, that was a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those which believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor to give courses on “the end of the world” this six-month period, which will be, in theory, the last of the history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> With Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exempts the course “Media, culture and end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, the students explore apocalyptic topics like the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and climate warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> “We analyze that because these ideas proliferate with time”, he declared, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human control. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear armament fell into the hands from terrorists, for example, a war could burst. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students will analyze films having apocalyptic topics and will study how they can be compared with examples of the real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> “I tried to inform my students on what was possible, probable, credible and impossible”, Vacker declared. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the principal campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the professor of Histoire of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professeure of Art history and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled “the end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> “We add “2012” to have the possibility of giving the course again, if the world does not disappear”, professor Restall declared. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In spite of the “imminent disaster”, the students must study, create projects and pass their final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will have passed the Apocalypse day before, which does not leave the student of another choice to work “until the night even of the end of the world supposed”, Restall declared. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses appeared rather popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> “It was complete in two hours”, affirmed Restall in connection with its course intended for the high level students, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the six-month period, on behalf of people who asked whether there were still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> “That me fascine to see what people are able to make to comfort itself”, declares Bridgid Robinson, student in religion and sociology 23 years, originating in Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the Apocalypse, that it is secular or nun, is only one question of comfort, or absence of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Infirmary 25 year old, affirms to have viewed all the apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> “I had never heard of a course which taught this matter”, he indicated. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none the questioned students, and even less one professor, told us to believe in the completion date of the world of December 21st. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> “Our first project treated Maya prophecy, and in a certain manner discredited we it”, declares Julie zegle, student of last year with Temple, 21 years old and originating in West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it acts only of one key date on the calendar, declared Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I concede that there exists an anxiety related to the apocalypse in the Occidental culture, tonic at several centuries, which makes that people react to the changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet caused a rise of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> “In other places of the sphere, people does not think of that”, he ensures. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> It is in majority the anglophone world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University the Room which gives courses to Philippines this year, answered quickly when it was asked to him whether it knew that one gave here courses on “the end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> “Philippines do not take part at the end of the world”, to us-have it answered, as if it were about an exception coming from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a grace of the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall points out that over the years, one spoke about the many supposed dates of the last judgement, and he affirms that if nothing occurs on December 21st, “people will immediately start to think of the next date” or to philosophize on the fact that on December 21st marks the one 7 years period beginning at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The students and the professors take the date with the light one. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several told us that they thought of going to festivals “of the end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> “Sometimes, I call friends and we let us laugh about it together”, commented on Samira Ford, student in communications 20 years. </seg>
