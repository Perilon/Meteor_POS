<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies need to combat fraud in elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But in the centre&apos;s final myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more than the cases of death from stroke of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Ordzhonikidzevski, lawyers for the Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: this new trend will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American States are responsible for organizing the elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most of the governments of the States with 2009 laws, complicating the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November of 2010, which brought the Republicans the 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The result for 2011 alone was passed 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to produce Photo identification and proof of us citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws reduce the period of early voting, undoes right registration of voters in the day will take away the right to vote and citizens, have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 2006 elections no us state is not obliged to make voters Photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana the first state, which introduced a similar request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The us Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 2008 law, passed in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years, they have laws requiring voters to show identification card with a photograph, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec American citizens have no such universal identification cards, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people over the age of the voting age, does not have an identity card with a photograph, issued by the government of the state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, 5 million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required identification papers often exceed $ one hundred. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young, minority and low-income communities. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people, who earn less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years does not have the required identification card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters, which is believed to vote for Democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the Photo identification issued by their educational institutions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Zatos the same States allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who generally vote for Republicans, to be used for voting certificates issued by the clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no state did not require proof of us citizenship for voting. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The first time such a requirement was imposed in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are us citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, apparently intended to limit the vote of Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws banning the registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also limited the rights of individuals or groups to help those who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction did not pass without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make lists about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time that the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early, were African American, although the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of people who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike White, who, by forming 76 percent, among voters who voted early at only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, legislators - Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws were governors Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The actions of the most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the President of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This allowed in part to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules, which came into effect, of course, will hamper the implementation of the vote in the 2012 elections. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats condemneth bias laws, which was adopted, seeing in them a clear direction, not affect the results of the 2012 elections in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Report by the Center&apos;s from 2011 shows that the us, in the case of these laws, represents 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: the new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: to be tested or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test rva gives sometimes erroneous results, negative, and sometimes positive, which leads to wasteful medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctantly rcnp examination, and there is good reason to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To be tested or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We ask two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> a study in the United States, has seen numerous cases of infection among groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret and difficult to establish any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the odds of metastasis 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass a test from 50 years, or since 40, when one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men of African-American descent are at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decisions, once the cancer was discovered. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive and semi-dormant. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to explain the risk of a cancer, offering him a possible, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men, who identified cancer, will not have to undergo treatment, since their cancers are not aggressive and not life-threatening. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will be offering active surveillance, and if the disease will begin to progress, we will start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we define the criteria for making a decision about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still to be tested. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created, to assess all the pros and cons to have a test for the dog. </seg>
<seg id="72"> The document (the English translation will be available in the near future) is available at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if everyone had had enough and was moving, 30% Del raco have been averted. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, this figure would rise at least 50%,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, the estimated 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remains utterly inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is a colossal harm human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today in Quebec has 1500 thousand smokers,&quot; says spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting at risk from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Counterbalancet </seg>
<seg id="87"> The car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> It increases the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime, and protects against Colon cancer,&quot; added to the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> Association also consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large amounts it increases the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Avoid also increased. </seg>
<seg id="94"> In the meat by smoking, drying or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; says the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists have been doing research on the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies can not be called a statement. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to Scc, the study of vitamin E gives conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of the vitamin D is also no clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Braviaѕ the analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer&apos;s message that scientists may be able to find the Higgs boson, caused this boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is thought that these Beauzon explains a lot of the particles in the universe, nothing so much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Moreover, this is the last part, the existence of which predicted by the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, &quot;The least imperfect&quot; description of nature and behavior of matter, but which have not been able to find an experienced by. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But still not entirely sure that he was talking about the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with really new particles and that she strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major congress in Kyoto, it seems, this confirms, although to be sure, some of this is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Will present all the same, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to do it seems minimal, and see what this means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world one law is inevitable, saying that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule, there is no way they are not trying too hard, it would hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But while particle physics is a strange world, it turns out, that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of excluding Realencyclopädie, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;Quantum state&quot; is &quot;Condition&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The particle physics divided into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we are good citizens, called, which was obey the principle Realencyclopädie. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In the other, fusses least, odious gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they may instead be water and the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The site (incidentally, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, the big fall, in turn, into two groups: mesons, who we will not speak, and &quot;Particles of force,&quot; which extends the main forces of nature and to which in some ways appertaineth, the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The very least, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creature, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read the Chronicle, it is thanks to a staggeringly banal Beauzon: photon, or &quot;Particle of light,&quot; which is &quot;Courrière of&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when a particle, with electrical charge, accelerates or changing direction, it is &quot;Disturbed&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, the way a stone thrown down in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> The &quot;Violation&quot; is born electromagnetic waves of (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the headline of &quot;Carriers of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference is that in order for these Beauzon appeared, should be &quot;Broken&quot; another field, Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field far, far more stable electromagnetic fields; to initiate, to achieve very, very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond&apos;s surface, which could only be shaken by a very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a lot of particle accelerator, like those that are operated in Cern - large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such an enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and Mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, and there is no piece of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs, he will interact, wealth, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;Can do&quot; all these studies, asked Ms Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science they are used to test whether the Standard Model (sm), and it also allows physicists to feel the divergence between the observations and predictions see. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Ordzhonikidzevski, some of them passionately wants such discrepancies are discovered, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for &quot;New physics&quot; and even some holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The past, it must be said, still have significant drawbacks, without offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which form about 80% of the universe (oh - oh!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But the Cern of such differences were not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories could even suggest, the Revolution will bring about their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their application in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and who developed the first continuous laser (previous was a pulse) in 1962, said that initially the laser was regarded as a &quot;Laboratory gadget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a sensor light. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The sensor, though it was not his original purpose, now serves as the &quot;Eye&quot; for all digital cameras in the world and won the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but this only shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;Debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate about to resume, in the meantime, is preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless in this critical area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; tried to look out for. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Has lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, tore up his inside, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I gave five years, I have lived seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care viktar - Gadbua in Beloeil, which came before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its job: the incredible weakness, which do not let yourself go to the bathroom and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table, which is delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to feed. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He is facing us, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, made him the drugs, lead him in a bathtub. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage to death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest wish that I am cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;For the life of us teaches that a man must urinate standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter of viktar - Gadbua. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress to the condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on the ability of rights&quot; to come to terms with the decline, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to many people in palliative care, an important event happens and in the midst of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come in palliative shelter viktar - Gadbua, all ill cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Projections giving them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more assistance, called &quot;Therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years old, are most afraid to die &quot;In consciousness from suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me start. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have got a good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I do not want to live,&quot; she said, before being allowed to put her mask to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting for the final days of the recent visit of his son, who came from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In an orphanage viktar - Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which is when that nothing can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants have a place in the field of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Bushos life goes on in the best conditions, which is possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors&apos; shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether comfortg physical, emotional or mental. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we will agree to give mouth rinse of Brandy or Pepsi, watching that he will ask. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetikov we do not make sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death are part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. H., who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> The morning of his son, swilled down a beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are close, as well as patients,&quot; says Natalie Savart, director of nursing. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In an orphanage viktar - Gadbua no day is similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Itbeside the 93-year-old man, who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the yard, Party on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and try everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In recent months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45&quot; - looking says Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients, taken in the orphanage viktar - Gadbua, arrives from home, and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, to the care that is provided, to ease the suffering of the sick, who entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or at home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as shelter viktar - Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home to a large Montreal, specialises more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This large gap in the health care system of Quebec has led many experts to palliative care to fear the adoption of the law authorizing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October is a manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr Balfurom Mount and Dr bernhardt Lyapuant and showing their disagreement with such initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="195"> In the words of Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec doing enough to secure the right to palliative care of high quality before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I have seen the patient, who spent 14 days in the hospital for an ambulance, in terrible pain, and nobody took the necessary measures to facilitate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients want to die, only because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day of trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hope of survival Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist, I stop treatment, she said, sorry that I struggle, she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> All-powerful care no </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr Martel thinks that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, the way they did not fulfill their request, after the team in palliative care ease their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Fujio she Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home to a large Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthesia in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time, or time. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Can no longer pretend that we do not know about the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to access palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The sick, in pain, there is always the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I wish that I had an euthanasia,&quot; which means &quot;I want I became easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible by the journalistic hrant from the Institute of studies of the health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real-estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, of the political parties and the Italian Mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous &quot;System,&quot; beset construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists Mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry,&quot; which it has cost the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how soon this system, after in the case all means, joking Zsák Dyusheno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011 caused a scandal as a by-product of the investigation of official misconduct related to road construction contracts in Quebec, in which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Report Dyusheno&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only to the Department of Transportation would retain billion dollars in contracts,&quot; had kept their instincts to take part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Uniiic Charbonneau &quot;Has already shifted two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that it will be possible &quot;To uncover the scheme behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The case became a 2011-standing anti-corruption unit, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, employees of the special unit &quot;Hammer,&quot; which since 2009 has made &quot;Sewage cartel of&quot; Montreal, to stop inflating the value of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks have been carried out a series of searches, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard muster with - mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> On the list - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest cities of the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> His suspect in multiple receiving bribes for public contracts. </seg>

<seg id="228"> Zambito for several years to 3% of the value of the contracts, signed in Montreal, a mediator, associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, sent money to the Mayor Geraldo Majella Tremblay &quot;United Montreal.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="232"> In Montreal &quot;System of&quot; corruption has worked incredibly well. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Syurprenany, a former engineer in the civil construction, detailed described her to the Commission: in ten he received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to the trip, on the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on matches iihf and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 for sewer contracts, money which he over-valued. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that he took on his paw account for 30-40% with the help of false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, napolnyavshem partymembership cashier dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis. </seg>

<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it would &quot;Pull the strings to further understand the functioning of the system, the swarming ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process she described as &quot;Painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will establish its own investigative group and Observer, in order to avoid questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we go home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacque Dyusheno notice for his part, that &quot;Officials stole million dollars,&quot; but it is concerned about the role of the &quot;Elected officials, who knew about the scheme,&quot; but not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec is 70%, he joked: &quot;I was told that it was merely a reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes to limit to 100 dollars of donations, but, he said, it will not change the situation: &quot;While we will not be strictly limit election spending, the policy will be dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of parties: &quot;We can not go below; a sure grasp of the matters, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and rule of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and cast a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyusheno urge those who laughs, in its own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you in Paris St Germain gerritsen extraordinary scale. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by individual conscience, but it can - and a new dimension Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Arrived great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Beside them I am growing every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also kalmykiaa added. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors makes me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not get along. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning, in the centre of preparation in nif is acting as in Klerfonten&apos; and before my arrival in Saint - Etienne I always walked forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Replenish the years is not a novelty to play matches a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> As a result, the player, as I want to be on the level and to give the maximum penalty. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti support in my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It helps the deputies, as Claude Makélélé, who played in the position where I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti - control of the market? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the first league he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with upscale clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a conversation with him were encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I was recovering from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Trust, which I have also explains my achievement. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="279"> The first League Lyon took place in our country&apos;s leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have much to qualify for one of the 8th finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to be as widely as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to have their say face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in one of the 8th finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether Paris St Germain to become a top European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already there are budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the league, as last season, will be a failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we actually earnestly hope to win the world title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were very close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In may, it was a disappointment, because we were all, in order to reach the finish line first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Typically, 79 points suggest the Championship. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But other team, Montpellier, played more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it would be all right. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title took such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much as we do and what players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder, what in the first place people expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend to 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We proved in the Champions League, that can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons, failing to take place in one of the 8th finals, although they have spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount we were 15 points ahead in the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would disregard for our opponents and to the French. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who was not at the height of last season, had &quot;Awakened&quot; this new Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how exciting first League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Paris St Germain, it seems, from the exploits zlatan ibragimovich. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And that if they say that there is a &quot;Zlatanozavisimost&apos;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this and he proved that he is a huge star League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star of a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> We respected him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respect the people that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did, it is really only. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This stimulates and others to improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have experienced Euro -2012 with France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I ardently wanted to participate in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab some game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw there are many things, and I came back stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play good qualifying matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped for from the moment of my baptism in blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave obraztsova. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama led Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position to qualify for the group to the Championship. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He strict coach, he is close to the players and inspired to victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not like to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has achieved its goal, he qualified us in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> a deserved draw out (1-1), October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> The match gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Eactual fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> The shock in Spain, in my career there was no such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> To pay and sell without the aid of banks - with all </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the Monetary Exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties CЅ fees for processing. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, all, invented Satosha nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange like Bittorrent, which allow the exchange of files between participants one level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take a venue for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Course, reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June of 2011, five months later, fell to $ 2, before returning to today about $ ten (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes the whaling as &quot;The most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;Competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;Like a common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitkoin different from other types of virtual currencies, as &quot;Credit&quot; used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the operation of canvi always in control and handle any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Bitkoyny in all parts of the network is both holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers divises, buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> As running the network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new platezh user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Set of information relating to the deal, sign up for e-mail, with the use of encryption system with dual-key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Network can also check the authenticity of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the contents of the file, you can check that crammed in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book, which was distributed to the entire network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Key stage is the registration of new transactions in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through mathematical problem, which was distributed to computers, decided that, like a temporary Central Bank, receives a privilege to add a new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about the phase of hash of the file, that is the transformation of a large file in a digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;Take&quot; new transaction and adds to her room, before &quot;To be hashed using&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim must be to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros in the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as it is found, among other sites easily verify that it correctly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction thus are inextricable linked with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the purpose of deceiving users very quickly (less than ten minutes) were willing to pay twice one and the theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Computer, determined challenge for 50. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>

<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task also increases with the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites, providing the services of all, was attacked, and crammed the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The defect does not concern the Protocol&quot; - said Pierre NUAZ, which recently launched Paymium - company providing payments real money using the network has. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through that these anonymous Service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But money also has the disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuses to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as blogging platform Wordpress, their resolve. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute weitzmann in Israel, reviewed by the book and found that almost 80% does not exist in turnover. </seg>

<seg id="390"> &quot;30 thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; rejoice Jon holmquist, working in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre NUAZ, another author of books on the currency, firmly believe in the potential of this technology as the operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (and money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but she uses the need to review the transaction, which thus are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> a better control their personal data and may thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> System is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install a new device or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Enough to give the address, which you can &quot;To photograph and to recognize&quot; the phone, says Pierre NUAZ not to worry, because he has already has thousand users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before you will gain, will take some time, but 2013 will be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in its report suggests, incidentally, to reconsider various risks, which is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops had left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan&apos;s Kapisa province (and Surob&apos;). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> From us suffered mainly Afghan peasants, who are considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and disabled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it did with the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Their stand, they sometimes helps local insurgents, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nidzhrab, which I watched from the hills planted almond trees by French loans, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles of the helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since the days of their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking them under the control of the country at the time was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the obscurantism of the peasants, in which they surpassed Al - qaeda, but their situation has improved and these days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The military commanders, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They had turned into traders, exciting state land to sell them under construction, with its returning from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American contract manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even not at war. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in rural areas, like the government, which consisted voller of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who have American largesse: capital outflows are significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world in a time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul now has 5 million residents, one-5th of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in towns filled, both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs for the young people who do not want to go back or in obscurantism of the old parties, nor for the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represents the modern world, and is looking everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment the army is. </seg>

<seg id="430"> Staraya commanders, conducting anti-Soviet struggle, has already taken measures to restore the provincial militia, which would not obey central authority. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, mountainous country with a strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, in the manner of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, by Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April of 2014. </seg>

<seg id="435"> All are imported; nothing is done, except vegetables and fruits. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It is only strengthened the impression that Western countries were there, only to allow them to take over. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, without means of transport, to be exported through the mountains, there is a production. </seg>

<seg id="724"> In recent days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the department of the Corporation&apos;s Walmart and restaurants of the popular networks, the fast food such as &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell,&quot; &quot;Uendis&quot; and &quot;Kentucky are chicken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> No one is to predict, it will turn the tide in 9th, Vale or she is destined to become obsolete in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares support unions and left a number of public organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In raising the modest wage workers who receive a Walmart and a system of fast food, the aim of the protests is the creation of them trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Until this sector of the economy barely covered by union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America came an orgy of-sales, coupled with millions of people and sometimes with hardcover editions. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of the Corporation&apos;s Walmart, in which around the world try 2.2 people, left their jobs and picketed together with unions and leftist activists of the company, whose products are for people with modest and middle-income countries. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many low-wage workers Walmart come only on the job. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Accessibil and range of goods made a Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> , critics say, Walmart can afford to sell goods off in part because there is little pay their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complained of the heavy conditions of work, for example, the shortage of trucks or handheld scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the shares in &quot;Black Friday&quot; was to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The typical worker Walmart, receiving $ 9.5 per hour, these rashod not afford, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will boost salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart will shift the growth of wages on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will be cost them only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> a year they will have to spend some $ 12.39 more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters Walmart a note that the protest occurred just nine us corporations and did not cause any damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In its cash registers in &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 of the transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Representative of the Corporation&apos;s Dan Fogelman said in an interview with left-wing website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of &quot;Less than five&quot; employees Walmart, and that the protests were just &quot;Another mainland&apos;s PR savvy stunt&quot; who organized the Union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free hand!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests have continued this week in New York, where the object was not the department stores Walmart (their progressive gorod not complain about, and it is not), and &quot;&apos; ses&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Mcdonald&apos;s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment of the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants eventually increasing it, but not much, and their average ordinary workers in New York City receives $ 8.90 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less them in this expensive town not earn no one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How to exist in New York for the money, for me, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through &quot;&apos; ses&quot; was almost a quarter of American teenagers who job for their shelves after school, living with her parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw this as a major source of food or planned to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I am constantly highlights an interview with workvidually &quot;Makdonaldsov,&quot; who complain that they have to live on the salary and sometimes even to feed on her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal, a commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have kids, if you do not know what you are going to feed. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The challengers, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday, the &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; on 40 Street and Madison Avenue, insisted that cashiers and cooks of a system of fast food began to pay at least $ 15 a hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the area of fast food was created by Labor Organization. </seg>
<seg id="762"> US law prohibits it to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement harassed and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration has rarely makes their lives. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to cover the Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - extraordinary turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Holdouts </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in the day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of shares in the middle of the day rally in &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; near Times Square, where several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said: &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; says he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrantov supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio, which said that &quot;We must not to engage in support of the workers of fast food so that they have made a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As firaxis New York Times, it was the largest this kind in the history of American sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it had only a few people, though not all of them were workers fast to the public, which in New York employs thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is unclear whether this will produce iskra Ardents of mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;While not fool the brain is obtained medium&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately taken to treat mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the application for the patent podal and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> But the conversation with the head of the group, an interactive 3 D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoftѕ Sharam Izadi is that scientists piercy points - time passed. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Their lures the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell, please, in broad terms, what do your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are human interaction with machines, but has been trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> As long as mankind in Mass was stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat-screen, sometimes poking a finger in them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years and to predict radical changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, Xbox and sensors kinect is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without kinect not be sold, for all the interesting sign management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What else we can look ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite the fact that kinect juliana interaction on a physical level, much still happening on the flat-screen, sometimes in 3 D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input information improved (system receives more data), and the conclusion is. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this work on a third dimensional systems for display on the basis of various technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost to hell with the stupid helmet of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> Popular thing, but do not overestimate whether or not it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It certainly can not be called a panacea - question of Privacy, because it is not always want to be around them about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in their niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not on a broad, and on such a stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures. She is not a camera, a device and wrist bracelet that monitors the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> He is great, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But generally the future of mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Is how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the same time will tell. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just says. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be very difficult to discern. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment of the car? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think, in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more accurately determine people&apos;s reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a resolution on the depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about your work with sensors Xbox kinect, what you claim to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do not have permission, depth or something? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle the current generation is the thing, which can make a start in our work on the top recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not megapixels, and as the Matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work, the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So we need to remember not only about resolution on x and y axes, but Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movement of people very dynamic, and the 30 K / with a clearly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes from our Redmondskiy laboratory made the touch with adjustable delay the process - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) share. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Do not understand how this affects the interactions between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, but does not require its that frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And the number of cameras to increase not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect now there are three &quot;Camera,&quot; one of whom - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But already the third camera - actually, this is a typical sensor of the visible spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially large number of cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate her, increasing the extent required calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analog kinect, to play with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help in determining the top of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented the public for their points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Not you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of the technology of augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the time to walk with a smartphone in their hands, not very convenient, but that is what I think: the coolest would be a &quot;Transition&quot; augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could switch with glasses on a smartphone, head-up display and a lot of other locations. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points - a personal device, in which the forces of the (private thing you see only), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will allow you to work on a virtual objects with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Will submit it for a minute that manipulating virtual hologram objects in the air is not only Mr Starkey of &quot;Iron man,&quot; but mere mortals. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often indicates critics of the idea: no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing to the challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is the 7th breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think, 8th may well be adaptablements of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So far, one of the interesting things - the use of second hand as a substrate for image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is recorded doubleckick! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is technology, which is aimed at giving these &quot;Pictures in the air of&quot; tactile feedback - interference for example, several focused ultrasound beams at a certain point where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak - as if you blew over the ball. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think he feels that the matter should feel at the moment when he see? </seg>
<seg id="843"> Colorise it is a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is another task, which is to beat long - how to make the man, physically located in very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost endless - work and the concepts of running tracks (it is not like in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While not fool the brain is obtained medium, the work is still very much for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things in absolutely its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Models instead of culture - rosbalt. Ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continue the project &quot;Petropolitanus avangarde,&quot; dedicated to the citizens, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The top list got bright people&apos;s art scene. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing allrussian Fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; - controversial artist kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town apperceive kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed all in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and Vernissage. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Picture of kirill Miller always a crowd of spectators, wherever they are exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of mehdiyev Petropolitanus social, philosophical fortune, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright man Petropolitanus avangarde of the late 80s and early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Suranjan people of the city, their appearance on the streets of Ulybki the townspeople, driving up the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took the hands of the pirate radio and became Petropolitanus grinder, as ripe for this complex role all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill, and why are you still going to town is red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose Red as a fashion designer in Aberdeen, type and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world Red is a compromise between the artist, fashion designer and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> The society is not that a little gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocation aimed at making started talking. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when you realized that there should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition in DC nevskiy, where it was displayed my job. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I felt it my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then volna staraya free unofficial artists and new, free, like I had not understood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with artists of the new wave, with, which led to &quot;Pushkinskiy -10&quot; and the wave was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I get the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, but the word. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it is all in your art - clinic... I was important to go to the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where you will have to collect all the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took over the territory on Pushkin -10, and there has not been repaired, there was a musical - artistic club, bohemian club&apos;s House, Petropolitanus s. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were born: prefectures, tequila - jazz, remember the cord led to the project &quot;Ukha van Gogh&apos;s.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang with plywood of lightweight songs, they were in a tight tights, among them was fashionable now the composer Igor vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band played live, she became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was leading many programs to - hahli Galichsky Times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and upbringing he we have got. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;137,&quot; the club of &quot; Griboedov are echoes of art - clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> To our employees and manner of tortured left. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I hero of the century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the 2000 poll was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the &quot;Artist of the year&quot; was named I ended my peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In a new era at the old rules, uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity is divided, you can be popular, but the not - so-cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work in recognizable fashion. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my picture is hits, they pronounced relevance and sharpness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have software exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used social were now to be this is hurt and scared. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns all brains splattered, the tragedy are off. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing a team order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now meet on clothes, guided by external mechanicsa, not the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, maybe he can not throw away and Roger to spit it. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed with the help of dressing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - And we recently saw you in the role of urban -. - cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> It is not me, they should be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Commercial art should be nice, nice, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people crowded flocks, bohemian single loved, the simplest of them other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all crashed on complicity, it is hard to enjoy all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I do not smile test everyone to like. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now need to think, would be like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now every cult hero to 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to Stas mikhailova comes to several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> Has come soon, there is sex social work. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 will not come, and ultimately less management, money, all languish. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing is they do not be fooled, do not want to spoil the family. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in my youth such a picture that one collector they are on the walls alongside Falk and larionov hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confusing. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Said: spiritual culture, a culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture of yesterday, rose by examples of artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, from money for drawing of the paintings. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Kirill, what is lacking. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing: an official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them will be able to engage in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the Kings all is not as it was, the Kings, maybe not quite understand the culture, but they understood that it can be a proper experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In our cathinburg people eat, which could be experts, but they are pushed, because we need a higher experts, which correctly evaluate these experts and will give them the road. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but their different than what they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists, which must find ourselves other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - That for you - petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petersburg - this is not a cultural capital, in Moscow&apos;s culture is much more, where the soil is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our kamny art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have now more than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe so many people curious. Who attend exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> But this layer thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Implemented by means of hrant St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Zemlya in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid - killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with the Russians on board is off to find spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save mankind, a key question, how to continue its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact this planet only two, which can be developed at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is Venus and Mars,,&quot; said senior researcher at the National Institute of astronomical P. K. Sternberg of (construction) vladimira Surdiny. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if Mars conditions more livable, then on the surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can live only at high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... In space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with Flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> four-generation raised on the orbit of the Peas were no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - launch into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies - fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Into space in 1979 sent a couple of quails, to check how the developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get out is absolutely normal young bird. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem with the Chick must find a support, he needs to get back on its feet and to begin to move&quot; explains, the head of the laboratory of the Institute for biomedical problems (IMBP) apatity volodymyr Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, the eggs are not around. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours, a newborn was full of atrophy of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And where the trouble was that through them Nychthemeron they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And two times we hatched eggs, then refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them&quot; concludes, the failure of the experiment with the eggs into space volodymyr Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals last biological &quot;Mining&quot; in an orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But the satellite &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment with rats, which are sent into space since the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It is just been on the Biosatellite program, but, again, is a unique experiment, and such research should be conducted,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to approach the problem of reproduction directly into space until it gets. </seg>
<seg id="963"> an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, the usual habitat, simply can not implement its sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But, unlike animal, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and able to create a proper emotional backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the woman in space travel for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk had tereshkovoy. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious thing, mankind, is a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our chaika flew, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Can she give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Because this is a question no one answered&quot; says veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June of 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child Andriyan Nikolayev was also an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice attended in orbit and even himself in space, to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very little unit has astronauts, who after a long flight managed, and grow up healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;If more, it is dangerous even with the orbital flights&quot; - says cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia&apos;s Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet, humanity needs to find some new path in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Neutral buoyancy laboratory cpc - compulsory stage of preparations for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in terms of nbl astronauts jankunas skills in space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If adult water, albeit comfortable, but still alien environment, the baby - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small if confirmed - life on land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between what he is about 9 months from her mother to drown liquids, then it easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle this makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little, if anything, to forget,&quot; says instructor of the mine emanuela Marina aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Words, if born child weightlessness a more natural state, the need for women to gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, pelvis, its ability to push the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Significant, drop and this, relying on amphetaminetype generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is, of course, in a special camera to go to childbirth, will push it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;Then what?&quot; - non-trivial matters Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> With no sense of gravity, the body is not a skeletal and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Newborn into orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special exercise suit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He will simply be deprived of what it will be is vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring in the land of the disabled, completely disadvantaged people&quot; - anticipated the Committee on Bioethics IMBP apatity ihor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> But, in time, it will be a reality, when Earthlings on the ship will go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The main control and auditing management: Schwarz - verification system failed at the hands of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement czechia have good control authorities and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, falling behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement of myroslav of Calais, vice president of the control and audit office, to the site Aktuálně. Cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the&quot; said the current situation of Calais. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> This report provides a joint inspection Czech and German authorities of control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices leads the approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called schwarza - system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said the group (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs check - out is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be established any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are required to check and to seek fulfillment of obligations,&quot; - Calais. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between Czech and German sides, in which was compared the legislation on public procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> On a parallel investigation, which we started, perhaps, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is evidence that the European legislation say, how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> The information was collected and, even with another unfinished inspection, has found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be &quot;Accurate and unmistakable&quot; but in the use of it in certain parameters behind Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> From this is that it is not enough to create more and more updated rules, we need to focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But are viewed as the project can help you, that he does it mean to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of the law, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means getting such things-to-low (but not always) price, to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will reach, reducing restrictions of orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system will mug up &quot;Securities&quot; so that those who wish to find a loophole in the system, will find it much easier than it would have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the internal problems of the practical application of legislation on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as a functioning system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there such organizations as our petersburga (control and audit office) or this work otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards institutions, something in the quality of our petersburga is bundesrechnungshof by our principle, but there is also the panel, who works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority is similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a unit of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can manage only federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal audit houses. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for local law, it is easier than us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In fact, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be used as a model, but it is safe to say that it is better in all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> So, because they are better at dealing with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, I repeat, a comparison does not like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I must say that even an exemplary country is faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not see any benefit from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement in some way be the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal validity of the amendments relatively short, it has not been demonstrated in our work on the control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we pursue control in fact, there are some delays. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take this into account only in the process of future inspections - we have started to use our new instrument &quot;Risk of detection&quot; through which we ran nearly 14,000 state contracts. We looked at. There is, of course, these changes will also be shown, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Is the approval of the law will benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> One possible problem, is that the rules &quot;Will tighten&quot; and can not be observed. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> During the previous rules-controlled enterprises deep with the provider (for example, the regional operational programme - with regional Council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is in this case to tighten the law this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> System should exclude those who want to capture and to abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal errors, leaving the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> This system will put more pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s recognize that this path will lead. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said the group will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called schwarza - system. What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwarz - system&quot; banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law needs to be defined by any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then the Prime Minister can not resist the work, which has to be checked and to seek fulfillment of obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> We can say: &quot;We will change the law and let it,&quot; but you can not say that will not pretend that nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement rather, as it is formally be done, and it is the right thing to do. It will protect the public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offers disqualified because of a formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The road for slippery, but mostly. </seg>

<seg id="1131"> For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational centre STUDEO, for 6th years we have been working with civic associations tap at the Institute of Jedliczka. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly attend school students of the Institute of Jedliczka and spend with them fun and interesting event. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the money to go to the teachers, and we try to give them the opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> The project of additional construction of the Institute of Jedliczka in the future will be a building in which we move forward with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert will be several bands and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What was the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to create a program that will attract all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For instance, in Prague will perform chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dana of Bart, the tap tap, Marjan Wu Bangguo and jiří Suchá. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Of all of the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you plan any such a &quot;Great event&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In may will be the first to perform at the festival &quot;Prague Spring&quot; and then, of course, will make an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would love to have held view in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the us, I would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About the countries you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics sobhank </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as scary as it seems. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five participants at an electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, has dealt with this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways has always been great for us, that prepared me how often surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> With trips abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have seen to date? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than us, in Russia we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In comparison to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise move independently of the man in an electric wheelchair in the centre of town. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also there in the course of such basic things, like to give way to the disabled in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there is a social organization, which tries to draw people&apos;s attention on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the level of play is far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, you can use the toilet, in the museum, but anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in which we have them with the tap tap a little bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect of the public or neglect is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as this one-time - people strong-willed. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap currently very popular, but will return to two years ago, that in 1998 you made her to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the Institute of Jedliczka as a teacher, I had many young people who wanted something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And because I am a musician and plays including the saxophone, then, together with colleagues wasog interesting musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, as our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity as it is only in recent years, and I have confused? </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European space agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of Esa September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began a close cooperation with Esa in 1994 and in the years that followed, the actively participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to kosmos Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have been doing to space, but it is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Recall, for example, to lecture a. Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, of which December 6, 1933 was in Warsaw astronomical Observatory of the idea of his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to space.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Ary Abramovich Sternfeld recalled that only Dr ján Kostka Gadomski was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 in France, Ary Abramovich Sternfeld won the award of Robert Hesnault - Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsi for &quot;Introduction to space.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr ján Kostka Gadomski (1899 - 1966) mentioned above, later became a great proponent of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in the Polish magazines of hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on the scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Kostka Gadomski became well-known proponent of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925, Poland was built railway an inspection, equipped with rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea is still unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even to crack down or to brake of the truck was to be used by a missile. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about the draisine known only from the newspapers of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> With 1933 Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Studies carried out section of the techniques bezboyaznenny in cooperation with professors mieczysław Volfka and gustave Mokzhitskiy. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops of the work was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in specialized printing the idea of photovoltaic gbis fighter, which offered an engineer rogozin&apos;s atlantist, and next year the work &quot;Air missile - torpedo and aircraft missiles and bombs&quot; author Lelivy - Kzhivoblotskiy. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> The project was developed for military use of the rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects for military use of missile technology to the study of temporary scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operations work ended because of the war began. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The scientific work, devoted to space, appeared in the Polish Press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (weithed towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first time the company is mentioned in november n 1954 magazine of &quot;Problem,&quot; which publishes four an article on Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one professor mthere Subotovich offered to organize society, which will occupy the space. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, had already gathered pace projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 Polish Society of Astronautics (Poá) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and it is autumn Poá became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And the following year the first chairman Poá of Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this role he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> With 1956 Poá made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful sounding rocket rm (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, the latter scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type rm -1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Missiles able to overcome a distance of 1800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was 5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Was subsequently built an improved version of rm -1 a, and in the summer of 1959 Bledovskiy compound was carried out on the two-stage rocket rm -2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was a length of about 1.4 meters, and her weight of about 11.5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the rocket was able to do this research - missile rm -34 to overcome 14.5 km, and her job was overseeing the high-altitude wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962 further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Of the first missiles rm a rocket meteor -1, between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Missiles were conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 inches, and initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Developed type three (designated as a meteor -1 a, -1 B and -1 C), which was organised the size of the camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Missiles meteor -1 and had space with the 0.4 L, a -1 - 0.34 L, and a -1 - 0.62 L. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Maximum range of all three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute was the development of a missile with a meteor -2, and its first flight tests began in October of 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Missiles meteor -2 from the weight of 380 kg was able to lead the payload weight 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then built a version of the -2 and a -3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It should also mention the accession of Poland in cospar (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a National Committee cospar two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Moreover, within the framework of the Interkosmos, Poland has participated in studies of space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot mirosław Hermaszewski became the second space after vladimira vladimír Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abolition of the law on public works - it is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> Statutum caused heated discussions in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Sure, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal - oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that a separate business unit, national economic system, is in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unfettered flow of private capital along with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (wage) price tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> The thing you need to understand the situation, when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods are trying to survive in the economic competition is what &quot;Is&quot; the cost of a competitor with a view to take a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, this means for the majority of entrepreneurs or shifting production abroad, or low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, the rise in unemployment in the countries where labor costs, compared with other, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for them is rising unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The overall situation amplified by the unwillingness of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social economic and social damage to them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> Situation is so well known that need no specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> _&apos;s cavalier methods of private capital will at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the government gives its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in the first place in the change of the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is cost to make his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serve as a tool to cut workers&apos; rights in the field of labor laws. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of a higher level of poverty, but also to the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years there are public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the efforts to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases where self-employed people receive a salary that the state, they should receive extra money that they received the cost of living. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> This scandal became known to the public and in case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all southern EU states, undoubtedly, leads to the same condition, in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social status, are required to emigrate, as it did in the 19 century, or to live in poverty-level wages to the margins of society in the hope that someday in the country is going to come from private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But the question is, where he will take? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, an African still works for the share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media to nausea claim that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital has insisted that the state has managing action to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The question to be answered is whether varmland private capital, is now practically management policy and the whole state, in their own selfish goals? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Unambiguous answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is there almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result, we have a hopeless situation, revealed in corruption, benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserve punishment, but it is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Of the situation is that the state Department of a lack of financial resources to the development of the bills private law firms, which are closely linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills argue the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western-type, but from financial - powerful groups who own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously, the Liberal - oriented democracy now quickly find themselves in such a situation, as described Appianom in the works &quot;Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompéia&quot;: &quot; The state has long been broken up, and the agency have violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal receipt of handouts with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold golos ...&quot; Decent people never ran for office of the ruler, and, in the end, once the state for eight months, without consul...&quot; &quot;Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of finding an energetic man...&quot; Appian Pompéia thought it would be, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in antiquity, in modern society dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital has at its core is not intended for use in public order. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is not different from the past: unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of a fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19 and 20 centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Especially tragic is that the current elite completely ignored consequences in the thousand victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus this trend are systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The decision is the target of political and social reforms, which would strengthen the equity of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Of violence will not do, and can never be released&quot; - sting, the song &quot;Fragile,&quot; where the main verse of the refrain is a word: &quot;Do not forget that we fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons are not like wars, they would not be&quot; a dying goutelle Shnaper, wife meer Amshel Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, caused a lot of feedback. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One advocate for Israel, arguing his position, that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians in the terrorists&apos; other supports the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to think about who in the periodic waves of murders - offender, and who the victim in the end, the current citizens of Israel, including self-governing territory, was born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to take a look at who primarily serve has lasted 95 years of tension (from the signing of the Balfour declaration in November of 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning is based on historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity - is the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era we can find the same alexandru velikiy or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less clear is whether these people are completely independently made their steps, or for their throne was someone who sent their actions to advance its goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and their power could not take place for a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among from astronomically wealthy families are allocated one that could be seen as head of the octopus (do not know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many of them do not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> First News agency (reuters) they bought already in the 90 years of the 19 century, to stop rumors linking their behalf with criminal action in high places, in the shadow of who they were, and which has always led to a strengthening of their power, accumulating wealth or both, in the way of another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large blocks of shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they do not have a stake, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq has 5 members, after the overthrow Qaddafi stayed only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the central bank for Rotshildovskiy Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luiz McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after suffering like Sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst of world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan three world wars created great a 33-level albertus solderings. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the collapse of the monarchy in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially Britain, and one should lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population, approximately 0,5-1 people of (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not use), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method by which a working group of the richest families headed rothchilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the supply of (order AB Chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But this decision is a fake and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (cf. The Fed, which was intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis, resulting in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they have been able to unleash wwi by the murder of the Habsburg heir of the Austro - Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, by the Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended with a sudden, unreasonable in military and economic relations the surrender of Germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia), and, as a result, there has been carving up Central European country, Austria - Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany&apos;s huge war reparations, which set the stage for radicalization of the impoverished masses, then went on to throw the Germans quite strong, convicting perpetrators and offering a simple solution to the leader, then to create a multinational czeckoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to be, and indeed played a role in the 5th column, sparking the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> In the late 19 century, the Rothschild family has provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the region&apos;s historical judaea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>

<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was caused by war reparations for the 2 world War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a third source of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will be able to start, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (to take just a sharp division of people to supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, where the offense breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers confronts people to vote in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist loyal international bankers policy, making all, to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and given control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world&apos;s oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>

<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on the campaign, I actually will cover senatorial salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But this money I would not have survived, for example, would not be able to pay the son of an English school, which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to make money, so they would not be running. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So, as you will be doing business, so as to be able to live? </seg>

<seg id="1505"> All Internet, iPads and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> It is now no one voluntarily do not go to the old-fashioned library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, unattractive a town near Rotterdam, is a unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80.000 is the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the education and to build seven fictional bridges, as evidenced by the euro notes, as richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the fathers of the city realized that they remained the only way to defeat the statistics: to build a library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame Maas of Rotterdam artistural ubo mvrdv, master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical construction, toward the task with his usual calm and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jurors looked puzzled look back and shoulders, defiant Maas Složil from its original gift Pyraminx in size and completed a speech in favor of the project following words: &quot;Dear citizensg!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my suggestion: &quot;The Mountain&quot; in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> nine years of these mountains cost 30 million euros grew. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a project of revitalization, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, &quot;The Mountain&quot; was marked by a second prize in the &quot;Best libraries of the Netherlands 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project involved in national Dutch Eurovision wodden semiramida 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, faceless suburb, all of which could offer nothing but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly ratusha, white facades which suggested the milk plants, has become richer for a contemporary works of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But most importantly - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public buildings of cultural destination. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: knizhnoe geldoradog under the cap for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Here only one elevator, held in the center of the, for the fans and the reading would prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Glass from all sides room is light and easily foreseeable, these bricks and elegant street lights accurately creates a sense of public urban area. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Urban environment was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Vzglad involuntarily looking for the bench, dogs and playing football for boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually bookshelf on the facades, and in mid-scandinavias a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless,&quot; says you should blame the Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We put a classic confguration of space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Inner space knizhnoe mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, libraries, Internet Chess Club, an environmental center and technical facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially pleasant chernykh bookshelf, which serves the Wall, the, the stair railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, textures and smell is unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even experienced architects and engineers roadway, &apos; what is the unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We tried to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager, representing Opština Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once at an agricultural enterprises in Friesland, we met a suitable byproduct of Agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in greenhouses and fields lining in the Netherlands as the roots apply artificial fibrous material mm thick. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and save time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textile an one - two seasons, then it can be thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the Library of the painting - for the first time in this volume - was in the thickness of four inch. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> From the heat and pressure so-called (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top are 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Those who will go the length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafes not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and Wood Ficidae in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about proper humidity in the air on the literary Goré. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> New soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of the environment,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For his heating and cooling is used by the warmth of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountains are under the cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> a farm of laminated timber, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and assume most of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Air quality is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the defence provides a fully automatic roll curtains. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stephane of Spermony, cited above skeptic of hi-tech jobs, has already visited the New Library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verkhayg also were already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as acting coach of traditional Chinese medicine synthia Bogarde, who called Bukenberg &quot;Soul of Spijkenisse, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from its own collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This book was to take the empty seats on the shelves are not yet fully featured kniznica - at the time it was 70.000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> It worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves full of ground up. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than half-empty library&quot; says architect blame Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot; I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus mvrdv managed to solve korolevska task that the professional jargon is called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And they are very young and too uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for the building of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: in the early weeks of the German first made it clear that it will vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Byrlyn abstained in the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany have to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - while not speaking too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO held this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to take a clear position on a complex international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely pepehodite from politics, so to speak, led by the us, the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a single coherent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans again is between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Is expected of them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that the only fumble for a role, but on the path to &quot;More normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly is &quot;Normal&quot; foreign policy with a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to play in national positions, not dependent on the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Economic interests fußball varies significantly from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Did this economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Harmed if Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when important decisions, such as voting on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even the United States has an understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I do not think it was well as in the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germaniyadazh will acquire so certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that with its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different views about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The us, by contrast, is clearly in favor of veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Are differences of opinion between the United States and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In force American domestic politics of these differences was always there. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration in the back, has a sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly to hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant as it always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not happy about the policy of the Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and an important partner in the EU with others? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes the situation is difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can not perform as part of a broader approach and is forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> They do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that for Germany is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as a major international player - not take it upon yourself really important role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or leading role still have trouble coping with Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, is still always gives to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany takes on a major role is different donavan sense. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans are not just to deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From the point of view of Germany is in much worse shape than the us. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must take into account the various neighbors and opinion, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, us influence in European politics permanently weaken, but at the moment the EU do not fill this vacuum, then remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like that, unpleasant or intensifying dislike kiriath plurarchy life! </seg>

<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani - world-famous brands, Polo Ralph Lauren - too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is officially registered in China&apos;s name, which has nothing to do with the firms, from names which it was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the names will not file suit. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then it is not clear, and whether they will defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattlokh, attorney Taylor Wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On the table every week appear on the new case of its kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators to add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci to receive Lu-instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register a Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied the German company, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattlokh open the folder with records for the registration of trademarks in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> September 14, 2010 Chinese companies have registered trademark there zegna samsen Puma, artificial name, which used the name fashion houses Ermenegildo zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are champions of the world copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> There are multi-storey department stores, which sells almost exclusively a fake. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But matters Pattlokh not so. On behalf of its clients they are opposed to the Chinese company is officially received from the registration of trademarks the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Ban Pollock,&quot; brand - passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with &quot;Ban of nowhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So called women, who are hunting for wealthy men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize a wine </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It hurt business, with the need to fight,&quot; says Pattlokh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Trademarks are eroded, a unique position to lose, image suffered tremendously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas were in million, especially in the case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company&apos;s market research clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But to achieve the removal of questionable in the trademark hard, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattlokh tells of cases in which the court rejected claims, because after long opposed the name became &quot;Reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If there are lucky, he will have to pay a plagiarist, as damaged his trademark in China, says Pattlokh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There are also in the case of graphics. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company, which acquired shortly before the manufacturer of transportations by concrete pumps putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> So they still have the right to use the emblem, like a star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Bought Volvo by Geely use a Blue - and-white logo, like BMWs; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Maker of trendy items lost in China at the shirts from Hong Kong and Singapore, which famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 because of staff shortages and outfitting there were obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year was &quot;Returning from emergency in the workplace to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the amount of untreated case on objections dropped by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Is to combat this expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year in CTMO received more than 1400 thousand complaints about the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record and means that China for 10th consecutive years, topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5500 thousand items. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 was paid out 1800 million yuan of the charges. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> To simplify, this means that each registration is averaging 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To overturn it is many times that, as a matter of fact, the German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the fight against Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have managed to ensure that the illegal manufacture them fake auto parts were removed. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But copycat has cemented its right to Chinese trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own shortcomings, as the surname in Germany can not be protected, said Hanno of Venttslery, chairman of the board Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks CTMO rejected claims of. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both the authorities Freudenberg won, but the different factions continue the struggle until now. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We need to be vigilant </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The issue is now before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttslery hopes to bring it to a conclusion and praising the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and takes our time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs hardly be more difficult to obtain, the archive of the firm had to see even acts one hundred years ago, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> five years ago Freudenberg in vain suggested the different factions &quot;Big-digit amount in euro&quot; for the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This makes it clear how much that we are,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The danger of the Far East threatens to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Namely in the case that imitators will register there for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We need to be vigilant,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international position on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should &quot;All that any way is to protect, to register in China,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it may be worth far more than check. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg will lose in the last act of his drama about a trademark, you will have to pay the other party licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we would go out of the controversial segment. </seg>

<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government says the people of Mexico is ready to fight violence,&quot; said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto, US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> To such statements itbeside the US president of the political career of Mr Peña Nieto has evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, in densely populated and extensive state, the capital of the country, opinion about the new leader is deeply divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Straightforward man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In an idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents puts him the revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure. </seg>

<seg id="2071"> Suranjan by the emptiness, which launched a new president, opposition. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision for the country&apos;s future. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman, and, above all, a man who is listening. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in other parts of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad carried, is the most striking contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under flyovers of highways in many ways, he is a suburb of the Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And problems in the municipality also wear dour character of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, drug-trafficking in these areas, were involved troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a vacant lot near the vast landfill in the last two years alone, was found dozens of bodies of the slain women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the government of Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than similar measure in the notorious for violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name, when it comes to the killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about it in the best possible to say that during his tenure as governor he could not cope with the problem of the murder of women. </seg>

<seg id="2090"> &quot; Officials of the state appealed to me like the old gossip girl, disaffected of calm. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people to simply accept on faith all that, they say, and why. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, so you can not, especially when there are so many irregularities and errors ,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Wearing presidential sash on Saturday, President of Peña Nieto with it will take a heavy responsibility. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunity to realize their potential. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble the country&apos;s residents about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navaretta believe that Mexicans of American origin is torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico I walked down the corridor for arriving, approached the area of border controls and remained in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> a few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was known as the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is just a name, just as my friends in Boston call himself Irish, and friends from New York see themselves as the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped at the complex structure &quot;American of Mexican origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Is here, in my grandfather, there was no need for a title or complicated structures. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions and answers. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can not get rid of an American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I took his American passport and was in line for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico&apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda was customary for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The President of Peña Nieto to speak about the rise of the Mexican economy, whereby Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, rather than to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Moreover, President of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not sound. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never really thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, at the point of rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and sees a reminder of the events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is just any statesman to utter a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society they had heard complaints about what Americans would infringe on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And descendants of montezuma are filled with militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex is Mexico&apos;s relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about grievances? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Them enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country the right, and those for whom such opportunities are not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize their potential in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> This was the Mexicans of a particular type - dark, education, from poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember this. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we are taught in high schools and I got a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination, confused and unclear, but we know how to treat as his. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Ordzhonikidzevski, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We meet them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as a people&apos;s second-class, as a fake Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not speaking Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them is due to failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We have not had the silk curtain, finding in the US Fed up life, but lost a spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US as a kid and it reminds me that between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Mexican Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belong to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my acquaintance Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Tigres Del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose their roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In the US call us Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations already are not confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would be able to tell their friends - Americans, which is a beautiful country and how well her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Will not do. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> But given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not perceive these countries such a beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am sorry, but I can identify themselves, location. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And rightly so. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If a majority of Mexicans still can not forgive us how they interact with Mexico and a half century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in the offense for the way most recently in Mexico the treatment of their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battle of the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundations for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The prospects for a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> It sounds, the debate over, senseless, who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the Gaza Strip of rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel&apos;s Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his old conflict in the Middle East have change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; swing round at the Bure scores of well-established reality, and the Palestinians and Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, rocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more violent than previously. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there is no reason to give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be kept firaxis this week&apos;s clash only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will announce the fact that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite incurred losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 villagers blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas build its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian-controlled territory currently more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders are likely to conclude that the work for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the rising influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas is more influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> a resurgent regional leader Turkey, which once was the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, expressed support Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing countries of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Triumphant Hamas supporters claim to create around Israel&apos;s Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group, Hezbollah, and Syria, which increasingly Islamist insurgents are about to topple the government of Bashar Assad&apos;s, and further to Jordan, where the power of the king threatens allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region have occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab countries, in Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi have strengthened the influence of the movement the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not supporting Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are a lot like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic constellations Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;Hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In the military sense, Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israeli missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; meet the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Citizens of Israel can sleep well, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the US has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries also blamed the latest round of violence in the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed by missiles launched from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes to the territory of the West Bank - a significant portion of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protect Jewish settlements, which continues to grow despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party - as part of the preparations for the January 22 elections - teamed up with even more bellicose conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, a very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What sense to pander to the Palestinians and to give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> To give their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, will not start if they can run from there rockets at Israel, as does their brethren in the Gaza Strip? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps supporters &quot;Hard&quot; line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> With the Islamists, who comes to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Defense part of the budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism of Egypt&apos;s president, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, no less so, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the advent of democratic change in Arab countries, deprivation of the Palestinians&apos; right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later Israel in the occupied territories, like the bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression have undermined the basis of democratic order in the Jewish state, and demograficheskii - growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody operation, which is held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, has to pay the growing discontent with the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need outside impuls </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Remains the only solution, which tirelessly encourages sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two-state solution and concessions Israel&apos;s territories in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, not too impressive in the short term, is little hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to contribute to the side of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which is past time to make a decision to cut off the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar has, as ever, advantageous position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation of the movements of Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming UN vote, which could be a recognition of the virtual state of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Our role is to bring the Israelis to the negotiating table, to play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he did not own the peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he is still showing reluctance to connect to solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is disastrously shortsighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia became the law to create a unified and packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the hazards of smoking and image startled cfp body parts in contrast, stand out in the dark green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world to Australian law on a pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different-the same box is glum - olive color with eerie snapshots the affected parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been smoking of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Pomimoraznyy pictures and captions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed on with this Saturday - name brands, which published the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe in the world of conditions for packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of these measures is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis of such a decision were the results of research showing that people are starting to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 will never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Obviously, the very young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring the tobacco company with the help of the packaging&quot; explains, health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing research showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes will not affect earnings transnational corporations, the impossibility of those measures have already seen and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought the initiators,&quot; says Scott MacIntyre, a spokesman for the British American tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will provide more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, by contrast, the new laws and the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandré Ḫāʾ from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd said that demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hiding unpleasant picture on the packaging, rocketed (almost from scratch) since the two months ago, companies such as British American tobacco, British Imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco lost in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal against illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Arifoglu Sandré Ḫāʾ Zico, the company has already implemented some 6 thousand products enterprises of wholesale trade and expects the New Party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures are, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among the part of the population that is directed towards the least. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After taking in Australia of a series of laws illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support for their sport events, as well as prohibiting sellers to make cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government forbade local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit in the foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you sell tobacco products and you have only a small idea to promote their wares on the Internet will show you a very attractive,&quot; says Becki Freeman, an issue of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman increasing number of reviews on trademark, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites like Youtube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen, who are so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare effort and time and made a video, or behind this advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian unit of British American tobacco has said the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the new rules: the state made no claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying the trade has been unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries&apos; trade with Australia are poor. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Wco decision is expected by mid 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of implementing them similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada&apos;s first introduced mandatory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> In the rules adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening of laws are seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Number of smokers in Australia has not obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The picture I did not touch them. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just do not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Merely draws a cigarette and hide it in your pocket&quot; said Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes with photos of cancer of the mouth of the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yiu, head of the store of tobacco products King of the pack in the centre of Sydney, has said the same upakovka complicated task of the balance of goods on shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before I had the unloading of the New Party left a hour, and now four hours&quot; - he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to take and, to ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, well, it is over, closed shop,&quot; he says, hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In the world of electronic networks and constant connection is not all bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our plane was discovered a mechanical problem and he was replaced by another plane, which we and awaited them. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to kid. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Noon at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines or iphone, nor even the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But in recent years, scientists and experts in child development is speaking out in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to get bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This makes the brain to be distracted by an interesting related topics, which probably contributes to creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As in the modern world, we are all constantly any screen, the advantages of boredom pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to strive for boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will be back to that. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many others, believed that boredom - invention relatively recent days, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> This is not so, says Peter Twohy, a professor of Greek and Roman history of Canada&apos;s University of Calgary, author of &quot;Fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Actually boredom has a very ancient history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii found a Latin inscription of boredom, dating back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> The remains an open question of how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The research on this topic and asked the question a task force in 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;Want, but you can not do what they would meet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people do not do something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy nothing to do not want. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> Primarily from boredom, he says, is &quot;a violation of attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time is as slow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> As boredom may seem very similar to the Depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when in fact we just difficult to focus on something. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;One reason: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention,&quot; published in last month&apos;s issue of perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to previous experiment, participants who listened to tapes of voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> The participants heard a loud noises not related to the case of the programs are included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds on low volume, so their, you could barely make out, and a third group only listened to the recording of a voice without any soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The participants, who heard the low volume, noted that they were bored, more than anyone else - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it is boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. Fensk, associate professor of Neurology at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, &quot;For example, studying in the flow of the products in the pipeline in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is, he says, that when people start is riding on a chair to portray scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in reality, such actions only helps not to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research has shown that children who are not prohibited to fidget and to turn, learn and remember more information than children, which required to sit&quot; says Professor Fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments, we bored: for flight delays (in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching this film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But many people are showing less prone to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s to measure the individual features researchers have developed a special &quot;The scale of the propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The definition of such scale used questions and approval, for example, &quot;Much of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved&quot; or &quot;Me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of these questionnaires researchers found that boys skuchaem more girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there is a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But teenagers generally often bored. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he connected with the help of a pager with as many as 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32% said that they get bored in school and at the time of his homework, and 23% said that they get bored out of school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> The only 3% of parents said that they get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that, &quot;The teenage peak prone to boredom,&quot; largely because children and adolescents do not allow in position to decide what they will do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my initial question: boredom useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme, studies show that it can drive people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says professor Vodanovich, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us that we should do something different, and this is the boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But that the brain does not always know what it is better to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are going to be bored and you will find the energy to play the guitar or culinary experiments, you will make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you get a TV, you will be better for only some time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child missing and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not be able to contend with boredom alone or in other ways to manage their time and employment, says professor Fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And the skills of self-regulation is in various situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learn not only themselves to occupy himself something, he also learns self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that boredom should like to praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But there is something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather should learn to feel comfortable even outside a continuous stream of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agree. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see that, we need more likely to suffer boredom, with the boredom is very unpleasant, an insatiable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people are eager to show off the persistent worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In today&apos;s world we are used to the constant over-stimulation of the sensory organs, he says, and when silence, we are lost and do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is unclear how the new law will apply for the legalization of marijuana in Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthoney Orozco, a nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, which holds that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and drove in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco had subpoenas for possession of drugs and devices for possession of drug use and petty crime, for each of which is due to a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;With us be dealt with as criminals,&quot; says Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But the offender is he? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of thousands of small-scale litigation depends less on the law, much of the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Charged with crimes related to marijuana, has already been filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped condemned people aged 21 and older for possession of small amounts that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks day. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in the more conservative counties in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the cases related to marijuana, and still held liable for the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time in some cities to the suburbs of Denver before the mountainous areas of the West&apos;s vote for it, in order to prevent the emergence of their places new licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;It is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora on the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled by scratches his head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are to be established rules for determining the order of the licensing of production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it needs to be done before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, for good or evil, ahead of most of the other states in the regulation of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; said Brian J. Smith, a representative of the Council on the regulation of production and sale of alcoholic products in Washington state. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, says Mr. Smith, rather than to put forward any proposal and hope that it would work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent on which we could focus,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Bill of Washington, called the I -502, will enter into force on December 6, and the whole year will put the state in a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing is not, and the right of possession of marijuana has been legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But there is still a difficult technical aspects, which must be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the disposal of the state of &quot;Adequate access&quot; to licensed marijuana from a ban on trade in her at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Particularly difficult it will be to place a licensed Enterprise on trade in marijuana in a line of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently released study &quot;The centre of the legalization of marijuana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21 the police chief Oates of aurors sent his subordinates by e-mail message that the prosecutor&apos;s office of the town will no longer bring those who have reached the age of 21, with responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops caught people in these violations &quot;From here.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said that the police will monitor respect in the town of rules governing the activities of those crops such as marijuana for medical purposes, and will continue to prosecute traffickers and distributors of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Prosecutor Weld County in the north of Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill he said that prosecutors will still be held liable for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the people who take medication. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> The 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, though many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The responsibility of our institutions to pursue the action, which is considered a crime at the time they were committed,&quot; said Mr. Buck in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the region, no more accountability from adult, for possession of small amounts of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take the allegations are already open cases connected with possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as he does not change our direct responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, who took part in the vote, upheld that decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions of people in different places of state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment Sinfônica with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The County prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier&quot; said Sean MacAlister, Denver lawyer representing convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They are so long people behind this is that now can not really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington, the first us, in which to a small number of marijuana are just as to alcohol is destined to become a pilot flying across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Advocates of legalization and officials of the state&apos;s plans to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are apprehensive waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is scheduled to consider a sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana in the hope that the Department of Justice will concede on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several have received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases to agree on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents by the anti-drug is unlikely to break into houses, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the regulated by the government of the state of the recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, said Kevin a. Mahvash sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the presidential elections of some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for sale of marijuana, which could not open up sooner than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a corner of the state, put forward for consideration-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in a position that we will give somebody a license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and the vote, for which the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There remain many unresolved issues. </seg>

<seg id="2489"> Next week during the seminar, when a teacher of history is seriously called me &quot;Enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In my soul screamer from shame, I was brainwashed &quot;I have parents,&quot; and called them &quot;Old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Respite was short-lived. </seg>

<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Can call me cry-baby and rags. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years, nobody should become the object of such anger and intimidation in educational institutions. </seg>

<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one tourist, France, which took off a few years ago with Skała Kavakhi - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners with Kavakhi - Idzhena earn 5 eurocents per kilogram of sulfur, which produces </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Being at the top, they clear a road between them tourists, who photographed, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy basket, walking three miles to the scales, which mining company located just above, at an altitude of 1.850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about PT of Kandy Ngrimbi, the company, which has been running since 1960, the volcano, and it is best not to say, its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83 euro) petrochemical plants, because this mineral disseminated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening of sugar. </seg>

<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and plot was not that hard, but Anthot returned with his family in Banyuvangi town near the volcano, for good reason, that Indonesia is as devastating as sérou: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, a Hindu, and brought her in Java, she had converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Anthot asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he has the redness began to weep, eyes because of toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> 27-year-old Anthot spent three years, risking an in Kavakhi - Idzhena sérou, which has already started to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he has the redness began to weep, eyes because of toxic gases, which secrete volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> That is the price he must pay for achieving his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Will work for two more years, because they want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French&quot; promises, he is on a more than passable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, but instead he perform the duties of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Dividing dirtyyou wooden huts with other porters, he gets up every day in two hours of the night, because sérou not stop to emerge at night, when her distinctive yellow turns into the Blue and shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging Theneuille, Anthot descend into the crater, illuminating his way with a flashlight, connected to his helmet, which he bought for their money. </seg>

<seg id="2585"> Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept work &quot;As much as we can,&quot; because he needs the money for the education of their three children aged 18 to 10. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Will not retire, will die here, because the volcano is my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sérou is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catch miners in thick plumes of smoke from the volcano, they are so Hardy, that no one complains about their serious illness... More serious, obviously, than their normal breathing problems, trouble, the pain in his knees and sores on his shoulders, which is most under the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Hovering basket on his back, Unaynik now only can lift 50 kg in 53. </seg>

<seg id="2590"> &quot;Will not retire, will die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; says Unaynik, widely by opening his mouth, which do not have a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation, one of the hardest lessons in the world: it is dealing with human mules with Kavakhi - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans accuses career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore will need to rise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> My husband patriot, you are my wife were, follow our civic duty and will create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> May seem incredible that this is part of the advertising of some peppermint lozenges, but despite that - or perhaps because of this is a video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> This phrase is part of the rap, which uses local proverb like &quot;Let&apos;s put Bao (roll) at the stove&quot; to laugh at birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising agency, which made this video, bbh, hope that, with the help of advertisements they will be able to draw attention to the problem in entertainment form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music, for people to fulfill &quot;Its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> These things exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is a major problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in reproducing themselves, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government tried to do much, for example to implement the launch of perfume with pheromones or to relax the rapid dating (blitz - visits). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas, perhaps, a creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely to compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who do not take it so lightly, it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $ 1.300 a year on policies for the enthusiasm of the citizens at birth of a large number of children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> State package for married couples and parents provide up to $ 15.000 per child, extended maternity leave and provide tax relief. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But it has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is rich and high-tech city - state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the National Directorate of the population, are currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of the walk - in 1976. </seg>

<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the birth rate has known impact on economic growth, the nation&apos;s tax revenues, expenses for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences. </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know it is cyberbullying&quot; - confirm it. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Maryelos Porras, our teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that to keep the children and teenagers, need to realize that goal of social networks - to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she notes. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicate that academique Mark Prenski, master of pedagogy of Yale University and author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented the term to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives they are the ones, children and young people, who was born in an era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that the issue is complex, &quot;Because we are asked to have a certain criteria for what can or can not distribute, publish or to speak, in the age when it is not enough for this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also to be selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousand friends, not thinking about the consequences&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confdentiality children and adolescents, is to ask questions, which makes them to think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them that they did not do it, it is useless&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you can not tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have been happy if published the photos you like the one that has published you about your friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that other published about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign a photograph with the parties, asking whether you are letting other people, to commemorate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another, everyone needs to know, what are you doing in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to let them know that they should behave online, the same way they are offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Outside the Internet rights deal with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should be on social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, a professor of primary education and consultant on education, explaining the need for leaders of the families have read a policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> With each of the points they have good reason to talk to children about the implications of the discovery of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The Gaurdiya, the key question is to remind children&apos;s lessons &quot;Do not talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Summit meeting of Unasur ends without disclosure of the declaration of Lima </seg>

<seg id="2726"> Because Europe is in crisis, &quot;Economic integration of (Latin America) should not have a segment basis, and must serve to expand our manufacturing base and to anticipate a better future for our cities,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to give privilegesa group of the 31 iconic projects that will improve the areas of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... By combining our country and forming a new economic plan,&quot; said Peruvian President to read the message. </seg>

<seg id="2741"> Ecuador&apos;s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common citizenship is the goal, in which &quot;South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, state television said that Europeans &quot;Kill each other during the second world war,&quot; and in other clashes, &quot;But now they are practically one country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this context, the project of establishing the South American citizenship, which approves the members of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but until now there is a reactionary sector, which wants to take us back to the past&quot; - he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Ecuadorian President has shown himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who lecture, never undertake no obligation, and we in the South Americans, by contrast, signed by all. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that does not regret this decision, because he betrayed its principles, and comply with its &quot;Profound values of democracy and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that in due time &quot;Was a suspicion that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be honored by the process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, moreover, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual crimes, while &quot;The Swedish legislation to make it through video conferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not talked with him ever since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problems, nothing serious,&quot; said the head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What does have is a danger of worsening his physical and mental health because of imprisonment in a small space without the opportunity to do the exercises on the air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and stressed that the talks in London in search of a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We are not talking about human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant debate. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;I think the solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, is a series of processes in various European institutions&quot; - mentioned it. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And said that &quot;If Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will be over.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and well as it did in other cases, will be examined by Senor of Assange in incitement in London or will question him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not tolerate &quot;Mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distorts the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The enemies of freedom of the press is not spoiled villains, politicians, and journalists, supporting the speculative, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect, he remained bullish that are neither these journalists, &quot;Neither bankers, not bourgeois country - faced no rule in Ecuador,&quot; and added that, after being re-elected, &quot;Will deepen the Revolution to the sustainable development in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to retain veto of Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the agency &quot;Must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support of coups in the mask of legitimacy&quot; because in reality &quot;It has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Ecuadorian President found, moreover, &quot;Perfectly reasonable&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to are now negotiating with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime borders between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which is in favour of nicaraguan morskaya sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment it is observed. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This problem between South America and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Need to handle them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries, which is in the same court Peru and Chile, and said that &quot;The right thing for Latin America to go to the International Court, if the two countries agree to accept the decision, no matter how difficult it may be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> About the opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity &quot;With optimism and joy, although sometimes quite hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if I lose the election in February of 2013, then from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Personally I have never been interested in power, but in this unjust situations, as in Ecuador, socio - economic poverty can be amended only by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement considered, I am the one who has guaranteed the likely victory, so you have to accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If it would be my last term in office of the president, and then we come out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If you lose, the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This decision,&quot; he is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment, which is already planned, the routine, and that it is expected that he will miss the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean the aggravation of the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of the state took part in Lima today in vi summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration for the maintenance of progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS today - a late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I was as if he&quot; - he recalls the difficult, despite all the time of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He concealed it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> By deciding to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to know more about it as much as possible. And his efforts were acquitted - he is already celebrated its 43 birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the &quot;Oldest&quot; patients HIV - office of the hospital, hospital civil de guadalajara (hcg), where he arrived in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the diagnosis &quot;Of the human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (HIV) is 22. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too little then there was the treatment options, too little known about the disease, too was prejudiced against him sick. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;Because he had cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now possible to survive the syndrome and do it, not to the detriment of quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, still many people come, when the virus has already damaged, &quot;Depleted&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged, &quot;Great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same,&quot; Bulgaria&apos;s head of HIV - secession hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that the information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, life expectancy and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available to patients with early diagnosis, with a better life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when it reported 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV - positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, &quot;Maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess the progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today to an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report, Unaids), also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths to may this year; however, that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why still have a lethal outcomes? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - Personally, it seems to me that the problem was not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> The way I think, so it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years, there was no shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late, because of his positive status, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led a devastating this: &quot;nine out of ten patients come in when you have any opportunistic infections; what to do to have a bigger impact on the overall mortality is to make assessments at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples to detect the massive scale, for all people, which it will ask.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal has the same opinion experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), and the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who went to check on private laboratory, motivated by nothing but his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even had Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the more common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think I will die, and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Razès will still die, I will be nadiraeshsya three days a week&quot; - they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I eat, do the exercises, taking medications. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> The avid basketball journeyman Hector of &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was more than 60 years to do with the sport and, thanks to him, over the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few in Puerto Rico stored in memory so many basketball stories, as Hector of &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And it before brain stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player in small groups, the player&apos;s top basketball league, Commissioner and chief Internet with the Cowboys Bayamona and President of the Federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have done many roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, when I was President, Internet, the director of the National Federation President in the 90s,&quot; recalls Reyes during the visit, the Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes not exaggerate, making this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia items collected for his long journey, evidence of that. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotions he kept those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid 50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of his performance in the single - mandate agent or an agent of the contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot; It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight world Championships, the Cowboys from 1967, as the agent - agent or manager. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of joy, including the five world Championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome&apos;s in the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From the moment and will continue to lead a &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator &quot; - said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gina Bártová, which went down here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player, rising 6&apos;7.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Do you want?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And it was early debt, one of the best players, who was in Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bártová then recommended that the sniper raimonds Gauss, which received citizenship and became one of the top scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that said if the debt brought the Championship Bayamona, Gauss would help to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Having the Cowboys with Gauss I enjoy, but at a distance, because the 1988 were part of the head of the Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I just want to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments supposedly in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember how we won the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 world Championships, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be a bronze for the Canadian judge, who made us to beat the final game, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team to the 1990 world Cup is the best team, what you have ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as those that have won the dream team at the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite were the ones that with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to those that we won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> To the team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, remon Rivasa, Fico of Lopez and &quot;Pikulina of&quot; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &quot;Tonito&quot; and James Carter Bratya Leone (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote of&quot; Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 because of a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team&apos;s Olympic qualifying tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role-players like &quot;Kanito&quot; les Neus Pablo Alisea and young rolando of Khurruitner for players, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan-American Championships mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without doubt, it was Pikuliny Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His performance at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level, like Pikuliny. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that does not include his career in different leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best gentle head? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is a very complicated issue. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good young animals, including Julio Toro, Flora of Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Lluís Dalmau Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of young, I really like the work of Leo Arilly. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you think his main achievement in the Federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s the Internet had 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to do, for example, the regionalisation of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that the boy Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now guys go and play too much, and it is over. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and of course for governors, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, watch music videos my time on Youtube, enjoy your grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, and C Abel, which has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2961"> Every week, students explore the apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> In this semester, when a professor of religion Stewart sharma decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he was irresistible bait: the end of &quot;Long countdown of the&quot; Mayan calendar, December 21, who seized many people as proof that heralded the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Sharma had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the &quot;Long-term,&quot; and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the Christian theorists of the end of times I believe that it is the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I did not realize that this will be the most apocalyptic terms of all&quot; said Sharma this week, students at Rutgers University - Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we are only 30 days, it was a really good time. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic way of thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of &quot;The End of the World&quot; in this semester, the latest in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple University associate professor Barry Wacker-reading course of &quot;The media, culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why this idea is spreading,&quot; he said, and the way in which offers a hypothetical scenario, of certain actions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, can get the war. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with the real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell students about what is possible, perhaps, it is impossible,&quot; said Wacker -. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America, Matthew Restally and his colleague Hamars Solari, associate professor of the history of art and anthropology, gathered to read the course, which is called simply &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012 &apos;, to always be able to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come,&quot; said Restally. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;Destruction,&quot; students should learn to cook projects and to take the final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn state final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that does not leave the students of other choice but to work &quot;To the same night, in which is expected to be the end of the world,&quot; said Restally. </seg>

<seg id="2979"> &quot;The place is over for two hours,&quot; said Restally about its course for students with the highest average score, which has recorded 35 students. </seg>

<seg id="2985"> &quot;I have never heard of course, which would teach this&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I like it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of those surveyed students - not to mention the professor - has said he believes in the date of the end of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the latter course at Temple University of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restally. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he noted that there was an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, where people respond to changes around them, often predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet have expanded the speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places, people do not think about it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question about whether he knew any rate of &quot;The End of the World&quot; there. </seg>
