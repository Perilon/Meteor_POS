<seg id="1"> The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justify its policy of necessity of the fight against electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Brennan&apos;s Centre, such a fraud refers to as the myth that election fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning struck. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Republican lawyers, in the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American part of the democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in the US, Canada, have the responsibility for the organisation of federal elections of individual states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in this spirit of most American governments since 2009, promulgated by the new laws that make it difficult for the process of elections, or write to the electoral list. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 of restrictive electoral law in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, override the right to register on the list of voters on election day and voting rights of citizens odnímají registration in the register. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present photo identification půkazu with no US state. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The first state, who led this requirement, Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The constitutionality of the indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of the procedure and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to give identity cards with photographs. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It should be noted that, unlike Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, half-11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with a photograph of their state-issued by a government authority. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It does not have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And that&apos;s not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students who are as voters known for their shift to democratic candidates in several countries are not entitled to use his identity card with a photograph displayed his school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, cards issued by those clubs in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, did not require any state in the election proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The first such a requirement in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, about a dozen states have laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Obviously, these measures are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws that cancelling the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition to limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Those restrictions have their consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken after 2009 but has caused a decline in registering new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%. </seg>
<seg id="39"> For Hispanics, it was the same. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens of voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, there were only 46% of voters who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Against the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built Democratic legislators and their supporters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Democratic governors veto blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Some of them have managed to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, the laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The newly introduced rules but undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and they are seen as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Brennan&apos;s Centre in 2011, the report shows that the states where those laws were approved, account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain already: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American part of the democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> PSA test was often incorrect results, which were wrongly negative or even a false positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies. </seg>
<seg id="55"> All of this has increased the reluctance of the men who had been so reluctant to go to the test. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To investigate or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two experts on the view. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the US have shown a high level of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time in Europe, said the different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who didn&apos;t go to them. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed the 12letém detachment that those who do not go to the test, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore commend examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men are also more at risk of African-American origin. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive forms of cancer and such species that are inert. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is therefore necessary to explain that the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on the life and focus in these cases more active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men who had been diagnosed with cancer cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and threatens them for life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They propose to the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More frequently and with greater precision setting criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore, I recommend the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important and interviewed by a doctor to determine whether it is appropriate to take the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created Movember movement tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (currently in English translation will be available later) at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / Prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> The prevention of disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of the disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving enough, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,&quot; underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancer causing heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Some percentage also remains completely unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> They are also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is extremely harmful to human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers,&quot; the spokesman Andre Beaulieu, shaking his head. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The mass of </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the SCC appeared and obesity are another risk factor for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon,&quot; says the report. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition for the </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommended reducing the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It is best to avoid the sausages, for which is the same. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Smoked meat canning, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;May cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; says the report. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Polls, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Although, according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies suggest the increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly established. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;To the investigation does not mean that you have cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson examined </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosonu likely caused a stir last summer. </seg>
<seg id="106"> There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the last particle whose existence was predicted the standard model - our best or the &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as foretold the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto to confirm the absence of any data yet, so that we can have absolute certainty. </seg>
<seg id="111"> However, let&apos;s assume that it is the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and let&apos;s see what&apos;s happening. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world is absolutely unambiguous law, according to which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This rule cannot be ignored - and don&apos;t try too hard, otherwise you&apos;re gonna get hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - the &quot;state&quot; roughly speaking creates some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The particle physicists further divided into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And at the other end of the range bosony, anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may well be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely wonderful), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of the Berkeley: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and &quot;the particles,&quot; which is a natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way. </seg>
<seg id="119"> However, to say that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you read this article, it is thanks to bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or particle of light, &quot;which is&quot; a &quot;electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When particles with an electrical charge to accelerate or change their direction, &quot;disturbed&quot; by the electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;distraction&quot; an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, &quot;of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> A more stable </seg>
<seg id="124"> It is also a Higgs bosonem, except that &quot;disturb&quot; should be another field, Higgsovo field that the boson. </seg>
<seg id="125"> This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the excitation is to achieve very high energy levels, similar to the frozen surface of a pond, which moves a lot of a large rock. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator CERN accelerator at the laboratory as part of the Large Hadron Collider, the friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop a power. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field suits us once again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Responding to the electromagnetic field, all of the particles or all the materials. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to stick on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And it is true that the Higgs field, the particles do not respond: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as the photon, look at him) do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> And Mrs. Smith asks what all of these studies are what &quot;us&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="132"> From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> In addition, many physicists have literally wants to find them, because the slightest difference could open space &quot;new physics&quot; and close some of the loopholes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the matter (oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> So far, however, the CERN facilities such contradictions there. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Response of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The response of these research in everyday life, Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Behold: At the beginning of the 1960s pioneers laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution, for their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Assumed the scientific use, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous light pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a &quot;toy in the lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine. </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the result of all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The scanner, even though it Boyle first as planned, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily have to change your life, but it means that no one really knows. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to go through life... | Le devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission, through its for dying with dignity is Quebek recently engaged in a delicate issues relating to the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should soon resume, and at the same time is going to the bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> In this crucial area, there is still a lot of work to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Less than a couple of weeks ago, Mr. L. still alone in his apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years of life, and it&apos;s been seven,&quot; said without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s still a shock, you can&apos;t prepare for this,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the toilet or feed himself. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> It&apos;s a bold and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop for him, his medication, offer a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage to a death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, humiliated me,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In all my life and learn that the guys in the urine,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To return to the stage of the child is for some people unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of a person&apos;s&quot; whether the return, says psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> In the view of many people involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place at the heart of such a return. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who are at home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> The forecast is a maximum of three months to live. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses who care for them, to provide so-called &quot;therapeutic&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation in full knowledge. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to discover their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good kids,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;In my life I don&apos;t have any desire,&quot; he says, and then allow us to put on her breathing apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Yet still enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to the son of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body with the help of nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="175"> The death was more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Québeku seems a bed palliative care to 11 700 people. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It&apos;s very little, if we realise that we all have to die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> When you die, you can give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, for example, according to taste. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer need to watch the level of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, drinks beer his son in honor of the late father. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are helping patients as well as their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care services. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days, one after the other, but like each other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to the year old man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while in hushed voices in his honor, died tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children after he tried all options in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For half a year, there is always the three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% from hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problems with access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering as soon as sick in the final phase of his life, whether it&apos;s at home, in the hospital and in a halfway house. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Society for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec, many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, evidenced by its opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec health care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all people to high-quality palliative care before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> As he says, has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days on standby in great pain without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved. </seg>
<seg id="197"> He fears that patients do not ask about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my onkoložce that concludes with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us. </seg>
<seg id="201"> And he told me that it&apos;s over! </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating physicians to fill their wish when their team palliative pussy ease the pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care at the Society for domestic palliative care the Grand Montréal, patients are defending the treatment of pain in the 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of his life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the end, whatever fits and starts, or whether the sedative administered on a permanent basis. </seg>
<seg id="207"> You cannot pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> The patient, who beat the pain, will have more opportunities to access paliativním sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Sick, which is not given a sedative, always say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you to give me the euthanasia,&quot; it means, &apos;I want to get rid of the pain. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="215"> &quot;It is interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken strong measures,&quot; says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It erupted in 2011 scandal on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the former liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays. </seg>

<seg id="251"> In this season with PSG had an entirely new pace. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this development? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> They came to us the big players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I get beside them further. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical team helped me a lot, too. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These allow me every day to raise the level of the game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The games and it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, it is all very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t lose my head. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my beginnings in prep school in INF Clairefontaine after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which has introduced Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is essential. </seg>
<seg id="265"> And it follows that a player like me, then has more flavor to the game, and he wants to make maximum power. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti and gives me a lot in connection with my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> The hands of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> And Ancelotti has the final word at the right time? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, in the first league does not equal and are among the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has vast experience, and with top teams won a lot of titles. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He also worked with excellent players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> For me to win in Paris more titles. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I was behind a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> How do you see the first part of the season, PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the first league us Lyon picked up the position. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in tow. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We are very easily into osmifinále. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is your club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we certainly want to be a difficult match for the quality European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want to win its qualifying group ahead of Porto, to be able to play in retaliation osmifinále at home. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG may be in the short term, a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> The budget for it... </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Paris to become a major European club, must win titles and go down in history. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, it is not yet. </seg>
<seg id="291"> On the financial side of the PSG means to this plan could take place. </seg>
<seg id="292"> And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 league as in last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, really want to win the league title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season, we still missing. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had an excellent season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We collected 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Usually, with 79 points, you are a master. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I think that this year it will lead. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to defeat them. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what&apos;s invested and what we have the players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Absolutely we accept. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something in the newspaper about us, so it is not very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what you people can still want more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> It is, of course, to win 4-0 on each weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We&apos;re not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to set up a game style. </seg>
<seg id="311"> You need to build a team. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season osmifinále, and also have invested large sums of money. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the sums invested sums you would expect that you have in front of the other 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> You insult the other clubs and the French league. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year&apos;s season, too, with the new PSG moved on to the next phase. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how 1 League is amazing. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win. </seg>
<seg id="319"> It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče. </seg>
<seg id="320"> It is good that it says that there is a &quot;dependence on Zlatanovi.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> To come here and show that it is the star of the first league. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has demonstrated that he is a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In our team we respect the man and the players. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has achieved is really special. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This has led others to raise their level of the game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows for the other side by side growth. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How are you enjoying Euro 2012 with the French representation? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I wanted to play in this tournament. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn&apos;t play as well as I&apos;d imagined. </seg>
<seg id="333"> But I&apos;ve seen it, and I came out of it stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I&apos;m able to play good matches in the representation. </seg>
<seg id="335"> And that is what I had hoped for since her team. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our behavior was exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How do you see the first month, Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team? </seg>
<seg id="338"> The results speak for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In the qualification for MS, we are in a good place. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is strictly, is the players around and able to win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> That was and Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has achieved its goal that we qualified for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> It&apos;s a draw (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain a solid baseline game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us added confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> We all fought for the team. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the shock in Spain, I experienced such a game in his career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without the banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing among the beneficiaries. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In the context of these technologies, as is often the case, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on the bank monopolies leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Bitcoin, the inventor&apos;s Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...), and a similar transfer protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs of partners. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> About a thousand Web sites already taken bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Bitcoinu rate peaked at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the verge of about $10 (overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products, it is not impressive. </seg>
<seg id="357"> And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Bitcoin refers to as &quot;the most successful virtual money,&quot; &quot;to rival the dollar and the euro,&quot; and &quot;version of the current money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money, as &quot;credits&quot; used for the procedure in the video game, which one will win the game, or you can buy (and sometimes back to change). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social networking site Facebook also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Each month, but the central authority controls and processes of the communication. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How the network works? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses through e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> However, the user can choose another address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Network so it can verify the legitimacy of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key lies in the minutes of this new phase of the transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It is by means of solving mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional lines. </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is the stage of cutting up the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital print. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computer &quot;take over&quot; the new transaction and add to the number, then the whole &quot;will be cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the start). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number, the other nodes to check its accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is indestructible displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the impression. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user wanted for fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to avoid inflation, are divided into two of the regularly, probably by the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, but can be divided up to the part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> It also increases the difficulty of the task with increasing levels of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The network has had its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and the alienation of bitcoinů. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;Crack is not in itself,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the problem is also true for cash. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is adopted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> The ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, was launched &quot;a huge discounts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars have changed,&quot; says Jon Holmquist, who works for the transformation of Coinabul bitcoinů on gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books on this money, has a lot of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses the Bitcoin system for verifying the transactions, which are cheaper because of it. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, a managing their identity and so can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Just tell the address, which can be a telephone &quot;photograph it and recognize,&quot; explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive,&quot; predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> In its report, the ECB is expected to review the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be successful. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And what next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops have left their area of responsibility in the Kapisa and Surobi (Afghanistan). </seg>

<seg id="405"> And so do we, but we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and all those injured and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, the former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in Soviet times. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though joined the jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekové, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They are currently experiencing tolerance and frequent help local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw their support for the fall. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab, which I watched from the mountaintops posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, orderly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> A convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul with no escort helicopters for aerial attack. </seg>
<seg id="411"> By the end of 2014 talibánci already in Kabul will not be so active. </seg>
<seg id="412"> From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Take control of their country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghans have paid the price for these villagers obscurantism, which completely dominated the Organization of Al-K &apos;Ido, their situation, however, has not improved in our time. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The officials from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They became the junkmen soldiers, grabbed the public land, which sold as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and take advantage of the huge American contracts for subcontractors. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Discredit; most of them had never even been in a fight. </seg>
<seg id="420"> According to what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will not be thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many of the young wants to go as they leave those who were able to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young already tired of the war and associated ideology. </seg>

<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by three decades of war would have been necessary government control infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that is fueling the feeling that Western countries were only to be captured. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no minerals can take place. </seg>

<seg id="603"> What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the &quot;slave labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says chairman Viktor Sebelev FMS Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of their rights should be started before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise in the emigrants without jobs, without education, who don&apos;t know the language and do not have a medical examination. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the knowledge of the language, he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future can be sentenced to clashes with unfair people who help him under the pretext of ensuring &quot;reference&quot; to the gruesome, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="612"> Don&apos;t scold! </seg>
<seg id="613"> The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don&apos;t know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they don&apos;t have the experience even with the work. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it wasn&apos;t their fault, as the disaster: Very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> But also their families in need of something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, shoes and equip school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As children grow up in the retirement age, they must go to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Without the knowledge of the language, it is difficult -. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;Do you feel the humiliation and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders on one important thing. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they don&apos;t have it, so they won&apos;t pass the test, nor any other official would not work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many of those workers argue that gain official status in our country is not easy. </seg>

<seg id="626"> In addition, the costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand. </seg>

<seg id="632"> Staff of the FMS already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language test. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that they will make it easier for the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That&apos;s two and a half times higher than the official test is completed, it will become migrant workers three thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task of the immediate future is to safeguard the system against corruption that workers could simply buy the documents, in that match, government officials and defenders of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Meanwhile, government authorities can promise that foreign workers who can&apos;t handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course in the Russian language. </seg>

<seg id="642"> The government&apos;s response to recent events: The rise were cases of shootings at weddings, which are dispensed with the victims, and the massacre of a Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, in which seven people died as a result. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to raise the age at which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea is supported by the head of the Duma&apos;s committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US, workers are on strike fastfoodů and supermarkets </seg>
<seg id="723"> Work on the premises, &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; goes through to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, in America, raised a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell,&quot; &quot;Wendy&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> This share support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest increase at the salaries they receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, the organizers of protests to achieve the creation in their trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> At present, this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> The 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The action began last week after Thanksgiving in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, with a million people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some workers, Walmart, which works worldwide to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals retail chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Wal-Mart sells around the world everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability of a wide range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> In the words of critics can afford to sell their goods as cheaply Walmart, partly because few pay their employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The demonstrators on the &quot;black Friday&quot; to demand an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical worker Walmart is 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not match the height of the expenses, they say. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion dollars a year. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If the company moves to increase wages, Wal-fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit at the store only about 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year as customers will spend about $12, 39 more than today. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Wal-Mart&apos;s defenders point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; in stores, the company said Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company sold about 5,000 Walmart items of goods per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Treasury carried out in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that jobs out of a total of &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was &quot;all other media sensation,&quot; organized by trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Vacant Treasury!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests have continued this week in New York, where they were trading houses to Walmart (those in that pokrokovém town is not very popular, and therefore there are almost), but &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that sells billion servings of, and then you or paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York City </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York 7.25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one in this expensive city, lower wages. </seg>
<seg id="755"> Well, I don&apos;t see how you can be in New York for that kind of money. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Employment in the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter part-time after school and live with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> At present, I kept in an interview with the workers&apos; McDonald, who complain that it must live on this money, and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal&apos;s comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how you feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; unusual Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and cooks in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It also demanded that fast-food were based in the sphere of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American laws forbid the administration to prevent the formation of trade unions and to punish the activists trade union movement bullying and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other side of them administration rarely makes life easier. </seg>
<seg id="764"> In a fast-food companies, trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The opposition </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other low-priced restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The event was the culmination of a rally at noon at the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s,&quot; says that sells billion servings per day, and then you or paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators also have the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must work together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food sector. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We are the brain to deceive the average.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Between the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately it means, in particular, to view the world through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of this news, and in November, it was announced that the application for the patent, as well as Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft&apos;s Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that the company&apos;s glasses for scientists are already a thing of the past. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The challenge is the prospect of handling of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell us in general, what it is doing your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with a finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility of proceeding with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What is ahead of us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Notwithstanding that brought the Kinect system interact on a physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The flow of information to improve (the system) is a lot of data, but so far no output flow. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních. </seg>
<seg id="787"> The computer world is to be admitted into our physical world, make it more realistic. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets virtual reality. </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the vocal control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is a popular thing, but does not exaggerate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not by the sweeping, only about such Tiffany, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of bone and muscle. </seg>
<seg id="797"> There is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In general, however, the future of the mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - A how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - How, for example, you ask me to give you this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> Say it, and at the same time you show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just talking. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be very difficult to identify. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to get the user to adapt to what at the moment may or may not machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - It is not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may, for example, be a laser scanner, which provide a good in-depth resolution, that is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands of modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Today, it is not sufficient detail, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In the nature of the current generation - that&apos;s what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not just about the megapixels, but as the nuts and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In the current view on the matter are insufficient for us all current technology - that&apos;s the trouble with algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also. </seg>
<seg id="815"> So it is also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced scanners are closer to the second value (60-100 ms). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much it affects the human-computer interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For me, it would be very useful in the work of the equivalent of such equipment, but I don&apos;t need so many touching, but I need some frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - A, increasing the number of cameras is not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second-set reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A greater number of cameras could potentially solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You don&apos;t think in terms of day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course to walk and constantly keep smatphone raised in hand is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be &quot;portable&quot; version of the reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the buiding switch anytime from his glasses on the smartphone screen display and around. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses - this is a very personal devices, this is their strength (private things you only see you), and at the same time, the weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man,&quot; but also ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feels nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What is your group is preparing a response to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In their lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the tactile qualities would have become the eighth breakthrough. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, is one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of support for viewing. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Excellent records compression. </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the solidity of these &quot;in the air&quot; - such as interference in a direction ultrasound beam defined point the finger, a tactile sense, but it is still very weak, as if you blew on his fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To think that&apos;s what it appears that he should feel at the moment, when they see something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - It is a good idea, that we haven&apos;t tried yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is yet another challenge that will fight long - how to get a man who is physically located in a cramped space to believe that is open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (no such as in clubs), a moving platform, as well as the huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> If the deception of the brain becomes the target, so the work is still for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the very early stages. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is a continuation of the project &quot;Petrohradska avant-garde,&quot; dedicated to the people who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and the arts. </seg>
<seg id="849"> At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located recognition in Europe, without reaching Všeruského reputation. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero &quot;Rosbaltu&quot; is an amazing artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man who is dressed all in red, which you see here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, in the fashionable pubs and vernisážích. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Cyril Miller is one of a purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, the creators of the new mythology. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Cyril Miller - this is a striking man St. Petersburg avant-garde end of the 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition to the city, his appearance on the streets of a smile on the face of the citizens, all in the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently picked up an organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all his bohémským life philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Clive, why you&apos;re walking around dressed in red and yellow or, for example, in the turquoise? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - &apos;I have chosen the red color as designer dealing with light and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is a red color of compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public. </seg>
<seg id="860"> While it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and waking up bad qualities. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are aimed to be established. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative acts is an invitation to the debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when you understand that you have to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - On the exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky Prospekt Station, where they were exposed to my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understand what is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then came a wave of unofficial artists old and new, free of the artists I couldn&apos;t understand. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I made friends with a new wave of artists, with post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the &quot;puškinské 10,&quot; and the next wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> This brings me to the theater, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - A all merged in your art-clinic... - For me, it was important to be at the center of a culture of Petersburg, where should gather all the power of creativity. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there before the reconstruction there was music and art club, a Bohemian Club, home of petěrburkské bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="871"> There was much: Nome, tequila Jazz, don&apos;t forget how Šnura brought to the project &quot;Ears Van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Šnur under the plywood and his friends sang a song, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager&apos;s, who is now in vogue. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band began to play live, become the &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg led many programmes sworn-galivských times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them the Trachtěnberga, began his great career, basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; club &quot;Griboedov - that is the aftermath of Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> This way they left our workers and patrons. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, he organized the survey was in the press, the special price was &quot;People in our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> &quot;The Artist of the Year&quot; in the nomination I was appointed me, that ended my peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times, according to the old rules of the work is unpleasant, I&apos;m a man of truth, integrity and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you may be popular, but not too much cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your works are characterized by an identifiable manner. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits in which it is vividly captured the timeliness and the pervasiveness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I have the exhibition &quot;the Russian museum clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are timeless categories. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier, I had been social, today it is painful and awful. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But the clowns all the glamour, takes the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, people face in clothing, focusing on the external drive, not a single person. </seg>

<seg id="947"> We are absolutely normal output of the bird. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then start to problems. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move,&quot; said the head of the Laboratory Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> If they don&apos;t support, the birds chaotic fall and somersault. </seg>
<seg id="951"> After 10 hours, occurred in the newly hatched birds to a complete cessation of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The birds did not respond to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the problem was that just died in four days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; commenting on the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;miniarcha&quot; with animals flew in orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Experiments in the spring of 2013 will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> In biosatelitu &quot;Bion&quot; but will only being one sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> He ran the experiment with rats who were broadcast into space already pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In fact, they found nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was only on biosatelitech, but again, this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be implemented,&quot; said Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing on the ground, the space rats born offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, so far failed. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals at the loss of the normal environment simply cannot carry out its sexual instincts. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, unlike the animals, can in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons, such experiments are not. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Chaika, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether it will be able to bear a child after such a flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;I still have no answer to that question,&quot; says the veteran-space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, he was born the son of a second wife-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open space. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only a few of the astronauts, which after years of birth and grow the health of children. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;Moreover, it can be dangerous, even when the orbital flights,&quot; says astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia&apos;s Valeri Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparations for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in terms of zero gravity, the astronauts learn the skills needed to work in an open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in a strange environment for small children is a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between the child is at an average of nine months in his mother&apos;s little water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is only two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It&apos;s very little to the child had been forgotten,&quot; says Marina Aksenovová infant swimming instructor. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, the attraction. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body&apos;s ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> We can leave aside, if they work promoters muscle activity in childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the body of the mother expelled the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;What next?&quot; Asks Valeri Polyakov difficult questions. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> In the absence of gravity on the body, not the right to form the skeleton or a set of muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to wear as an adult in a suit with a burden, in which he could coach. </seg>
<seg id="997"> They will be deprived of what needs to develop unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;If you go to the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we&apos;ll bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená our environment,&quot; says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So the children born in space today is only a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, once the time will come when it becomes a reality, and when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the OWLs: Control švarcsystému failed because of politicians </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has good in connection with public procurement supervisors and the quality of the legislation, but lags behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that&apos;s what we believe is missing,&quot; commenting on the current situation of Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Similar conclusions also suggests the joint control of the Czech and German controllers. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of the wrong practice says Petr Nečas access to the so-called &quot;švarcsystému.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother him checks entrepreneurs - it is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be set up, and if something from, you can prevent nor Prime Minister in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations,&quot; says Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, which was compared the legislation on public contracts in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control, which we took off about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Put simply, the European legislation regulates how public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We put all this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is even &quot;more and more sophisticated,&quot; however, the practice is in some respects better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still more precise rules on and on, but there is a need to deal with the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What do you do this project can help, what it means for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the refining the laws, reducing and improving the limits, if it does not have a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest price), in order to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But, by reducing the limit of the contracts that don&apos;t necessarily achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Maybe the system into a &quot;paper&quot; that those who want to look for the holes in the system, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You&apos;re talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar to our OWL office, or is it set up differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What the authorities concerned, as well as OWL Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized as we also has a college, just a little differently, but fundamentally both offices doing likewise. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also powers are similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - that the system is a little different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can only control of the federal money, represented by the state resources. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are managed by the county, the municipalities, there are from the level of the federal courts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As the legislation, so that it is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would hate it without specific data, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I cannot say that it is in all the better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is therefore necessary that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Certainly not, but I say again, I don&apos;t like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, are faced with a wide range of issues. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, there was no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to domestic legislation, what was your office for the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, there are already some of its effects? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control of events shows. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Because we are ex-post controls, it is to be expected with some delays. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> So far, only that we are in the process of preparing future checks - we started our new instrument, the risk of detection &quot;inefficiencies&quot; through which we run almost 14,000 public procurement, and we&apos;ve analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will be, because their limits, the conditions of certain types of competition, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The approval of this law, it is more for the benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that will confirm this. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem here may be that she &quot;will tighten the rules&quot; and will not be respected. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are controlled by a person committed by the (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Therefore, the price of the law tightening in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will create more pressure on the red tape. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how it out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us show the way. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother entrepreneurs controls on the so-called &quot;švarcsystému&quot; - and what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Švarcsystém is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be set up, and if something from, you can prevent nor Prime Minister in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We will change the law and allow it,&quot; but I can say that we are going to do anything like that. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules about what is to be done formally - which is right to protect the public. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But on the other hand, it is a tragedy when the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its application - that&apos;s what we believe is missing. </seg>

<seg id="1128"> We&apos;re trying to engage in these projects is. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the fitting of an accessible training centre Studeo, which was the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The school&apos;s students are regularly Jedličkova teachers and give them in activities, which is fun and interest. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students themselves do not have the means to go for the teachers themselves, we are trying to allow them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future, there will be a separate building into which we move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At each concert will be several musical groups and artists. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to draw up a program that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango, Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You learn all the details to www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Are you planning a similar &quot;bombastic action&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will for the first time at the Prague Spring, so there will certainly make an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like to integrate with the speech in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you were, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap, however, a group of disabled people. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How the way you logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as bad as it first appears. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks to travel in the baggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, so far it&apos;s always handle without problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, I wondered how many times before. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to výjezdům abroad you can compare how individual differences in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What you have not yet met? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than for us, we&apos;re in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in full beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is a barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair himself was in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There is no such obvious, as you prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are civic associations, which tries to draw on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to note that the improvement and improving the situation is always depend on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe learning self in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is very normal that a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap slightly ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public or a bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The band The Tap Tap are currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 to set up her? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I, together with my colleague founded the extracurricular musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> But the popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us when we started to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We&apos;re out of that work, which is not visible, in essence, as if there was. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was your goal to go to The Tap Tap so high? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt the potential of the fact that we can do something different. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Showbusiness&apos;s crowded things where one mimics the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a way, it is logical, everything is taken care of new and it takes a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it&apos;s natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are the people who can live a full life and develop, assuming, of course, that they have the means to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if something can people with learning, so it is not only shift for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> This success has helped, too, that you have a hard taskmaster, as many people as you? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do a good job, we must be firm in many cases, and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it has twice a week to go to test the product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so it&apos;s enthusiasm quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were at the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are open to a group, people are leaving and coming, that can&apos;t be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and desire, is always open the door </seg>
<seg id="1190"> The day before the expected at the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Incheba Kalfus will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava form recently with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> All three of the city at the end of the evening linking telemostem singing songs in the band The Tap Tap &quot;End of the World canceled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment, a training centre in an accessible STUDEO Jedličkově Institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million CZK </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Tickets to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age are free entrance tickets v předprodeji Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA&apos;s 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland, a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects, the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, Poland&apos;s path to space began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, 6 December 1933 represented the thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 he Šternfeld for Entry into space in France, the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. John vzpomenutý Gadomski (1899-1966) and later became a promoter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> The Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski, a world-known promoter of space and his contribution was recognized that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925, was built in Poland rolling the car, which should be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and are not known, the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to take the trolley or its application. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about the handcar dobového are known only from the press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the writings of the materials, it is clear that research has reached a stage prakzických tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the proposal appeared in academic journals photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year she work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all the projects of the military use of rocket technology to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of his work ended the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the astronaut (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November issue of the class of 1954 magazine issues in which there are four more extensive articles on astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a company that will deal with space. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> By that time, running projects of artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is promising field. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia for accession to the International Federation of Astronautics (1951) and now based in the autumn, the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This he held until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA significantly contributed to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters was about 80 cm and it weighs less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 meters long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Further development of the type we should be able to actual scientific work - the RM-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km and its mission was monitoring the height of the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, in 1962, was suspended for further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The heir to the first rocket-RM became the missile Meteor-1 offers from 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was designed as a two-layer, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> There have been three types of (the Meteor-1A, -lb and -1c) different sizes of space for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the missile Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude for all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 was v Leteckém Institute of development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The missile Meteor-2 was starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> They were built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Still, it is important to mention Poland&apos;s entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland is also under the Intercosmos involved in research into space on a Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court to annul the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution has caused the public a lively debate. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict between them. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the significant differences in the cost of labour (wages), the price of tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to imports of low-priced goods to compete in that &quot;you&quot; price competitor in order to push for greater market share and thereby increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where prices are the work of high compared with other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital has no social responsibility and accountability for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and to replace a national economic and social damage done in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that there is no need to give specific figures. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of his own people in order to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments are private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to make its own population adopted a price dictates of private capital, particularly in the areas of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are already a number of years of public ticket of food for the poor who cannot feed their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that have employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the breadline. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> But the scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all of the southern EU states quite clearly lead to the same state where people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to be preserved for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that it will come into the country, the private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But there is a need to ask where it comes? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the media to claim that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private equity stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere with the intervention in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then there is need to ask whether private equity does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> There is a clear answer yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Evidence of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation, manifested in the area of corruption, providing reciprocal benefits law, where it is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws by private companies, which are often in conjunction with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the power that comes from the people as they say Western-style constitution, but from a financially strong groups preferujících their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear now that the liberal-oriented democracy is rapidly moving into the situation, as she describes in his book The Appiános Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: &quot;The state had long been in full decay and authorities took over the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and with stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice... &quot;&quot; men of character of the neucházeli at all, so that once was as a result of this disruption was standing eight months without consuls.. &quot;.&quot; It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose a vigorous man. &quot;Appiános had thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to take democracy for self-rule. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> Conclusion As in antiquity, the current company is based on a preference for their own benefit, regardless of the society&apos;s interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the benefit of society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites, without any efforts to reform more profound. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causality onset of fascist and communist regimes, so we have to look at the indiscriminate liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy as a break with the expectations of the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> In particular, the disastrous is the fact that the elites in the future be completely ignore the possible loss of lives, the humanitarian and social disaster, which we&apos;ve already witnessed with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both at international and European level Interior of the Czech Republic, the government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the welfare of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore the system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: The chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing would come of violence, nor can never&quot; Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus, &quot;let us not forget how we&apos;re fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons don&apos;t want war, there would be no&quot; dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One is for Israel, they argue that the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians belongs to the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about it, who is guilty of killing periodically repeated waves of victims and who, after all, the people of Israel, including the self-governing territory, born in the current political situation and the beginning of violence experienced. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My point is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, the sight of who serves mainly already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are based on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who directed the actions to advance vytýčenému goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among those astronomically rich families is one, which could be regarded as the head of an octopus (if there was one of them, I don&apos;t know, but I do not exclude that) - Rothschieldové. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Say much about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop associating his name with a highly criminal acts, which stood in the background and it always meant a consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The shares in almost all of the world&apos;s central banks and against countries where shares in the Central Bank have or are preparing to lead Afghanistan war (against an attack that was 7 countries after invading Iraq was 5 of the country after the overthrow of the Gaddafi&apos;s only four, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist the family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of Central Bank, Bank of America, during the civil war began to issue their own (the government&apos;s) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered by 1963, a member of Mc Fadden Louis in 1936 was poisoned after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their desire for global power has led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars of a Mason, the 33rd degree of dedication Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war to remove large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was removing the colonial mansion in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population at 0.5-1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury, and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the end of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are false, and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So after they managed to assassination of the heir to the imperial throne-U R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, Czarist Russia destroyed by the Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and then the fragmentation of the European powers, Austria, Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the release of the Second World War, let the bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation, Germany imposed a huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalisation&apos;s impoverished masses, and then they had to do was to give the Germans a sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering leader and the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should play, and I played, the fifth columnists, sparking a fire. </seg>

<seg id="1319"> Already the Balfourova Declaration, a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler off the chain, which kept him at first international bankers, or what was in the plan, it is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp set a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Officially, Israel was founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created an outbreak of war in the third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish people, like the other victims in the front line of fighting, now jointly with the Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of conflict and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided between supporters and opponents of the people of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> There is a need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, had decided to international bankers on people&apos;s choice in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and given over moving through the control of Iran, which travels 20% of all the world&apos;s oil shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy. </seg>

<seg id="1333"> It is important to understand: Who has the sense to combine the numbers of the beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number indicates the man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The movie Argo: When is the worst call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, demonstrators occupied a crowd of Islamist students the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the Revolution, the patron saint of his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw overboard Shah couldn&apos;t afford, because it would fundamentally undermines confidence among allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The detention of the diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations brokered the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their plight has sparked a wave of solidarity at home and protiíránského sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo describes one episode in the history of America has brought a small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the embassy have fled from her six employees. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After the complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, has helped the extravagant a cover story - went to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed the location for filming the sci-fi epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which was invented by an expert on &quot;exfiltraci&quot; Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The legend was credible, on a film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called &quot;right movie,&quot; the story during a piece, foul play - for example, a series of Danny&apos;s teammates. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film, the mood turns - on one side of the documentation or evidence on the concept of a sequence of Tehran (titulkové sequence of events are shown ikonické photographs and the way they were in the same situation presented in the movie - big differences in that are not). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there was the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleckovi is remarkably successful restart a career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third feature film, after the Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first Affleck picture, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> A feel for the atmosphere of the place, one of the characteristics that warned older films place over the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> He and Affleck in Argos, where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when a move out of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (false staff at teheránském bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many times in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with the fact that told the story, in fact, does not offer much in the film of exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there&apos;s not all so elegantly (a scene in which the looming crisis on teheránském airport refused to call in America and chase down the runway is too far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> But the weakness of the Argo ramblings arising from the need to show too many times in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are very charming, but their figures would have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Affleck film loses a little bit of a dramatic move, it&apos;s a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But hard to push. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a sort of living history as well as proof of how much they are images of allpowerful and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare the &quot;absurd regulations or ideas from the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;That led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of the large European companies,&quot; said Patrick Nacher Právo organizer of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The nominees absurditami is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of premium rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far, the women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies objectively. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Another incredible ideas from the EU, people can nominate by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial EU regulations are even mandatory admixture of biofuels into the fuel, which is harmful to the environment as a result of the ban on the use of mercury thermometers reliable because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or about the size of a hen s cages, which this year is significantly more expensive eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also faced criticism before the de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or removal of incandescent bulbs from the sale. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> High-quality bananas have 14 inches </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The camera is often under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto by the requirements of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the lobby, as well as for the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and could not be &quot;anomalous twist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission is hindered by the fact that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which complicated trading. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Rules on fruit and vegetables have softened over the opposition of some EU states, pointing out that the existing Directive lead to food waste. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for victory in the poll may be the last year&apos;s EU regulation, which must be sold balloons in mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU&apos;s appeal to the American research, according to which the balloons are the leading cause of death among children&apos;s toys to suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Similar restrictions now pays for children up to 14 years in blowing into the carny frkaček. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Quaint ideas are born and at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> It is quite absurd and rule on the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece must instead to talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire put forward in the polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities even EU regulations on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set a maximum amounts of food supplies, which could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> For example, the Czech Republic and then crossed the volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which he had threatened a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey took the idea to pay for some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to the request to obtain subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> However, these ideas not in Brussels, but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We&apos;re handicapováni that we don&apos;t have the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union for reimbursement, &quot;he said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As the argument that so many grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the Czech Republic has continued to ports, according to the EU should Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission turned out to meet the Czech Republic by a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered by municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular should go to write applications for subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A more serious problem, according to the experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which forced Member States in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions among Czechs raises and that, as well as other countries of the European Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs had a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians strike indications of Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, for us, for our manufacturers to rename tuzemák. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The rum can carry only products made from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the EU&apos;s official list of registered products in the company of world-renowned feta cheese, Gorgonzola, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, were already Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr and Žatecký chmel. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Mark the EU can also boast the Pardubice gingerbread and hořické tube. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want to save the republic, but I&apos;m an amateur, Okamura says </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Senator, how a man that he wants to run for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It&apos;s not to be a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If it worked in our country without any problems, so nekandiduji anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t watch the last twenty years the country rozkrádá, as the thieves running, people are raising taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something I don&apos;t like it, so I&apos;m trying to come up with a solution to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was 40, and I&apos;m an independent nestraník, I have no choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You got to the Senate, but then you started to the Castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I&apos;ve said all along, that the fight for the Castle will go according to the outcome in congressional elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My aim is not function, function is a tool, how can I carry out his vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That&apos;s why I need the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not just that, as a nation in the black and in front of the TV, but that trampling on anyone who wants to try to change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Add to that the media, which man dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me, to be argued that uplácím journalists, or that I was adviser Jiřího Paroubka. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let&apos;s go to your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have to fight for the Castle, the material and criminal liability of politicians and rear-view property returns over twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change the law. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1431"> But you don&apos;t have such powers as president and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I, as a citizen lobbying to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, is rejected, and that citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent nestraník I have far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My priority is that without partisan categorization and dogmas I can take something that is best for our country, from each party and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself more as a right-wing or left-wing? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important, if a little to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important for us to go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It&apos;s not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always I will support any public good solution, even though he will propose the Communist Party, or ODS, and so I&apos;m going against a bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Čertíte when someone tells you that you are a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it interacted with what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you construct byznysplán in the company, and you have an ideal target and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you&apos;re trying to close. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all proposals on which, in the world of work, or talked about them leading experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament, you would have just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that, in the long-term nevystačíte. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that if you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I don&apos;t have any choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to push it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the president of the parliamentary parties to enact the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality, which will tell abuses, may be pushing on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I&apos;m not a genius, or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For his views and visions of trying to find allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> In politics, I have only just begun, and for your program will try to get majority support. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The things I&apos;m trying to push myself, if it doesn&apos;t, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that in one person to do nothing, so I walked around a number of well-known people, whether they would also stand as candidates for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work he refused. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud, with light heating oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I&apos;m in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who went, mostly elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The Senate navolili people so that it will be difficult to push changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Still, I&apos;m going to fight for your vision, such as for the direct election of mayors or generals. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering establishing his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I hadn&apos;t even thought about it, because I don&apos;t have time to check the net past any potential Party man, and I don&apos;t have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I don&apos;t have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have the money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You&apos;re talking about property returns, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The private property I estimate about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a parcel of land about 25 million, an apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Aston Martin, by the way I have because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women and at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Drive an Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million, and you don&apos;t have the money to the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but much of their own money to give you. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> To get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that on my program might not be so interested. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I don&apos;t have an obligation to pay from his campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will cover me basically what I receive senátorský salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I nevyžil from him, for example, I couldn&apos;t pay the son of an English school, which costs 30 grand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So you&apos;re going to continue to do business, you can live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you say that these activities utlumíte? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that has nothing to do with the amount of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I&apos;m part of their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, a manager of the travel agency in the spring will be my representative. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like me to be Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much are you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Two hundred to 400 000, which I take on. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I were president, I would end my business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of The rights. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books -- 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;This building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is once again to see something interesting,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig that goes over the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the large enterprise, says: &quot;Of course, the house is nice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> However, I wonder what today we need the library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have the Internet, iPady and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> In any of these libraries in the old-style today, nobody goes voluntarily or, yes? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs that are not worth a visit, holds a special record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> This town of 80,000 people, the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to resolve this silly situation, there were a few years ago, the decision to contribute to the education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive but was less than glowing. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city councilmen recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: We need to have a library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely courageous column graphs and the contractor of humorous, often even cynical buildings, accepted the case with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas according to the size of their gifts for himself and his aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words &quot;Dear urban community.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> This is my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros stacked. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Revitalizačního is part of the project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November was a mountain of books will be honored the second place &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Small-town gray, which still could not offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly Hall, whose white facade, you would expect more dairy is richer, thanks to a bit of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But, above all, is now the first public Spijkenisse cultural construction in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> A long journey to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Reading the Eldorado under the cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The middle of the mountains, while riding an elevator, but the real space and reading passion you find on foot to control the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Of all the parties with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly express the spirit of the public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> You see a park bench, the dog and the boys and girls who play football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all the books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally there are shelves of books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark space, which is usually neútulný and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We built a spatial configuration upside down and the space for the reader, we went up from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: In the middle of the office, the library, the chess club, organic Centre and the operator of the technology. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> The special comfort are black bookshelves, which are one lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The unknown building material shaking their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots-millimeter webs of synthetic material. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Is a cheap and time-efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles will last one, two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into a bulky waste. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library was the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - pressed down on the plate thickness of four inches. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The effects of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like the sports shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps you get to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly about the humidity in the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Gifts for a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;I think you wouldn&apos;t believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass desktops a project, in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Vytápí and cooling the warmth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad glued wooden beams, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shield and pick up a large part of the solar radiation. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the will fully automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, already visited a new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Even Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Also, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as &quot;the long-awaited soul&quot; Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: Each of the city a few weeks ago, he was invited to the opening to pay a book from his personal funds. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently stands at 70 000 pieces. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has proved. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled with. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than half empty library,&quot; says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation, now has a new home each of a relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it was just for show. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse said the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> No matter how young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is, the starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the decision-making on the adoption of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle, Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that he would vote against the proposal to the Palestinian observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained from the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, however, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel prudent. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I think I will not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> That ultimately put NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which has been run by the United States, so to speak, in the direction of German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are between the two lanes. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think of setting up shop in its role as yet, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> On foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly is &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and his relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other nations, and that Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in countries around the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, they must be careful to discourage the public, but the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I didn&apos;t want to give too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In any case, it plays an important role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Damage Germany&apos;s relations with the US, Germany, in the case of two important decisions abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think in Europe and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I don&apos;t think it was such a dramatic break as in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Germany, perhaps even get some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, the US is clearly called for the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are between the United States and many European nations differences? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These differences existed as a result of America&apos;s internal politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But as a result of the political situation, of course, cannot hold this position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem to. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not too excited Netanjahuovou policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and with the position of the EU&apos;s most important partners on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that&apos;s what makes it difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> For Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward on its own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is just what they are doing with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> It has always been a sensitive topic. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself as a major international player, wants to take the lead role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is it a leading role for Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to it, it&apos;s still uncomfortable, and for the country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany takes a greater role, creating the post of mood. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That the Germans, not easier. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It is an old problem: We don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The impact of the US in European politics now continues to decline, but the EU is currently not filled that vacuum. Who else is there? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans simply will have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they don&apos;t like it, it makes them feel uncomfortable, and it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, the Institute, in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together are studying the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;The protection of brands&quot; in China: When the Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani&apos;s world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is the designation, which is not officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, enjoys protection as long as it is the real owners nezažalují brand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether the amass. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect its brand in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in the protection of rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, lands on my desk a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> In addition, counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can make their own brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> From Gucci, for example, will be Lu-Gucci and Prada have registered instead of Prada-Kyus. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> In this way, they are legally copied and German companies, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> 14 September 2010, left one Chinese company to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. The name parazituje even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copying and violations of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities are multistory department stores, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeit. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But other cases are Pattlochovy. On behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office, the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; the brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is focused on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> This meant women who are rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is damaging to business, we have to fight,&quot; invites Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Mark is diluted, exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, particularly in expensive sample products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research for CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing the fastest. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> The deletion of dubious records in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, however, and that&apos;s worth something. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claim, because the name has contested after a long duration of the &quot;market realities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff has the misfortune plagiátorovi still has to pay for damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, he lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Although the 2.3 grade point CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and premises. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the last year, allegedly &quot;the work of the emergency situation back to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> For example, the number of unprocessed of objections fell by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was concluded, 57 000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To do something against it is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than the year 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It&apos;s a record, and it means that China is the tenth time behind a list of new applications in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This is also true for the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> It simply means that each on the average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of a German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> This group for more than seven years of fighting against Chinese plagiátorovi. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the forger for China&apos;s rights to the mark Freudenberg continue. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We would be able to retrieve it, because in Germany last name cannot be protected, &quot;says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the company&apos;s management Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The 2.3 grade point CTMO then also rejected a Munich firm. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In two other instances, Freudenberg its rights, but the defendant in the case is further today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It is necessary to take a careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it also says: &quot;The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old files to produce evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, the company offered Freudenberg counterparty in vain &quot;high six-figure sum in the euro&quot; in order to settle the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;You can see what it means to us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe will. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> And that&apos;s when there are unprotected brand imitators. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> One Chinese producer in Germany, for example, wanted to make the Freudenberg for footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This area of the business, the group had given up, he was able to avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is necessary to be very careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> He and a lawyer Pattloch advises the German companies to be very cautious in trade with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international známková. Foreigners would rather have &quot;everything in any way is worth protecting, log on in China,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama to the mark, then I will have to pay royalties for the opposing party&apos;s own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or will be in the contested segment pushed out of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: The thumping, singing, aid </seg>

<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen and pimples and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore nezpozorovány. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How is it possible to protect? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, however, do not offer 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases and infections may be partially transferred from impurities and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> The king&apos;s 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;Aids is absolutely taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has nothing to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> In fact, strange enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger found evidence that in the area of the planet, which lies in the shadow, there is ice cap. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It is said to be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 feet thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water seems to come from comets, or perhaps even from the asteroid belt, which came into the Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> But none of the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, &quot;said the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our eyes into space: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei it a year later, he used to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> It was the largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror in this picture was an average of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In the US, Arizona&apos;s Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Provides insights into space by two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is enormous. Just a mirror measured at an average of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to-costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Still, his average is about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of cheap way of construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem angle in the high-rise, which limited his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> In the high-rise angle is fixed, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> It is a high-gain of flux. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror mirror dalekohledům is the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists searching for extraterrestrial signals. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help every owner of a computer, which will be available to its computing power. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Look at the post of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> It says the Very Large Telescope - and it does to his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> The telescope, with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the mid-infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The Very Large Telescope is planned for the Chilean Observatory ESO. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is full of 42 feet and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrored elements. </seg>

<seg id="1871"> The scientists are based on the fact that the ice at the South Pole Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> For this, however, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger circling the planet far closer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The radar measurements showed several decades to the ice on Mercury. </seg>

<seg id="1895"> This is documented the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšů from around the country who are more than a hundred years. Fatullayev shows a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years had fathered a child. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> The star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, who allegedly was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And, given that the oldest man in the documents was 122 years of age Müslümovův seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this area, and died in 1973,&quot; says Fatullayev. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children aged 136 said he had fathered a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> He is therefore Şirali Müslümov at his age a few decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> The aged people in Central Asia, however, heard the Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog Max Planck Institute in Rostock. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;A lot of people living in old age, and in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also in Sardinia is extremely many very old men.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1907"> Every day a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> But the fact is that the people in the area around Leriku live biblical age very often. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, there are 20 people who are more than 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why are so many people here in the south of the ancient? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the specific genes Talyšů. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> On the contrary, the director of the museum Fatuljeva believes that it is in nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But that&apos;s just the calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and milk products, and many of whom daily drink a cup of melted butter is so healthy, in terms of bromatologického was not credible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the old way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young. </seg>

<seg id="1933"> Old people in Azerbaijan, at least do not need. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euro). This is here, from which to good use. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And maybe he&apos;s right, the son of a grizzled Mirzajevy: &quot;Old people enjoy high esteem in our culture.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1953"> But what does &quot;the principle of&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists this vague wording and associated legal leeway to use for a stricter interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least it illuminates the newly added section: In all matters relating to the sharia, you should consult with the University of Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great deal of influence on the whole Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It may not, but it may mean that klérus will exercise control over the legislation, which would bring the effective withdrawal of justice. </seg>

<seg id="1962"> It is legally worded so loosely that it could use this section of the state institutions even control the content of the film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain language, it doesn&apos;t mean anything other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Indeed, no section in writing does not define explicit equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But another section prohibits shaming or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> It remains unclear, however, what is insulting and how it will be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally dubious is the wording that it is forbidden &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> In this case, it is already a caricature of President or a joke at the expense of experts law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursí present for the signing and his words will be &quot;very soon&quot; to present the Egyptians for the popular vote. </seg>

<seg id="2002"> Five million people living in Norway, is one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> It might be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a couple of overripe cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put it in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Let it a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I&apos;m in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> There is snow, a beautiful view - and the ever-present odor in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in the water for up to a year, depending on how much you want to fish stank. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As the dark and getting cold, start with the Norwegians here in Fagernes on the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best nejpodmanivějšímu food. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete glass,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called &quot;Rakfisk general&quot; who is responsible for the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> All around us people eat small cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people have rather than the rakfisk aquavit,&quot; says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Beverage can smell of the match. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> A few pieces of try. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If the fish can avoid your nose, it&apos;s not that bad - it&apos;s like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when he was in Norway, poverty, and because there was no fridge, fish in the fall as they arced away into airtight barrels of water and salt. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eat - no doubt senses dulled the alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2034"> Nepředvádíme, we don&apos;t like the pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the industry&apos;s most of the money invested in a special fund for future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw money, which should not, the Norwegians had on its purse strings tight. </seg>

<seg id="2039"> Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I&apos;ve had enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Such an elk burger is certainly something else, and it&apos;s a juicy. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But the evening&apos;s smelly fish here again. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> They have a link to the live television coverage of the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem. </seg>

<seg id="2046"> &quot;This is our scoring, Håvard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> With the applause and laughter. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico City is currently a particularly bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital, causing chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Facing a daunting task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico during the term of outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, however, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has taken an estimated 60,000 lives in the past six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence,&quot; the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he shook hands with the US president, president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are different views on the new leader in his old homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A man. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in good. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> He attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Now you can go to the city after one of the new highways, which let Pena Nieto. These highways are a vast improvement from leaky and rugged roads that have been previously. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the issue of climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect that will bring real and lasting change,&quot; says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, we hope in an interesting and real change in the field of security and the economy, which our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After continuous 81 years in power, the party, the PRI ousted Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos from within the party for Enrique Pena Nieta many expected. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> And the opposition refuses to comment characterizing the new president as a man without a significant content. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It&apos;s a very straightforward man, very biased with excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It&apos;s a great statesman and is a man who knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many of his former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad she cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Tucked under the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the Autonomous Community, are also persistent and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help in managing drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly the violence against women. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Only in the last two years were in wild places beside a huge waste dumps littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, was killed in the State of Mexico, more than 1,000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> In the best case, critics Pena Nieta say that during his term in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> And, in the worst case, accusing his leadership of closing one&apos;s eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In the concrete house typical of a run-down neighborhood, Buendia Irinea shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Islands Luna and crying. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her house, so it seemed as if her body had been washed,&quot; says Mrs. Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs of blows and had already begun rigor mortis. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> As her mother tells the story, Marian looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: &quot;Justice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> State authorities they treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want you to just accept what they say, and silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it cannot be right that there have been so many errors and omissions,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Sash, president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> In the last six years, tens of thousands of families were affected by violent crime in Mexico, the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that the president will be the same as the governor,&quot; he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad she fears the most. </seg>

<seg id="2116"> The army said that for him the restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the guards in custody knew that I&apos;m fine and that I wanted to abolish the system of injury prevention... so I can enjoy the high quality of life, as I saw it,&quot; said Manning. </seg>

<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of the hard times, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was hardly his way through the crowd, and I came into the room for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> The arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;) and the other for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Strangers&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn&apos;t know where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called &quot;Mexican.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston as &quot;the Irish,&quot; and my friends in New York call themselves as &quot;the Italians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I ended up in the &quot;Mexican American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in my grandfather&apos;s homeland, it was not necessary to use abbreviations. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> However, I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of native speakers and I can&apos;t get rid of an American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for &quot;Extranjeros.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I was thinking about the moment this week, Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama in the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were the issues that are, as the leaders of the two countries will meet: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the likelihood that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico&apos;s war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons over half of Mexico&apos;s territory to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So a minute after the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children Montezumy starts on the warpath. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want to talk about the hostile feelings? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers possibilities, and others who did not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, come from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not against Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even though we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Is to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn&apos;t like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our existence is, in their view, only a failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families in Mexico have failed, it would never left him. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we are now found no imprisoned for silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but he still lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in childhood had come to the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know, feel as part of either. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love listening to the Mexican group Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You get the best of both countries, but you don&apos;t have roots in one. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, for us is viewed as the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, combined with the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a &quot;makeshift ambassadors&quot; and represented the Mexican interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Well. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It is going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many of the hostile feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I have a feeling that it is up to you, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to deal with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was dealt with their family members in substantially more in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm.. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> We may have more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battles, a new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain the basis for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such activity is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Maybe it means that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war, which is neither won nor lost. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems that at present there is not much reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has suffered defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza&apos;s 1.7 million people in one of the poorest global and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well decide that time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so that Hamas won a powerful and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, revived regional power, which was once Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, have been added to the side of Hamas. As well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering people from Hamas, saying that the Islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, to the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where the king&apos;s allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, above all, on Israel&apos;s southern flank changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the contrary, the Brotherhood&apos;s cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Hamas in the future diplomacy may appear as a player, who cannot be excluded either Israel or America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, come to the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has its price, and many of the Hamas rockets were destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis can sleep better - for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> And - Israel to prosper, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in front of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the start of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you really ruled in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when it heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even though the Islamists, who gained power in Egypt and other countries, not Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israeli defense spending is higher than the cost of all of his four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The fact that President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and it may be the start of something new. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis also should look at the situation in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel, as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Currently the repression of the democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody attacks against Gaza held every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need incentives from the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is what they say reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper: Two states, Israel referred to the territory because of security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar must do more to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer virtual sovereignty to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In his first term he ignored the show of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is woefully short-sighted. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia entered into force the laws on the ugly cigarette packaging </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Green on the backs of the boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warning for smokers and the sick part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian laws on the packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands replaced the general olive green boxes of ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body, and a display of children and newborns onemocnělých smoking as a result of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the various health warnings and images are required from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the small print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> He relies on studies that show that when people start smoking at the age of 26 years, there is a 99 percent chance that they never quit. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell his product,&quot; says Tanya Plibersek Federal Minister for Health and cites studies that have shown, for example, that children are combining the crown in the log with the idea to be a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This legislation will be a serious unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia would bring more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Other states that the laws have increased their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, said that the demand on cigarette packages of silicon used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal for the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that the company has sold almost 6 000 Zico wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> It is a good deal for us. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> As a possible problem experts cite the popularity of social media in that demographic groups to which the plan aims. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and you have only this little room for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the &quot;average John.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We have to ask, it&apos;s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> , British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory in 2001 warning pictures. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More stringent laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia is resisting. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The pictures of me have no influence. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Just ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You pull out a cigarette and put the box back,&quot; says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the tumor in his mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that thanks to a single packs, the harder it is for him to hit the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Unloading it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government simply was completely banned, then we said, OK, this is the end, closing up shop &apos;,&quot; he said, spreading his hands. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I won&apos;t lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly coming up with praise nudění. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that, for us, our children (and) is good sometimes bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And given that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don&apos;t have a chance to enjoy the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should therefore support the boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, has a long history of boredom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century AD. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is also the question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, &quot;said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After watching the research literature and demonstration of ideas to an audience of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience, &quot;I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn&apos;t able to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from the apathy that person is not involved in anything, but I would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He says that there is no need to do something for apathy. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> He says that &quot;the disruption of the process is at the heart of boredom, joined in a bad mood and a sense of time probe cruised slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom is a lot of depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment, or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think the bored, when we only have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which he read an article in the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while a third group didn&apos;t hear it at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard a television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble with concentration, but were not sure why, and attributed the problem of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you&apos;re trying to concentrate on a difficult or exciting task, can lead to distortion of boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, if you&apos;re doing something boring, &quot;such as the search for the bad parts of the factory line, distracting music can help with that, you get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to stir, to learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit in peace,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all are sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, the speaker, particularly lengthy film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help with the measurement of boredom in the 1980s, scientists have developed a &quot;Living for susceptibility to nudění&quot; (Boredom Proneness Scale). </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale covers issues such as: &quot;Many of the things that I have to do, and it&apos;s monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&apos;t have time to do it all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents have indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored when they were in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He said, however, that he knows that &quot;adolescence is the time for boredom,&quot; which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: &quot;Boring is good for you?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo a physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, &quot;said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain is not always the best thing you should do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you&apos;re bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do that. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won&apos;t be bored, but learn how to entertain themselves or self-drive, said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learn only how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think we really want to celebrate the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical to her. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of range of the business and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We are accusing her of the need to be bored, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> What people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní,&quot; he said, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to keep the noise down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and football player from the southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in its state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that a September day went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - petty crimes for which the penalty for each $100 - and set the date of the court. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They treated us like criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But it is a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after Colorado vote on legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use of hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on-the-spot rather than on the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police department to stop blaming adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the more conservative districts in Colorado have said that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western hills votes on the prevention of the opening of the new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This thing is evolving so quickly that I don&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Heads of the gossip and regulators in Washington State. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, it is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use, and now and recreation. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But, as Mr. Smith admitted no place or the system can do more than suggest what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent, according to which we can manage,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which there will be no more state licensing system, but legal possession of it. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state&apos;s directive on the &quot;appropriate approach&quot; to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children&apos;s playgrounds or children&apos;s centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> 21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer prosecute offenses for possession of a small quantity of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police &quot;with immediate effect&quot; to stop blaming people for these crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In the Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at the time they occurred,&quot; Mr. Buck said in his statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reaction has been complicated, even in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the joint initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, has already grown blame for possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all ongoing cases of possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;m losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> It is for the district prosecutors&apos; cultural barrier, &quot;said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They spent so much of his life prosecution of people that still cannot accept the fact that this is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to a small amount of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the way to become a national test cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and the patients who used to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> While protidrogoví agents may not be out the door to catch a small bag of the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state-regulated business with recreational marijuana permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the administration of President Obama&apos;s drug policy. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several Colorado cities waiting for the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he can open any trade. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose on the western part of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license and then we will have a federal matter,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are looking at what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state voted. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There is a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I&apos;m a conservative.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Their views are not only attacked by today&apos;s college students. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I don&apos;t remember that I ever dreamed of studying at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> As my father and my elder brother had studied at the university, which I think is the world&apos;s leading knowledge-based, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And while I am at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and dashed into the first scandal of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke down and wept. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objected to the love of students in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from the battered cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less comical. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the alleged enlightenment that was as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You can ask why this up until now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Just because of the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of center is suffering similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students demanding the same protection of equal rights to gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of their political views are &quot;often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear that they were not welcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The committee called for a position in the university for equal opportunity, to ensure that their views are free to communicate. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation, or the recent documentary for BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories of the country: Young, intelligent and right-wing) on the student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The program was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA Oxford University Conservative Association), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and silver head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Conservative students at other universities say that he is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as &quot;a scapegoat.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper that &quot;left-wing influence in universities is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think that we&apos;re a Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Said a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is &quot;bad,&quot; while 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people to the right of center has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During his first few weeks at Oxford, I was a member of a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred against the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> A year earlier the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of the former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> From the atmosphere, the Stalinists they fear. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> During the first few days in the opening week of the new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, who had to come. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I found that not only professors tacitly approved needling conservative pupils, but with a taste even participating. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> In the paneled classroom was the policy of the strike, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> My first lecture on the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I wasn&apos;t ready. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;the first paragraph, please.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> It was hard enough. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dessert dough, was a bilious. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?&quot; He asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students snickered. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that you do in your spare time took some basic lessons in French, that is, if you&apos;re not too busy social issues,&quot; said Professor Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Heartbroken, I returned to her room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a tap on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the conservative freshmen pretending that they are labouristi. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick has proved unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: &quot;You are the daughter of fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are infected. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The other students notovali with him. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was sick, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Conservatives love?&quot; One asked. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> Hitting each other, right? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so as to how they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Sometimes I could lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Three years in front of me to develop a purgatory ignore and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> He was the only openly conservative Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for the fact that he is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Almost wasn&apos;t there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his shift to the Marxist-deterministickému view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he joined the place of a professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You won&apos;t be happy here,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to commute from Oxford to her parents&apos; house in London, seeking refuge in their non-partisan metropolitan friends and family. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that Oxford I hate and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He couldn&apos;t believe it. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, were adopted by all political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it&apos;s the best place in the world,&quot; he exclaimed. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They wouldn&apos;t do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His moist eyes became troubled. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Try it again. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I&apos;m sure that it is just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart if you left. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by the frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> In the course of the next week, when the next history professor in utter seriousness said that &quot;the enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Even though I was inside flushed with shame, I admitted that my parents &quot;brainwashed&quot; and I called them &quot;old fogies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Was only short-term relief. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The nail in the coffin of my career, my father hammered. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time, he wrote two columns each week in the Murdochs &quot;newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was inside, and after five minutes you my pursuers. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me usmrkaným wimp. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to this kind of intimidation and rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, which not only was 14 of the conservative prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the undeserved reputation with equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino has elegance, rather than glory.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2544"> Princess d &apos;5 návrhářovy has imposed a formal dress &quot;very carefully... because the clothes are not only clothes, it is also a set of memories, which are in themselves.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2555"> When it says the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The toughest job in the world: The sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano in the area </seg>
<seg id="2557"> In four of the euro gamble medium in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur swoop down the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom it is their work, and there are those who work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make their living from Kawah Ijen volcano conquering the sulphur in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Because of this, every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with air passes into a solid state. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them on the shoulders of the two bamboo baskets stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it&apos;s just 250 meters, but exhausted bearers for over 40 minutes before they get tortoise pace up because they maintain balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from Kawah Ijen rocks. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which earns </seg>
<seg id="2565"> When they are at the top, making her way around the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired is hard to the basket to weight, which placed the mining company, at an altitude of 1850 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit from a volcano in 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, as this product has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto us, which usually carried out three trips a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> One way it takes him three hours and at the end of it, but he can then earn 138, 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and salary in a fortnight&apos;s two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: &quot;I got married with a young girl from Bali, a Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In his 27 years of Anto three times daily risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it has already begun to take their toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases escaping from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price that must pay for it to achieve his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work for two more years, because I want to open a trade or to study Spanish or French,&quot; promises more than passable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be a tourist guide, the waiter or the reception in the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and every day she gets up at two o&apos;clock in the morning, because sulfur at night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow color changes in blue and September in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet and bought it for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 media are on the shoulders of the sulfur from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining nezmechanizovala because of cost savings, or provide porters working on their own and with such vigor, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from a surcharge on photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to collect the natural park from tourists who come in to photograph a volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for livestock, and not for the people,&quot; says Madrusin, a 42-year old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left the school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, &quot;as long as you can,&quot; because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I&apos;m not going to retire, I&apos;m going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turn and traps the miners in the thick fumes from the volcano, the miners are saying that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems into arthritis pain in his knees and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Unainik who balances his basket on his back, in his 53 years may pick up only 50 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his colleagues in the volcano vydolují 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting a steep path between the trees in a warehouse in Tamansari 18 miles away. </seg>

<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan LifeSavers, but still - or perhaps because of - the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of &quot;give a cake in the oven&quot; as a mockery of birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BUT, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem of this advertising humorous way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Artistic Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to meet &quot;his civic duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> &quot;This is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which we must touch. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government was trying to expand on a lot of things like perfume with pheromones, or organise the rehearsal dinner parties. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative thing, such as the composition of rap to solve this problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The guy who&apos;s taking it too lightly, the Singapore government. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> 1 will spend $300 a year to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars per child, extending maternity leave and allocate financial benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> All of these measures have had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in the south-east Asia, also known konzervatizmem its leaders and strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the structure of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a degree of recovery, in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why Singapurci do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Mingová Tan Wei, director of the department of marriage and the family of the National Bureau for the population says it&apos;s because of &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only a marriage and family,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> While in the context of immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people it has caused resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> Some of the Singapore&apos;s Web site to see the overt xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and a desire for integration. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year, the Singapore government party its worst election result since the beginning of independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election, to tackle the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> The unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the decline in birth rates are well-known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to oppose so many small home. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, began to affect trade with real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that can build in certain urban areas. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments are in the area of 46 square meters and had great success in marketability. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that these apartments may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build a large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claiming that their &quot;shoe box&quot; sold far faster than larger houses. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> &quot;They are more popular, so that they will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with bigger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Therefore, for our cash flow much better. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one of the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed out </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is the city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a big effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, is that many people,&quot; says the young officer. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> &quot;The others to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, &quot;says another, about twenty, young man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women in her career, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevents them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So long as the government is trying to force people to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the last word on the creation of a family. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What&apos;s private is private online and offline, </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, is something that is personal in nature or the &quot;area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is this privacy for people under 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How is this definition in their daily lives and on social networks? </seg>

<seg id="2650"> &quot;It is the biggest secrets would be published,&quot; says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> &quot;I give my nice photos or pictures of how we play. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> He also said there are known. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> I did not share a picture that wasn&apos;t mine, or a picture that would embarrass someone, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge says he knows all 35 friends on FB and their nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most of the relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Among them is the mother, who has a name and password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> &quot;I started an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting contributions. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> I don&apos;t know if someone says to me, I just got, &quot;added. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can talk with relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Even if he didn&apos;t care if he recommended by a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> Case of 14-year-old Jose is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager&apos;s own accounts on the network of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and at last the network admits that he doesn&apos;t know 20 people from your list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I&apos;m not afraid of that, because we have something in common, such as music,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to this boy, he didn&apos;t instruct none of them for anything, even after it didn&apos;t address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I urged or required it from me, simply remove it from your account,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José volunteered to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boys are not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana). </seg>
<seg id="2671"> &quot;The famous friends on the social network was being blackmailed. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and asked for money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> He never knew who he was, &quot;confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;I just activated the private mode.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> After a series of steps explains how the account set up safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge this boy published pictures of known in the unpleasant or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> &quot;Of course I would do it, if someone was or should I just wanted to. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of the Education and teaching, believes that to children and adolescents in social networks focus properly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is informed. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> States that: &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means for finding information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, to introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> We are the digital immigrants who we have to learn, and they&apos;re still learning, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He explains that this is a difficult issue, &quot;because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not ready for that yet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> Also to be - as regards the area - reasonable, at a time when what he wants most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, &quot;he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to this Specialist is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it&apos;s privacy, asking questions that force them to think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them to do something, it doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Furthermore, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or: Would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published a pal&apos;s? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other published? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, you asked them for permission? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more: They need to keep everyone to know what you&apos;re doing? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The next item is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> It&apos;s the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One out of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and it should be on social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The supervision of </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is necessary for the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> &quot;If we can understand every guile, have a good basis to talk with their children about the consequences that can open an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima was not published </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without issued the Declaration of Lima, which indicated that was allegedly signed by the seven presidents. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and presidential office, who set out at the beginning that the document will be published at the end of the summit, said that will be published later on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantou Humala in a few short press statements. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists have throughout the summit, limited access to information. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In the press room during the negotiations was transmitted by video from the presidential meeting without sound with the message &quot;confidential meetings, the transmission of sound medical practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> A small amount of information that they had available to journalists, was granted press spokesmen of some governments, who have been meeting here, but not the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document published during the negotiations, a list of participating presidents, triggering a backlash of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who demanded more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Peruvian presidential office later sent an e-mail to the media, &quot;the final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is just an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document that the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, the third summit host Peru Jihoamerických and Arab countries (América del Sur-países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion was originally promised the Declaration of Lima published, even though it was the press was required. </seg>

<seg id="2716"> Peru&apos;s President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which starts on Monday after hearing the defence talk of both parties to discuss the dispute, which has launched a Lima against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;Are we going to do, and the judgment to resolve the dispute, which is now in this international court dealing with,&quot; the president said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts,&quot; said Piñera and greeted the president Humalu handshake with the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents, to submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week by Bogotský pact, which has expressed its commitment to the judgments of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua and Colombia this decision was completely wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner). </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay has been excluded from the organization of the Unasur in 2011 after the withdrawal of former President Fernando Lugo and did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for the opening of the morning speeches and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The president read the final document, which reported that it had taken 16 agreements and was scheduled activity on 31 projects between the South American countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In addition to the agreements mentioned that the member countries of the Unasur will take &quot;important steps towards the goal in the form of a South American citizenship, which are distributed to stay.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2726"> When Europe is in crisis, &quot;does not have the economic consolidation (in Latin America) winning the substance, but is intended to increase our productivity and show a better future for our nations,&quot; said Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects to improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural and border areas... that our country should be better connected, and create new economic ties,&quot; he said in a speech čteném Peruvian president. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> He mentioned that five of these projects to Peru and the axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to better link with Ecuador, however, did not give more details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to her return to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> One of the issues that the summit was the need for Latin America continue to be prosperous and peaceful area, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos before its participation in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the dispute on the maritime border, which is disputed by Bogotou. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) will meet with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will discuss all the solution, neither are not excluded, no agreement with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with that country,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope I will be able to say to the President Ortega, who led the negotiations to the more civilized and kindest possible form,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico, where they are to attend the inauguration of President Enriqueho Peñi Niety. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> At the summit, the EU defence ministers provisionally met to approve an action plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the defense field. </seg>

<seg id="2739"> Peru&apos;s temporary chairman of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Ecuador&apos;s president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, &quot;South America, in this case, you must learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit Jihoamerické Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans&apos; killed in World War II, &quot;and in other conflicts,&quot; but now they are virtually one country. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which member countries of the Unasur support. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that we want to return to the past,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Ecuador&apos;s president, among other things, that he agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the impact of the Anglo-Saxon countries will be reduced and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> &quot;Those who are in the lead, never came to nothing, and we all signed the South Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is financed by the United States, &quot;he said, referring to the political asylum from Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> President Correa has confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and his &quot;deep respect for democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He said that at the time &quot;there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, &quot;the Swedish legislation enables the questioning videokonferenčním conversation, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa has said that there is a risk that Assangeho of deterioration in the physical and mental health. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I haven&apos;t talked to him since he&apos;s in the embassy, and the ambassador has informed me that he has a small lung problems, but nothing serious,&quot; said Ecuadorean head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> &quot;There is, however, that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> That would have affected the health of each, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the London talks to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> &quot;We&apos;re not negotiating on human rights, in this case, we don&apos;t use that word, but still continued talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the lawyer Assangeův Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings in the various European bodies, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> He said that &quot;if the United Kingdom will leave tomorrow, it&apos;s all over.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden to hear Mr Assangeho still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as no problem for the legislation, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be an end to this problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and made clear that he does not tolerate &quot;podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermine freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> From this point of view, expressed pleasure at the fact that no such journalists, &quot;neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even the bourgeoisie control over Ecuador,&quot; and said that, if re-elected, &quot;will continue the changes brought the right way and in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur, at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole &quot;must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality,&quot; because in fact &quot;destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> In addition, Ecuador&apos;s president, said that it is &quot;entirely appropriate&quot; the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time when the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment, the judgment is not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> &quot;It is a problem between the South American and-countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome will walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is widely considered to have been overcome, and was able to go forward. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2769"> It also expressed the hope for a settlement of the dispute on the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that &quot;the right to search for Latin America is an international resort, where the two countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, whether it be as hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, said that he sees this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only make political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> My political movement believed that I who ensures that likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> &quot;If I had won, it would be my last presidential term, and then I went from politics. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, it&apos;s the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> I&apos;ve decided, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> &quot;I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign. </seg>

<seg id="2780"> The head of the Ecuadorian state is now part of the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for greater regional integration in order to maintain the development, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The AIDS victims are the result of the late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was like a lightning struck me,&quot; says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor was trying to &quot;help mitigate,&quot; but apparently without success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> Before the boy&apos;s family kept. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take his illness on their shoulders and began to inform about it. And with such commitment that celebrated the 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients Units of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At that time, the director of the clinic with him or the Social Security Institute (IMSS) say, &quot;because he was cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then have AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> It is, however, a lot of people don&apos;t know about his illness and they come when the virus caused the destruction of the body and vysílil immune system, and then they become victims of random infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years since AIDS emerged in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, &quot;is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient in a timely and appropriate manner to begin with, it is exactly the same as in healthy people,&quot; said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infektolog and an expert on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, it means that those who are HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings &quot;in compliance with the treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems,&quot; he said in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To underline this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In the state of Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - &quot;It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> The way I see it, that&apos;s going on with us in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don&apos;t know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Adds compelling figure: &quot;Nine out of ten patients comes when there will be some associated infections. What needs to be done, so we can have more impact on the overall death rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it should be on a large scale to offer tests for the disease to all persons who request it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to a private lab tests to do just that it was his friend, and despite his young age he had erupted also suffered from AIDS and Kaposi s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> &quot;Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they die, and they don&apos;t want to know anything else. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I have to die, I&apos;d better vyřádím three times a week,&quot; they say, but it&apos;s not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To this day, his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;I live a normal life like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, &quot;lists Fabrizio, who accepted an invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco that today, in the context of World AIDS Day motivated their testimony of those who are worried. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> &quot;Whatever they do tests. If the risk, so let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it&apos;s better. And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, they will be held accountable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This sums up his message to the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest gaps in the prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places, which is dedicated to this task &quot;is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Nejnáchylnějšími among the new infections are adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What do you want?&quot; Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical staff, adolescents want to avoid, says a reporter. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested this inefficient distribution change. Condoms are not just behind the counters, but the hundred dávkovačích whatever is in public restrooms, where young people often. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> &quot;It&apos;s not promoting promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> &quot;It&apos;s not to pay them a beer and a motel,&quot; as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Takovásexualita. The best is to make condoms to those who had sex life, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The key figures in the state of Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There have been 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and HIV-1, 317 cases). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> This is the fourth place in Mexico in the new and recorded cases of AIDS and the 13th place in the context of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of diseases in a sexual way, 6% of blood on the way y 2% perinatálně. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that can live with the HIV virus, about 50,000 people, because on the one registered case is four to five people who don&apos;t know about the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> The ruling by the court of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the company Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Therefore, it seems that the procedures of the restructuring of firms that allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The approval of a decision by 15 June last year, a judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves in practice the Mexican companies without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the ruling opens the door to the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First of all, it should be noted that while the judge in this case alleges that the creditors have to drive the Insolvency Act of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Firstly, it would suggest a lack of international legal cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, it was for this purpose, the United Nations created a model for the unification of international trade law, which specifies the organisation arbiter of the American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling states that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not have reached the required majority to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the possibility of Mexican laws allow. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which it was adopted this scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Technology. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> In addition, it is true that even after deducting branches would vote against the company Vitro creditors - who stood in court in the United States, i.e. the funds &quot;vultures,&quot; such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - not the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This figure does not take into account the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another point of view, blaming the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> In the meantime, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for reconsideration of the Court of Appeal to the examination was carried out with the full participation, with the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> If he fails here, will require a revision of the appeal process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> In this case, it is significant that the court failed to document sent to the Mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail the company Vitro under bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by the two countries that confronted the law with Chapter 15 of the insolvency of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Navícse points out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> The impact on both sides: The punishment for the company Vitro and the state. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The overall evaluation </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Unnoticed lay on the table a few months of criminal charges against the former owner of the aviation company Gastónu Azcárraga Andrademu, who was accused of fraud, and according to the pilots&apos; unions have already overflowed. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The panel, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineauem had filed a complaint to the National Banking and Securities Commission, which has accused of obstruction of justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to her, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic of transactions made by an entrepreneur, in which the bank IXE from fideikomisu F / 589 picked on behalf of the Mexican Aviation 198 million pesos. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds were likely to be directed to buy shares Professional hotel management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles). </seg>

<seg id="2867"> &quot;Héctor&quot; Hetin Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> &quot;The basketball world traveler Héctor&quot; Hetin Reyes was linked with this Salo sport more than 60 years and traveled to the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories on the history of the local basketball, as the &quot;Héctor&quot; Hetin Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Reyes was before he was caught by a stroke in 2008 in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the category, a player of the National Basketball League BSN, owner and trainer Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president Portorické basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I was in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League for BSN, general manager and president of the Federation of the national team,&quot; said Reyes when visiting reporters from the newspaper Primera Hora at his home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years, Isabel, his faithful wife. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes in his statement wasn&apos;t exaggerating. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenir of his long career, show it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the greatest affection of all are those that are reminiscent of his tenure at los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championships, either as the owner, the co-owner or trainer. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I got one playoff farewell - in 1981, when he made his debut in BSN Jerome Mincy. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Then the team took &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach, and by the time he was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me:&quot; I have a 6-foot player. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> I then recommended Bartow rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team, and one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to further. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship, when he played for the team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has pursued the basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he wanted to devote his functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> &quot;I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we left off, but we have a bronze, but for that of the Canadian panel, who let us repeat the final face-off, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> He is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we whippin team of the United States, which was quite similar to that we blew bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico Lopez and &quot;Piculína&quot; (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote&quot; Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of knee injuries. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team, which may not be perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquénu. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With the players on the roster, such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who had replaced the players ruled out because of the fighting in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won the gold. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> The number of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level of such results as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Not to mention his tenure in different leagues, where he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican coach? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The young, I very much like the work Leo Arilla. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> His success in the federation, is the biggest? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of that era&apos;s most famous national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s was National League BSN in one season to 17 teams. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you couldn&apos;t prove it? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to introduce, as the division of youth categories according to the regions. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the kids a lot of travel and play too many matches, which is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I also see benefits in the compulsory certification and training courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am pleased. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I&apos;m enjoying grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I&apos;m enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side. </seg>
