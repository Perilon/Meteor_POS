<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to hinder Obama&apos;s reelection </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justified its politics for the need to fight against the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now then, the Center Brennan considers a myth to be the above mentioned and affirms that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States that the number of persons who die because of the fall of a beam. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, the republican lawyers have not found any more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A thing is true: these new dispositions will affect negatively to the participation valuation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measurements will mine partly the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike what it happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in the same line most of the American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that were making difficult the process of inscription or of voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections of November, 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, during the year 2011 there interfered 180 projects of law that were restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws demand that the electorate should present an identity document with a photo, in addition to a test of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early vote, invalidate the right to register like elector in the day of the scrutiny and withdraw its right to vote from the citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no American state was demanding that the electorate should present an identity document with photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The State of Indiana was the first one in demanding it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For it, the republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last years these authorities have supported law projects in 34 states to force the electorate to present an identity document with photo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, unlike what it happens in Quebec, the American citizens have not a document of universal identity, like the card of the Social security. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11 % of the American citizens, that is to say, 21 million persons in age of voting, are not provided with any identity document with photo expressed by a government agency of its state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new electorate in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, the securing of the needed document of identity slope more than hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With which, the new restrictions affect in a disproportionate way the young people, the minorities and the persons with low income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In effect, 25 % of African Americans, 15 % of persons who gain less than 35.000 dollars a year, 18 % of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20 % of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years are not provided with an identity document with photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there is still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In many states the students, the electorate who more vote for the democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photo expressed by its institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states authorize the members of the clubs of fishing or of fighter who usually vote to the republican parties to use the documents expressed by the above mentioned clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no state was demanding the citizenship test to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state in presenting the above mentioned demand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen of the states has adopted laws that demand that the electorate should demonstrate that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measurements think about how, clearly, to limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It seems that two of every three Hispanic electorate support to the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, the republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that were abolishing the electorate inscription the same day of the scrutiny in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Also, they limited the right of the persons and the groups to creating a help service to the electorate who wanted to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the general election of 2004, the campaigns of inscription of the electorate contributed to the record of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measurements adopted from 2009 achieved that the valuation of inscription of new electorate was falling down in 2010 compared to the year 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Also, the republican legislators adopted laws in another five states that were favoring the reduction of the period of vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the elections of 2008 in Florida, 33 % of the electorate who voted in advance was African American, while the above mentioned were representing only 13 % of the electorate of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In case of the Hispanics the same happened exactly. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represent only 11 % of the electorate, what is equivalent to 24 % of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Nevertheless, the targets, which represent 76 % of the electorate, represent only 46 % of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic legislators and its followers have been opposed heartily to the adoption of laws that restrict the electorate record. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this sense, the democratic governors have blocked several law projects. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Attorney General&apos;s office of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was possible, partly, to limit the damages. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that was demanding the presentation of a document of identity with photo. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the new adopted rules will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws for that they have voted, since it is clear that with them one tries to influence the results of 2012 in the key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Center Brennan of 2011 demonstrates that the states that have adopted the above mentioned laws represent 171 of 270 necessary votes in the polling station to achieve the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too prompt to affirm with certainty if these legislative modifications will have a significant impact to electoral system scale in the results of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> A thing is true: these new dispositions will affect negatively to the participation valuation. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measurements will mine partly the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of the cancer of prostate: To do the test to him or not to do it to him? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In effect, the PSA test presents, sometimes, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to realize useless medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a motive more than sufficient to make to doubt the men, already reticent of for himself, if the detection tests should be done or not. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To do the test to him or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked two specialists for advice. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies realized in the United States a big contagions index was detected between the groups of sample, for what is difficult to interpret this information and to do firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For his part, the European study showed certain difference of mortality between the patients who had realized the detection and that not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, with a pursuit at the age of 12, demonstrated as well as it exists between 30 and 40 % of possibilities of suffering met√°stasis if the detection test has not been realized. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend, therefore, the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of African American origin have an index of higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take a good decision as soon as the cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is truly necessary to achieve that the patient understands the grade of risk of its cancer. All the possible options must be offered him and not necessary treat the cancers of prostate that do not commit an outrage against the long-term life, in whose case must be decided in favor rather of an active alertness of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Nowadays many men to whom a cancer has been detected are not treated, since the above mentioned cancer neither is aggressive nor contains a risk for its life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In its place, we suggest them an active alertness of the illness and, if this one progresses, we offer them a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> We determine every time with more frequency precise criteria to decide who should or not to be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend that the test to be done in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important that he speaks with its doctor to determine if the test must be done or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urolog√≠a, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and the contras of the test of PSA. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It is possible to unload this document (for the time being only in English, but translations will be offered soon) in the following direction: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prepare the illness </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, a miraculous recipe does not exist to prepare the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> In spite of the progresses of the investigations, the adoption of healthy habits of life there keep on being the best way of reducing the risks of suffering the illness. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We think that if everybody ate good and the sufficient thing was moving, 30 % of the cancers might get ready. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody was smoking, this valuation would rise, at least, up to 50 %&quot;, underlines Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Society against the Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, we evaluate that about 10 % of the cancers is hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others keep on being completely inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Society against the Cancer, the struggle against the nicotinism keeps on being a priority in spite of the decrease of the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The tobacco is linked by 85 % of the cases of the cancer of lung. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It constitutes, also, a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It harms enormously the health of the persons. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Presently, there are still 1,5 million smokers in Quebec&quot;, spokesman Andr√© Beaulieu declared. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging fact: 10 years, after stopping smoking, the risk dying of cancer comes down to the half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The corpulence and the obesity favor also the appearance of the illness, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risks of breast cancer, of colon and of rectum, of esophagus, of pancreas and of womb. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The investigations demonstrate that the regular physical activity practice during the whole life protects against the breast cancer&quot;, add. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organism recommends, the same way, to limit the consumption of red meats. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large numbers, they make to climb the risks of suffering a cancer colorrectal. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The pork butcher&apos;s shop products also must be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat for its smoked one, drying or salting can provoke the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the organism and lead to the development of the cancer&quot;, they tell to us. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In the last years, several scientists have studied the ties between the complexes vitam√≠nicos and the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Nevertheless, for the time being its investigations are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Seg√∫ the SCC, the studies about the vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While in one of them there was stated a decrease of the risks of cancer of prostate, in other what was observed it was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> D in the cancer it could not have determined the effect of the vitamin with clarity either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of speaking on the worries and the familiar precedents of each one with its doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;To do the detection test does not provoke cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> El bos√≥n de Higgs en detalle </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the bos√≥n of Higgs generated a big stir last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> One believes, in effect, that this bos√≥n is a participant of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything what exists in the universe, nothing more and neither more nor less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, it is a question of the particle which existence the standard model predicted: our better or &quot;less bad&quot; explanation of the nature and of the behavior of the matter, which still has not been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists it is not completely clear that it is a question of Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know undoubtedly that a new particle exists and that it looks alike very much to the bos√≥n of Higgs predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Also, new sleepless information this week in an important congress of physics celebrated in Kioto seems to confirm that yes it it is, although more information is still missing to be completely sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyhow, we suppose that it is a question of Higgs, since the possibilities of being wrong seem small. We will see of what it is a question. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this big world, a widespread and unavoidable law that it implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way of infringing this norm and do not try it too much, because it will end up by hurting itself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although the physics of the particles is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that also in her a law of these characteristics exists: the beginning of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; the &quot;state&quot; that consists, grosso way, of some of its characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The physicists classify the particles under two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On one hand we are with the good citizens called fermiones, which obey learnedly at the beginning of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And for other one there are the bosones, an anarchists&apos; dirty panda that does not take respect as anything, or at least not for this beginning, what means that they can be in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the web page The Particle Adventure of the Laboratories Berkeley who, certainly, is extraordinary, the bosones split into two groups: the inns, about which we will not speak here, and the &quot;particles of force&quot;, for which the big forces of the nature propagate and with which the Higgs bos√≥n would be of any form become related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosones, it would be necessary to underline here, there are no exotic bugs that we might believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bos√≥n: the photon or the &quot;particle of light&quot; that acts like &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In effect, when a particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;messes up&quot; the electromagnetic field in this precise environment; a little how when we throw a stone to a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;disorder&quot; an electromagnetic wave is born (of the light, of the infrared ones, of the ultraviolet ones, etc.), and this wave is not another thing than a photon; that is to say, one of the bosones &quot;bearers of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Stabler field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same happens with the bos√≥n of Higgs, with the difference that it is a question of another field, the field of Higgs, which needs to be &quot;messed up&quot; so that this bos√≥n appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now then, the Higgs field is much stabler than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it is necessary to come to extremely high energies, a little as if it was a question of a frozen pond on which only a thick rock could slide for the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For it it is necessary to have an immense particle accelerator as that of the CERN (the big hadrones colisionador is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all the particles neither nor all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some of them, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: piece of role, for example, the same clinging will never be supported for itself at the edge of an icebox. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And of the same form, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, certainly), they do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now then: what &quot;can all these investigations reach port&quot;?, asks Missis Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, also, that the physicists escrutinen the differences between the remarks and the predictions of the MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For his part, many people wish heartily to be, since the least difference might open a door to a &quot;new physicist&quot; that covers certain holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it is necessary to say it, has still enormous lacks, like which he does not propose any explanation relative to the gravity (ups!) or to the dark matter, which shape about 80 % of the matter of the Universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we have not found such differences in the CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Aftereffects </seg>
<seg id="137"> The aftereffects of the above mentioned investigations in ours every day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong on having said that it will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> So that they see: at the beginning of the 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories were not suspecting by no means the revolution that its works would provoke. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They were making the scientific applications out, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle said already, that Bell was employed at the laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that it prepared the first continuous laser (the first ones were touched) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered to be a &quot;device of laboratory&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And also, the applications can come also from the whole instrumentation that makes a detour to the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle prepared a light sensor in 1969 in the course of its investigation on the subject of optical. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not by no means its original intention, this sensor serves now as &quot;eye&quot; for all the digital devices of the world, what cost him the physics Nobel Prize in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC want to transform necessary our lives, but it is never known... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way of dying... | Him Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In its Commission to Die in dignity, Quebec debated recently the delicate question of the end of the life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be recaptured soon while a law project is prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Now then, inside this essential domain, there is still much that to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Him Devoir has tried to see it closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. he was living alone in its apartment of the Mont√©r√©gie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The cancer of prostate that was destroying him had given him a breather of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They had given me five years of life, but I already take this way seven&quot;, he reports, done a raisin, knocked down in its bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, to which the previous day came. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this&quot;, it continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The illness has caused him ravages: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going only to the bath and even eating himself. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat opposite to a tasty lunch, he accepts resigned that they help him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, he goes so far as even to smile, to speak with the strangers who dedicate attentions to him, they bring to him medicines and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The valor of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest desire is that they treat to me the diarrhea, it is humiliating&quot;, he confesses. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found remedy to this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man does standing pee&quot;, reports Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the center Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To return to its infancy, for certain persons, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the aptitude of the person to accept this retrogression&quot;, he states. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to the opinion about most of the persons who are employed at palliative care, the big moments take place in the heart itself of this retrogression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All the patients who enter the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois endure cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum prognosis of life of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In this state, the team of doctors and nurses who already surround them does not offer the &quot;curative&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of Mrs. A., of 89 years, it is to die &quot;conscious and drowned&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the illness has made him discover its children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a few good children&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I already have not left any more desires in this life&quot;, he says, before accepting that a mask is placed to help her to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And he waits, in the next days, for a last visit of its son who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois there is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and help to the feeding. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is palliative care that are given them when it is not possible to do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help to that its death is more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec we are provided with a bed of palliative care for every 11.700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little, since we know that we all will end up by dying some day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, the life continues in the best possible conditions, tells the Dra. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Be already at level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Mouth rinsings are offered to the moribund one with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Its sugar valuation already does not control the diabetics. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The death is part of the daily thing. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday in the night we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, its son finished the beer to the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help both the patients and its dears&quot;, reports Nathalie Savard, director of the care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without never being equal. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to a 94-year-old man who savors its last familiar meeting in the courtyard, good placed between its pillows while they all drink to its health, a 36-year-old young man dies of tragic form, surrounded by its parents, its wife and its two children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, there are always from three to five beds occupied by persons younger than 45 years sick with cancer&quot;, the Dra worries. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53 % of the patients who are admitted into the center Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from its house and 47 % of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of the access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77 % of the Canadians simply has no access to the palliative care, that is to say, to the care conceived to relieve the suffering when a patient comes to the terminal phase of its life, be in its domicile, in the hospital or in a center of care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisms, like the center Victor-Gadbois and the society of palliative care to domicile of Grand Montr√©al, specialize almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this big relative lack in the sanitary care of Quebec what does that many doctors specializing in palliative care are afraid of the adoption of a law that regulates the euthanasia and the assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> From October, a manifesto signed by eminences of the palliative care, like Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the Dra. Christiane Martel, the sanitary system of Quebec is not the sufficiently competent thing as to assure that anyone has a right to palliative quality care before it is accepted to proceed with the euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Recently&quot;, he reports, &quot;I have seen a patient spending 14 days in Urgencies suffering big pains without the necessary thing having been done to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the patients want to die alone because they do not receive the suitable care&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And in parallel, many oncologists are obstinate with its patients until the last day, in spite of the worst prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of H√©l√®ne Richard were already under minimums when it left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;When I said to my oncologist that he wanted to stop the treatment, she said to me that it was making him sad that he wanted to allow fighting&quot;, he reports. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;Nevertheless: she had said to me that there was nothing more to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> It has not taken care almighty </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Dra. Martel believes that 90 % of the patients that they request to die is grateful to its minders who have not attended to them in its demands once its pain has got better them thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it is necessary to say that the palliative care is not absolutely almighty as for treatment of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care to domicile of Grand Montr√©al, the patients do not answer to the treatments against the pain in 8 % of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of the life, the doctors usually resort to the palliative sedation, which serves to sleep to the patient until now of its death, perform already sporadic form or permanent form. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot feign that we do not understand this part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, not relieved illness is going to have the possibility of having this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The patients who are not relieved say all the same: &quot;I want to die&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But it does not mean that necessary &quot;I want the euthanasia&quot;, but &quot;I want that they relieve me&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The achievement of this reportage has been possible thanks to a scholarship of journalism of the institutes of investigation of health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals of big largeness in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day by day, what they know about a formidable &quot;system&quot;, of which politicians are part the construction industry, officials, trade union and mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that worked out too expensive for the taxpayers quebequenses, especially in the year 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It turns out to be curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted to the big means&quot;, ironiza Jacques Duchesneau delegated in Quebec and ancient chief of the Police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the explosion of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an investigation thoroughly on the embezzlements tied for contracts of highways in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of this moment, Jean Charest, had not withstood any more than in being late. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; established a direct tie between the industry, the clandestine financing of the parties and the corruption between officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transports department would have saved billion dollars in contracts&quot;, containing some of its instincts of remaining with a proportional part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;it has already made to fall down to two mayors&quot;, it adds, while he hopes to be able to go so far as to &quot;to demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent unit anticorruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent Unit anticorruption, created in 2011, is applied also with its team of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit works in addition to the police officers of &quot;the square Marteau&quot;, who, from 2009, have done that &quot;c√°rtel of the sewerage&quot; of Montreal it is moderated at the time of inflating contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> The above mentioned weeks, the unit has proceeded to the record in series of the accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next one of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from its mayor&apos;s position of Laval, third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> There have been accused formally engineers of the road network of Montreal and to businessmen of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last one has caused stir on having explained to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of securing of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid himself for three years 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary tied to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montr√©al, the party of mayor G√©rald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. Zambito distributed money to skillful and sinister during the year 2000, granting more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in the power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> It admitted, the same way, to have organized a collection of illegal funds for ex-viceprimera liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The inflation of the cost of the contracts of sewerage </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the corruption &quot;system&quot; worked with efficacy. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, exengineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years it got gifts, invitations to trips, tournaments of golf, restaurants, departed from hockey and bribes of companies of the sector of the construction for a whole for 736.000 dollars, all this in exchange for contracts of sewerage which costs it inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating the invoices between 30 % and 40 % by way of false extra. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Also, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused to M. Tremblay of having done the fat sight deliberately to a parallel budget and it filled its arks of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Immediately after these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November and led to Montreal to an enormous crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elect politics of Montreal that made dream the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayoress of the district of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, in the East of the island, was opposed from 2010 to the sale of a municipal area acquired by 5 million dollars and resold by 1,6 millions to the promoters in full real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70 % of the money of the election campaigns was a dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> Of the investigation that finally will be carried out, she makes sure that she pulls &quot;a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to catch the culprits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> And he adds that the process is &quot;painful, but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but it would be necessary to have a unit of clean investigation in Montreal and to be very alert so that the doubtful practices do not recur. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to do the cleanliness. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau for his part, declares that &quot;the officials have stolen hundreds of million dollars&quot;, but it is anxious especially for the role of &apos;&quot;elect politicians to the current of the stratagem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating in 70 % the proportion of dirty money that was assined to the election campaigns financing in Quebec, ironiza: &quot;they have said to me that this is only a pale reflex of the reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government quebequ√©s proposes to limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;while the electoral expenses do not limit themselves definitely, there will be dirty money in the politics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> He praises a finished review of the system of granting of public contracts and of financing of the parties: &quot;we cannot fall down any more down; to go to the fund of the things, with valor, to we will allow to reconstruct the house with a few more solid bases, with more control panel and laws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history steams up the international image of Quebec and of Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This period has acquired a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How would this advance explain? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It might explain for an individual realization, but also for the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Big players have come. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I advance from day to day next to you. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical personnel also has contributed me very much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And these elements push me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a party, that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything goes very rapidly in the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not get hot. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From my beginning in the center of preformation of INF Clairefontaine up to my step along Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to massive steps. </seg>
<seg id="262"> It is going to obtain benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Recruited of this summer they are used to disputing parties of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That does that a player as I want to fight and to give everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes me very much as for my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is endorsed by enclosures like Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as I. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires I respect all the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Presently, there is equal nobody in the League 1 and it is between the best European trainers. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has a big experience and has gained numerous qualifications with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> It has worked with big players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I believe that it will take other qualifications in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had a very comforting conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just gone out of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The faith that it has in me he explains also my good yield. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What does the PSG think on about the first part of the period? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the League 1, Lyons has taken the leader&apos;s position from us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we continue in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our biggest targets is the League of champions: we have qualified for the end eighth ones with style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the target of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to come further possibly. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, it can spend any thing. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have much that to say opposite to many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want, to start, to finish the first ones of our league opposite to the Oporto to be able to receive the return of eighth of end. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG turn into a big short-term European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To turn into a big European club, Paris has to gain qualifications and be there long-term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Presently, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> At economic level, the PSG is dedicated to its means so that this project materializes. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to gain the glass in the League 1, as in the last period: would it constitute a big defeat? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking this champions&apos; title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last period we do not come far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May we take a disappointment, since we were provided with the ideal conditions to end the first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong period. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We end with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points we should have been champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, the Montpellier, had a better enough period. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I believe that it will be the good one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams as the Marseilles, the Lyons and the Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we are provided with the weapon to take it to us. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Does he believe that the means wait for more of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that they hope much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We have accepted it completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After we were gaining 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still meet things that to reproach us is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what more the people wait. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to gain 4-0 all the weekends. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to start a game project. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is constructed by time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the League of champions we have demonstrated that we can answer and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look to the Manchester City that, after two periods, has not managed to qualify for eighth of end, and they also have invested very much! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Considering the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 advantage points to the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyons and Marseilles, which were not well the previous period, have turned out to be &quot;impelled&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> That demonstrates that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we could say with a smile that, in spite of all the difficulties, we have ended up by taking the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems completely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better that we say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that it scores many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It has come to demonstrate that the star of the League is 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And it has demonstrated in all the teams for which it has happened that he is a big player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men that he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What it has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes that to the others to increase its game level. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Miscellany, one of the best defenders of the world, allows also all to progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you lived through the Euroglass 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was much filled with enthusiasm for taking part in this Euroglass. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and went out reinforced. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I manage to play good parties in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is for what he was waiting from my baptism with the &quot;bleus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson from what it went on in Ukraine and to it it owes to itself that today we have a model behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the &quot;bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is obtaining turned out. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are quite placed in the group of classification for the World cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is rigorous, near to the players and he inspires to win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Since it was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to do comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved its target to qualify for the Euroglass. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps should lead to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to sit the bases? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game placed trust in us. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each one fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, he had not lived through a game seemed in all my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, to pay and to sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Everything opposite to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, the identified deals and the charges of prosecution between the parts. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Also, since often it happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system consisted of bank monopolies, leads to the financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonymic one), is simultaneously a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol of sure change like BitTorrent, which allows the files exchange on an equal footing. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Nearly 200.000 deals have registered thanks to 15.000 computers of the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And close to approximately thousand web sites they accept the bitcoins as donations or like form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The quotation of the bitcoin, after having come to the top for 30 dollars (23 euros) in June, 2011, fell down to 2 dollars five months later, before today being again about ten dollars (the quotations are registered on the page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> It is not impressive at all if we compare it with the world changes in real currency or in financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (BCE) was interested by him by a report on the virtual coins published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> In him, the bitcoin was described like &quot;the virtual currency with more success&quot;, &quot;that competes with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional coins&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins like the &quot;credits&quot;, used for advancing in a v√≠deojuego and that can earn playing or can be bought (and even sometimes to exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook developed also this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But in any exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the bitcoin, all the network nodes are simultaneously treasurers of books of accounting, checkers, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network work? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every deal between two users is done in fact between two electronic directions in the shape of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user can choose a different direction for every payment, guaranteeing this way the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of informations tied to this deal is signed electronically across a coding system to key double. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify this way the authenticity of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to assure that the changes of bitcoins should be clear in the public account book, that it spreads for the whole network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone consists of writing this new deal in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This raisin for the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown to the computers and the winner, a species of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this complementary line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a question of a phase of troceado of file, that is to say, of transformation of a big file in the shorter and only numerical trace. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; the new deal and add a number before &quot;trocear&quot; the set. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The target is to find the number that offers a particular trace (more zeros at first). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is, other nodes verify easily that is the good one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The deal is indestructibly tied then to the chain of sets of other deals; any modification would change the trace. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay two times with the same very rapid money (in less than ten minutes), the network only would accept like valid one of two deals; other one would remain an orphan, since both have different traces. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid the inflation, this reward splits into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited, then, to 21 millions, but they are divisible up to the hundred millionth one, what leaves a wide margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is revealed also in every increase of the potency of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have been stolen bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used mistake does not affect to the same protocol&quot;, makes sure Pierre Noizat, who has just thrown Paymium, a company of payment in real currency that uses the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The BCE bears in mind also the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The actors of weight as Wikipedia push the payments of this type back. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the platform Wordpress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that close to 80 % of bitcoins it does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November the &quot;giant reductions&quot; were thrown. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;30.000 dollars changed&quot;, there is glad Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns the bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to in the deals network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or to a payment for mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the deals, which this way go out cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The bearer, also, manages its identity and can remain, therefore, in the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to start in the commerce, which do not have to install new terminals not softwares. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough to them to give a direction that a phone could &quot;photograph and recognize&quot;, adds Pierre Noizat, who assures to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of review of the hierarchic systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will be necessary to have a time so that Bitcoin sets on himself, but in 2013 there might be a change&quot;, he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> On the other hand, in its report the BCE he foresees to revalue the diverse risks, today considered to be high, in case this currency is successful. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have gone out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And later? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left its responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> The NATO and the Americans must go out at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to recapture possession of its territory and that the Afghan ones choose its future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished especially the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered to be terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And to ourselves, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more the injured men and the cripples. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The talibans are provided with foreign extremists and ancient refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who push back the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviet ones. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend its traditions, ancient and archaic, even if to its causes there join the yihadistas, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, Uzbeks or the tayikos. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes even helped by the local insurgents, these it will not be already when the western ones become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The game of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the planted almond trees hills thanks to the French credits, was done by order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and of tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by the helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will not be talibans inflow in Kabul from ends of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed from its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was gap of that time and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different features. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Its capture of control of the country had been perceived as a liberation species, the return to the safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan ones have paid the price of the obscurantism of its peasants exceeded by the organization Al-Qaeda, but its situation is not a better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old men muyahidines, the current government and the current talibans share the desire to maintain the women in a low position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main personalities of the antiSoviet war returned to the power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into speculators, being done by governmental areas to resell them like lots for the refugees who have returned of Iran and Pakistan, benefiting along with enormous American subcontracting contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; most of them have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people wants to leave, as also there will go away those who have been able to take advantage of the American generosity: the capital escape is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people is tired of the war and of its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived through the modern world during its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With about 65 % of its population younger than 25 years, Kabul is provided right now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the entire population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the state schools are full so much of girls as of children. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will be necessary to give work to this young people who will want to return neither to the obscurantism of the ancient parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> They all, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. The television and its Turkish newspaper serials that present a modern world has big admirers in the whole country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will be considered to be legitimate the authorities that want to direct the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The ancient commanders of the antiSoviet struggle worry already about re-constituting the provincial militias, which will flee of the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization to image of the western nations. Nevertheless, the United States have wanted to transform it into the centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister who existed from the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The president Karzai does not want the foreign control, in particular owing to the elections foreseen in April, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Nevertheless, its country depends on the foreign help from the 50s and even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has re-established its services, has not managed any reservoir the important irrigation systems nor have been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported and it does not produce except at all fruits and vegetables to itself. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to the private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, the government control would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> There expanded the rumor of which Afghanistan was possessing immense mining wealths. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that did not do any more that to increase the feeling of which the western ones were there to take possession of them. </seg>

<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided that as for the constitutional declaration, which grants him provisionally full powers, he never decided to play everything for everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> It took everybody for surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text on the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Only one week ago, the head of state had given two more months to the above mentioned Assembly to finish its works. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And almost it has been two years since Egypt uses a provisional, several times modified text, what debilitates the institutional stability and leads to judicial entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has not done any more that to increase the break in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For its opponents, the president perseveres in its &quot;autocratic frenzy&quot; and continues &quot;betraying its word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the part of its followers, he makes sure that it is a question of a measurement to finish more rapid with the institutional and political crisis and to accelerate the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days a referendum should be organized. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A space of very short time that forces the Brothers to resign to its project to explain the text, article for article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the president, it is a question also of a form of recovering a popular and democratic legitimization while the polemic causes ravages in the whole country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in its favor, as he affirmed in an interview to the American weekly paper Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Thinking that this resource has been voted by a lot of rapidity, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: &quot;or they vote for my text or I maintain the full powers&quot;, powers that supposedly will come to its end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange ambience in which 85 members of this Constituent, Islamist Assembly in its majority, he voted for the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the liberals did not come to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In the middle of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they were thinking that they could not make cost its points of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights, the religious minorities and of the civil society did the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order that the necessary quorum should achieve, yesterday morning one added 11 persons, members substitutes, as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some of them are very near to the Moslem Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Since it was necessary to wait, the adopted articles it have been for unanimity. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It does grace to the commentators, on the other hand, the fact that one of few discrepancies of the day has expressed itself practically at the time of the prayer, so much it is so several members of the committee went so far as to think that the clock of the Constituent was badly. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which last night was still been voted, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The article 2, I object of all the looks, it keeps on being finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which was stipulating that &quot;the beginning of the Sharia constitutes the main source of the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> The parties salafistas, for whom the establishment of the Islamic law is a fundamental claim, were hoping that &quot;the beginning&quot; should be replaced with &quot;the norms&quot;, what had allowed a more strict application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamist ones, that this article has not been modified it is a guarantee of its good will and of its respect towards other components of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> The liberals correct it of hypocrisy and think that it does not talk each other any more than of an advertizing trick. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done across other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They refer, especially, to the article 220, which awards the University Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular for any that one who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, turns out to be worrying because &quot;the named people to declare itself are not chosen and do not have any democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the liberals turn out to be also increased by the fact that the next rector of the above mentioned university would be less moderate enough than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution we are in the frame of the marital status. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who exist being employed at this text are not ulemas but university students, any of them formed in the French system&quot;, tells Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he admits that there can be certain ambiguity concerning the article 220, since the used terms imitate the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> &quot;We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question that might appear in the future would be to what extent they are the competent civil judges to be pronounced over all this&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received a lot of criticism that refer to the widespread powers that he awards to the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Moslem Brothers will allege that they are small compared to those who were during the previous diet. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another difficult point: the powers awarded to the army. </seg>

<seg id="493"> Neither the prosecutions will be prohibited of civil in military courts, as were asking the associations for the defense of the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> These also showed its worries relative to the text, which they consider liberticida. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The blasphemy crime is supported and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, what might transport serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially that of the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Also, no article emphasizes the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, it the only positive has been the prohibition of the torture in accordance with the article 36. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The big and powerful one&quot; will take you up to Moscow: immigrants save for the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While deputies and defenders of the human rights discuss the consequences that the law would bring on the obligatory examination, already there have appeared in the country sharks who trade with &quot;false&quot; certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million immigrant workpeople come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Mostly they are citizens of countries of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Its only purpose is to gain money to help its families that have remained at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> From December 1 there comes into force a law, according to which every labor immigrant will have to realize an examination to verify its knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the time being, this rule is applicable only for those that have the intention of being employed at the sector of rendering of service, institutions of community services, domestic services and I trade retail. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Nevertheless, with the time, as they promise in the Federal Service of Immigration, the examinations will become obligatory for all the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Also, it will not be sufficient in spite of producing the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of essentials of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It will have to confirm the knowledge of the language even to receive and to renew the green card. </seg>
<seg id="596"> There are an exception the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> There will not be subject to this law the persons who managed to obtain its certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Utility, fatality and defense of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The centers network examiners will work protected by the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of the Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of Saint Petersburg and other Russian institutions of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The immigrants will be able to present themselves to the tests in all the cities, right now in Russia there are opened more than 160 centers of this type. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Service of Immigration. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But the defenders of the rights, long before the law it will come into force, they managed to ask often this question to the press: And what will contribute this in fact? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will be brought by the obligatory nature of the knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for the proper immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, answer the representatives of the Service of Immigration, this will allow to reduce the number of persons who suffer &quot;labor slavery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people speak today on the defense of the rights of the labor immigrants, tells V√≠ctor Sebelev, chief of the representation of the Federal Service of Immigration of Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defense of its rights must begin before its game. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only one system of organized selection will allow to solve the problem of the immigrant workpeople in 90 % of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems have the immigrants without profession, education, which neither know the language nor spend the medical control. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the comprehension of the language, he affirms that Sebelev, the future immigrant will see convicted to find persons without conscience that, on the pretext of helping, put one &quot;viajecito paid&quot; to a horrifying and narrow small cave, where he and dozens of others as he boil away for months without meal or documents, working from 12 until 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive a sinn√∫mero of complaints of our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In its homeland they promise them a thing, but on having come, they are cheated, they are deprived of its passports, they do not pay the engaged wages to them&quot;, confirms the Chief of the Direction of labor immigration of the Service of immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Do not get angry, jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, meanwhile many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who want to work in Russia admit that not only they do not know the language of the country to which they try to go, but also in its own language they write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much its fault but its own misfortune: there are small the turkmenos, Uzbeks, tayikos that could give themselves the luxury of receiving normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is due to the fact that its families even do not have anything that to feed the children, them for not speaking already of dressing, of wearing them and to buy to them the necessary thing for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> On having come to the adolescence, these boys risk to work to the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if the language is not known, they recognize. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;One feels humiliated and low&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Nevertheless, as for the law on the language, the defenders of the rights indicate an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they do not have this status, there will not be not even examination and, consequently, any official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, most of the immigrant workpeople keep on living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or prohibited the step to strangers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors affirm that to receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Also, the legalization costs money: of twelve thousand to sixteen thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> Nevertheless, a false inscription can be done quickly and for only thousand five hundred roubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The personnel of the Russian police knows that generally we take false documents, we are not inscribed and the cases of extortion appear. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us for hundred or two hundred roubles for cigarets or tea&quot;, mentioned to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;We go, do not be stingy, buy a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> The first day of the coming into effect of the law on the language, revealed that not only the documents of immigrants&apos; record can be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;false&quot; certificates of knowledge of the language have been already seized by officials of the Federal Service of Immigration. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The falsified documents had been printed on printers color standard. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not like gift: every immigrant, queri√©ndose to facilitate the task of spending the tests, paid for the document seven thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is a two times and way more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost to the immigrant worker three thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for a next future is to protect the system against the corruption so that the &quot;diplomas&quot; could not be bought, there converge the officials of the government and the defenders of the rights. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Until now, the authorities can promise to the immigrant workpeople who could not have spent successfully the examination the first time more time to study the basic course of the language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Also, to the immigrants who do not speak Russian there will be offered works that do not need active communication with the persons. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Department of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal commerce of weapon </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapon is quite limited </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Department of the Interior proposes to apply the law with major rigidity as regards the owners of weapon of civil use. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: To press shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Muscovite lawyer Dimitri Vinogr√°dov, in which to Be too tight seven persons lost the life. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the use and the possession of traumatic weapon in public places and raise the minimal age for the license securing to carry weapon, from 18 years to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the chief of the committee of the Duma on the subject of safety and struggle against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession weapon will be taken to the Duma of the State in a next future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> They not all feel satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to resist this problem applying the &quot;politics of hard hand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> In the network there has appeared an open letter, which authors, representatives of diverse social organizations of knobs, demand that one desists from such measurements of &quot;meaningless rigorousness&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of registered weapon is minimal, he mentioned to the service of news BBC of Russia, the pleaded criminologist Vasiliy L√©snikov. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics of the Department of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, opposite to the whole of 1168 crimes registered for the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that a more strict legislation in the sector of weapon of civil use will not be a disadvantage so that the delinquent goes to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, according to its words, in Moscow it is possible to find any cheap weapon. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, in the Department of the Interior one affirms that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapon is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Providers: from factories up to officials </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black weapon market stocks up across several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are years, says the retired colonel V√≠ctor Baranets, who for ten years was employed at the Department of Education and at the High staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Apprehension of screen of the web site that accepts weapon orders </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first one, &quot;trace of the army or military man&quot;, that is to say, the weapon that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapon was stolen by the Russian officials and by the same Caucasians&quot;, says Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The following type of &quot;black weapon&quot;, the stolen ones by delinquents and representatives of the securities force. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets tells that here there are included the stolen weapon of the stores of the police and those stolen straight by officials of the organs of observance of the law. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal weapon goes on sale from the military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military arsenals often there were explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There exist demonstrated versions of which some fires were provoked with premeditation to cover the absence&quot;, mentions an exmilitary man. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, the weapon manufacturers also put its sand granite. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now there have proliferated factories deprived of weapon that are not competitive on the international market and weapon distributes under rope to the black, included market that of Moscow&quot;, says the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One more source of the black market is the contraband. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Large number of guns and machine guns comes from poor countries as Kirguist√°n. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There they are provided with their own production, sometimes handmade, and there has formed a mafia that has organized the weapon flow&quot;, tells the ex-military man. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where from does the weapon come? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapon to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center of analysis of problems and planning of the public management. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The specialists analyzed reports of the Department of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminological bibliography and information of public access of portals which subject-matter turns concerning the weapon. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The majority of the illegal weapon, according to the investigators, comes from the armed forces and from the securities force. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapon of the black market has come there &quot;through the fault of officials whose work is related to the weapon&quot;, it is said in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the investigators, 17 % of the weapon comes from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 % of the cases is stolen during the weapon production and 5 % corresponds to the &quot;illegal archaeology&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The clerk of one of the shops of weapon, who asked that its surname be not mentioned, says that nobody buys the weapon found by illegal excavators for already a lot of time because they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he says, the providers go to military stores when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Across some second lieutenant, the provider buys a unit, for example a gun TT. </seg>
<seg id="678"> They eliminate it of the record and spend it over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;This one takes the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euros for unit with two loaders&quot;, it tells us </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;But, skylight, the these police to so much of all the matters, so periodically, when it is necessary to fulfill the plan of discovery of crimes, they realize test buys to the merchants of illegal weapon&quot;, adds the clerk. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in one luxurious boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are usually across acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform &quot;Begovaya&quot;, where there would be a man who would take me to an &quot;esquinita&quot; where we might negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="684"> Of the price of the weapon, I found out only there&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Military commentator Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="686"> &quot;To obtain a weapon a friend needed that it has contacts&quot;, says the clerk of the shop. &quot;I have a friend like that, but I do not trust very much in him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="687"> On the markets there are sellers, but there also it is necessary to come, let&apos;s say &quot;on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him that to say to him him a tooth had fallen down to its daughter&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> I even can obtain a pair of oven gloves of steel across a confidence person. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He also gives them me only because he knows that I am not going to denounce him. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The beginners look for weapon in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The ex-military man Viktor Baranets put himself to the test in the buyer&apos;s role of illegal weapon in the middle of the year 1990, when he was preparing to publish an article about this topic. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes, according to its words, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> They delivered to him an album of photos where there was not &quot;of everything&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt as in one luxurious boutique&quot;, remembers the military man. </seg>
<seg id="695"> According to Baranets words, they do not offer cat to the buyer for hare: everything what exists can be proved. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, like potential client, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon shoots well, we begin to negotiate&quot;, the expert describes the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Couches shop </seg>
<seg id="699"> The engines of web search lead places and groups of &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, where it is offered to buy weapon &quot;for different intentions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For this either any document nor personal meetings are needed. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It is sufficient to have a certain money quantity&quot;, they write in the title of the advertizing notice &quot;to Buy a gun or a machine gun&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="702"> There the users do its orders and put questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And do they sell age minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Without permission, of course&quot;, he asks the user &quot;Iv√°n&quot; (preserved spelling). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;I buy gun TT. Moscow&quot;, laconically it formulates its question &quot;Fedorenkov&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Service of Safety has created an enormous network of fictitious web sites and captures to two hands those who want to buy firearms. </seg>
<seg id="707"> And the people go, like hungry fish towards the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> military commentator and exmilitary Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard to speak about these systems: in general, the web site is registered out of the scope of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The people do the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer realizes the payment across a cash dispenser. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In answer, they send to him a photo and the instructions so that he knows where the weapon is secret&quot;, reports the secretary of press of the ONG &quot;The right to the weapon&quot;, Dmitri Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets affirms that if an order is done in line, one remains without weapon and they put it in the jail. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Service of Safety has created an enormous network of fictitious web sites and captures to two hands those who want to buy firearms. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;And the people go, like hungry fish towards the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> In the buy of illegal firearms, according to the experts, one one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislov of the ONG &quot;The right to the weapon&quot;, a gun Makarov can be acquired by 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It will have to wait for one month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> It is sent from the military stores by the chiefs of average status. </seg>
<seg id="721"> In accordance with the official statistics of the department, compared to the period in January - October, 2011, the entire number of these crimes in Russia diminished in 7 %, what constitutes 22.900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapon, ammunitions, explosives and explosive gadgetry diminished in 7,8 %. </seg>
<seg id="722"> There put themselves in strike the personnel of restaurants of fast food and supermarkets in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to the fourth part of American adolescents they find its first works as tellers in &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last days, in the United States a protests wave has begun against the low wages that are paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of fast food, such as &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Block Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the time being nobody dares to affirm if it will come or wave is not to nine points, or if it has destined to lose forces and to be tamed in its first stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The actions of protest are provided with the support of the trade unions and of a series of ONG of lefts. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of the modest wages perceived by the workpeople of Walmart and those of the system of fast food, the target of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workpeople in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For the time being, this sector of the economy practically has not been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Forty six cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving Day, the called &quot;Black Friday&quot;. This day, in the United States coomenzaba the bacchanal of reductions that captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> This day, some workpeople of the corporation Walmart, which uses 2,2 million persons in the world, left its jobs and formed protest pickets along with the trade unions and lefts activists in the shops of the corporation, which products speak to persons of modest and moderate income. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells of everything, from nappies, rifles of fighter and batteries for cars, up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its shops are of average between 8 % and 27 % cheaper than those of the biggest supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That&apos;s why many workers badly full of Walmart buy only in the work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and the choice of products have done of Walmart one of the biggest corporations of America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words two critics, Walmart can allow himself the luxury of selling products at very low price, partly because he pays little to its workpeople. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The above mentioned also complain about the bad labor, such conditions as the absence of hoist or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> This &quot;Black Friday&quot; the participants of the declaration demanded the wages increase and complained about that the cost of the insurance of health provided by the corporation spent from 30 to 100 monthly dollars. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives 9,5 dollars per hour, this expense is excessive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists of the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to 12$ per hour, this will cost him to the corporation 3,2 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately one more 1,1 % of what it spends in wages now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart places the wage rise in the shoulders of the consumers, every visit to the shop will turn out to be to them only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In one year they will spend the ridiculous quantity for 12,39 more dollars of what they spend now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The followers of Walmart mention satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> On the &quot;Black Friday&quot; it extended in its shops from 8 p.m. until the midnight of the following day and, during this time, Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In whole, its cash registers realized the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million deals. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the web site of lefts Huffington Post, that they left its job &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart personnel and that the protest had not been any more than &quot;another trick of public relations&quot;, organized by the workpeople trade union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free box!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, in that the targets were not precisely the department stores Walmart (that in this progressive city have no theirs appreciation, and that&apos;s why for the time being there is not any), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that it sells thousands of million portions, and then they do not even grant the sick leave to you and do not pay away from you for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, member of the Town council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, in accordance with the federal law and that of New York, the minimum wage is of 7,25$ per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast food restaurants are increasing it with the time, but only lightly, and of average, the ordinary workpeople receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody wins less than they in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with this money, for me is something incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost the fourth part of the American adolescents were happening for the McDonald&apos;s and were working there, behind the counters, part-time after the school, although they were still living with its parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few ones were those who saw this like the main source of income or they will glide to remain there a lot of time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly I stumble in some interviews with workpeople of McDonald&apos;s who complain about that have to live of this salary, and sometimes enclosed to feed its children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment which author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know with what feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants in the protests, which Street and Madison Avenue began at 6:30 a.m. in the McDonald&apos;s of 40th, demanded that the tellers and cooks of fast food should be begun paying at least 15$ per hour, or, that one duplicates its current minimum wage to them. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Also they demanded that in the sector of the fast food workpeople trade unions believe. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The law of the USA prohibits the administration to prevent this right and to punish the activists of the trade union movement with cunning arguments and dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, rarely the administration facilitates the life to them. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy that the trade unions include the meal sector r√°pid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the personnel. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place to half of the meeting in the McDonald&apos;s placed close to Times Square, in which there took part several local democratic politicians, in particular member of the Town council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says that it is selling thousands of million portions, and then even it neither gives you a hospital he does not even pay away from you for your honest work&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators received the support of other out-standing democrats of New York, for example from the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must support the workpeople of the sector of fast food so that they manage to receive just wages and the economic prosperity that every neoyorkino deserves&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Since the periodic New York described it Steal, this has been the biggest declaration of this type in the American history of the fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But in her a few hundreds of persons took part only, not all of them were even used of the fast food service, in that trabakan tens thousands of persons of New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is still not clear if this will serve as spark to provoke a massive movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the time being, to cheat to the brain does not turn out to be so easy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The topic of developing, so popular reality between the fans of the modern technologies, lately is perceived by normality principally across the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> To summer beginnings, in its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had presented also a request to protest the clear correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Nevertheless, of a conversation with the chief of the group of interactive technology 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of the above mentioned company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with the naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please, in general terms: what is the object of study of its group of investigation? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We devote ourselves to the interaction person - computer, but also we try to extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For the time being the humanity in its big mass has remained caught in the work stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes it touches it with the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years forward and foresee the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the console Xbox and the sensors Kinect represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox sells without Kinect, since they all are interested in the control for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What more provides the future to us? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect has taken the interaction at the physical level, big part of this one still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The information introduction has improved (the system receives more information), and the exit is not yet very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, are employed at truly three-dimensional, based visualization systems ‚Äã‚Äã in different technologies, including those of design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to liberate the world of the computer science to ours, to the physicist, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, nevertheless, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects of a more comfortable form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First of all: to the devil with these dumb helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think on the control for voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A very popular detail, but: does not he believe that they overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It is clear that it is not possible to consider him to be a panacea, it remains hanging of solving the privacy question, since not always one wants that the others find out about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but each one in their own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the devices control in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not in free, but shorter movements. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Also, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but for a bracelet that was registering the movement of the bones and the muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For the time being it is very big, but theoretically it can be limited to the size of a clock of bracelet. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How is this? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example: how would you ask me who should spend this soda canister to him? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will speak and it will show it at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Or, do you want to force the users to adapt yourself to what can or cannot do in this moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessary, but it is a mutual approach. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that in a next future we are going to have to be employed principally at the design of new types of sensors that could determine exactly the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example, sensors laser, since they provide a good resolution in depth, what is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we speak about its work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect: what complaints do you have of the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do they lack resolution, depth or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to obtain 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the counterfoil and in the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not it sufficiently good for us; this gives more work to the algorithms designers. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Or, that we have to remember not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also there is important the speed, the number of pictures per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The human movements are the quite dynamic and the current ones of 30 fps they are truly scarce, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, did a contact sensor with adaptable prosecution delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is necessary to mention that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not the whole world understands to what extent this affects to the human machine interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> There would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not need contact so that the pictures per second are more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And is not it necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect has now three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared beams and the second the recipient of the reflected sign. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is in fact a simple sensor of the visible diapason. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This one is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, more cameras quantity they might solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or on the contrary, to increase it and to increase the quantity needed from calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a similar Kinect electric cord, to play with the curvature of place of the cameras and to see how this would help to determinr the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Since I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, it has not presented its glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Does not it seem to him that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of developing reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, to spend the whole moment supporting in high place an intelligent phone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a developing reality &quot;transmutable&quot; when, in base of a platform of cloud, you might go on from the glasses to the intelligent phone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, in that there is its force (the private things only you will be able to see them), but also its weakness: a developing reality based on glasses will not allow him to work on virtual objects together with other persons. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagin√©monos for a moment that the objects manipulation hologr√°ficos virtual in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also for any simple mortal one. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem in this idea that the critics usually indicate: there is no tactile answer! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers does its group prepare for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my conferences often I say that the developing reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between the man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe that the eighth one well might be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Register the tact perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there exist also technologies that are truly faced to contribute tangibility to these &quot;images in the air&quot;. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed to a specific point where the finger is gives a sensation similar to the one that one feels if someone him was blowing in the egg yolks of the fingers, but this sensation is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets for the doll that influence in the nervous completions of the fingers, this also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Has it tried to cheat to the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think that he feels what seems that he should feel at the moment when it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not tried yet it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here one hides another challenge against which we will have to fight for the long time, how to do that a person physically located in a very limited space believes that it goes to an open space, almost without end. We are employed also at the idea of the tapes of running (not like those of the gymnasia), mobile platforms, as well as that of the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the time being, to cheat to the brain does not turn out to be so easy, it is still necessary to work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work attractive with the virtual reality for the investigators, that many things are in the state of entire conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;Vanguardismo of Saint Petersburg&quot;, devoted to the citizens who are ahead, to the avant-garde of the art and of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of the art and the scene of Saint Petersburg, which achievements come beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia knowing them at least. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is extravagant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a dressed bearded man of red of above below, which it is possible to find close to the Russian Museum, close to the summer Garden or in fashionable meetings and openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The pictures of Kirill Miller always attract to multitudes, where he wants that they are exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of these storytellers purely sociofil√≥sofos of Saint Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardismo of Saint Petersburg of ends of the 80 - beginning of the 90. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Also, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the awake city in the inhabitants smiles and he raises to all the frame of mind. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, it took in its hands a hurdy-gurdy and turned into the organ grinder of Saint Petersburg, since it has matured to be so difficult role, for its Bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill: why do you go for the city dressed of red and not of yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red color because I am a fashionable designer and devote myself to the appearance and to the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and the society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in the society, everything what is not a little gray causes aggressiveness and agitation of properties not good at all. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are directed that initiates a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions there are an invitation to the debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When did you understand that you had to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old not official artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, they were still unincluded. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I made artists&apos; friend of the new wave, with the later ones to those who were exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which went to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and the new wave was already finished. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sank in the theater for the clothes, the music of all the genres, but not for the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this joined in your art Clinic... - For me it was important to be in the cultural center of Saint Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to meet. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there existed a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian lifestyle of Saint Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many people were born there: Nonms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought to the project to &quot;The ear of Van Gogh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and its friends were singing light songs under phonogram, were dressing exact pants, between them fashionable composer Igor Vdovin was at present. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to touch in alive, it turned in &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was a quizmaster of many programs before the Hali-galivskih times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of its big career; the basic education and formation received it from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> A gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, the &quot;Club Griboyedov, there are the remains of the Clinic of the Art. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our personnel and assiduous clients were going. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of last century, when the culture was meaning something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was &quot;The people of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; it was me who was chosen, this way it finished my culmination. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man the one that likes the truth, the honesty and the culture of last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our times it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little refined. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - There is in your works something recognizable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and the occurrence expresses itself clearly. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to do a programmed exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a category atemporal. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I earlier was sociable, but now to be like that is painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns everything is daubed and the tragedy is eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque thing, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world by means of a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now they follow one for the clothes, being faced in the external thing, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps it should to this person neither do not even do not even to unite, but him to spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the trick will be eliminated when it changes of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Not long ago we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A refined city must have a hero like that. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than I it to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well but: perhaps can the commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnesses of the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Earlier the people were gathering together in herds, the Bohemians wanted a thing, the simpletons others. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now they all have split into microcommunities, it is difficult to like to all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket for hundred dollars we all like. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now it is necessary to think who wants to like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come for thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - The godforsaken ones are going to see it, there the sphere works social sex. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And 300 persons go to a cultural event, 10 thousand will never come. As turned out, less management, less money, everything withers. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to begin to lose what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When it was young it was doing such pictures that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which in general the people end. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often they confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, consumption culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> No culture exists in the consumption, this is another history. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the yesterday culture, I grew under the artists&apos; example through that they were living in the poverty and were dying in the poverty, they were refusing to the money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favor of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill: what is what he lacks to Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> A concept exists: official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can devote themselves to the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the kings were the correct ones everything was otherwise, the kings perhaps did not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to maintain the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow now there are very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have the people in Saint Petersburg that well they might be experts, but they are closed, because experts are needed at a top level that they evaluate correctly to these and open way to them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now the subjective personal taste is prospering. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not the whole modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - ¬øQu√© es p√°rrafo ti San Petersburgo? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital. In Moscow there is great more culture, there is area. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones it is difficult that the art grows. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural area and have now more writers that readership, this is badly. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe there are tons of people with curiosity that goes to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is negligible. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We have to do that the art is fashionable, as it it was at the beginning of last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be executed by a subsidy of Saint Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> To give birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Spaceships trailers with human beings on board set off in search of a planet of store. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To preserve the humanity asks the main question to herself: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or in the same planet of store? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is little where about choosing. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;These are Venus and Mars&quot;, says the investigative chief of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions in Mars are better for the life, in the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 grades. </seg>
<seg id="941"> It is possible only to live to big altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in the space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> One began to tackle the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> It has been half a century since experiments were already carried out with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas cultivated in orbit were not differing in anything of the terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Later the insects baby came in the orbit, small fruit flies, the dros√≥filas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 quail eggs were sent to the space to verify how the embryo develops in weightlessness conditions. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We obtain like turned out a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then they begin the problems. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is in that this chick has to find support, must be supported on its own feet and begin moving&quot;, tells Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="950"> On not having found support, the chicks were giving somersaults at random. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in the newborn babies an entire atrophy of the instincts happened. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were reacting neither to the light nor to the sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the misfortune was that after four days simply they were dying. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And two times we achieve that the chicks were born, but then we leave it because it was impossible to work there with them&quot;, mentions Vladimir Sychev on defeat of the experiment with the chicks in the space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time that a biological &quot;miniark&quot; demolished to the orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 they will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> Nevertheless, in the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; there will only travel species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were already sent to the space with fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was not supernatural at all. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was the only experiment, and studies since this one must be carried out&quot;, mentions Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the spatial rats had descent. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, it has not become possible to tackle the problem of the reproduction yet straight in the space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, on having lost its habitual habitat, simply cannot realize its sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, nevertheless, in contrast to the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and it is capable of creating a suitable emotional fund. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women travel to the space for already 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk spent his Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most valued thing that the humanity has is the feminine organism. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flying, and nobody in the Earth might say: if it is after a flight to the space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> It will be able or not to have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After everything, to this question nobody has answered&quot;, mentions the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June, 1964, only after a year from the flight to the space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who two times was in orbit and even was employed at the open space, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We are small, are told the astronauts to whom after long flights everything should have proved well, and a healthy generation has growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if it is possible to say more, it is dangerous enclosed in orbital flights&quot;, sums up the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Nevertheless, the humanity must look for some new routes in the biotechnology, in the radiological protection, in the creation of the artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hidrolaboratorio of the Center of cosmonauts&apos; preparation is an obligatory stage in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> In conditions of void flotabilidad, the cosmonauts practise its work skills in the space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a new-born child it is its native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small men - amphibians seem to confirm that the life in the ground arose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic liquid, since it will be easier to get accustomed then to the water to him. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of the birth until now from the first bath only 2 weeks go on. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little to forget something&quot;, says Marina Aksenova, monitor of swimming of newborn babies. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the weightlessness is the more natural state for a newborn baby, for the women there is necessary the gravitation, the force of the gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the weightlessness the abdominal muscles and of the pelvis decrepitan very rapid, the capacity of expulsion of the fetus diminishes. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Very well, we omit that, trusting in the action of stimulants for the childbearing. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is possible, of course, to give birth in a special camera, this one will push it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot;, Valeri Polyakov asks this original question to himself. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the gravity sensation, the organism generates neither the skeleton nor the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In orbit it is impossible to dress it in a special suit for trainings to a newborn baby, as to the adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Simply he will be deprived of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment that we are going to do together, on having allowed the birth of a child in a strange ambience, will give place to which we bring the Earth to a disabled one, to a completely maladjusted person&quot;, there foresees the chief of the committee of bioethics of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For the time being, the children&apos;s birth in the space is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Nevertheless, with the time this will be a reality, when the human beings in its ships go to a distant planet that will be the hearth for its children born in the space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Chief of NK√ö: The examination of the system &quot;varc&quot; it has not met on the guilty politician </seg>
<seg id="1002"> On the subject of public awarding, the Czech Republic is provided with good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application limps. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This way it is affirmed by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Office of Control (NK√ö) in an interview for Aktu√°ln ƒõ. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect&quot;, but its application must be correct. &quot;This is, in my opinion, what we lack&quot;, this way describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The joint control panel of the Czech and German inspectors also comes to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As example of an incorrect practice, it mentions the attitude of Petr Neƒças towards the system of being autonomous only on the role, which is known as the system &quot;varc&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The prime minister said recently that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother to the businessmen with inspectors. Then: is it prohibited or authorized? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be regulated somehow and if it prohibits something, in this case, not even the prime minister can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to realize the above mentioned control panel nor demand obligations&quot;, he states Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> In the meeting of the commission of control in the Congress of the Deputies, you spoke about the common project between the Czech team and German, in the frame of which there was compared the legislation regarding the public awarding in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What is exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a question of a parallel control that we begin realizing approximately two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Saying of a simplified way: the European legislation regularizes how the public awarding must be organized, to this he is followed by the current legislation in every country and, later, the praxis in himself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have joined everything and, although the control still has not finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is &quot;more strict and more finished&quot;, nevertheless, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It is confirmed, then, that it is not enough to incorporate more and more strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the law enforcement itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can contribute in fact this project? Which does he believe that there are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Precisely a common control of this type might contribute that we were stopping investing efforts in the concision of the laws, the reduction and the progress of the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of the saving means to obtain a thing adapted at a reasonable price (what not always means that the price is the lowest) to avoid this way the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not for the fact of reducing the limit of the awarding it means that we are going to obtain it. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated by so much &quot;paperwork&quot;, that those who want to look for mistakes in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits were staying so high as now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak about the problems of our country with the transference of the legislation that there regulates the pr√°cticaa of the public awarding. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control panel system work in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is it an office similar to our NK√ö or one organizes otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for the offices, like the NK√ö, there it operates the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school also, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but at first both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the competitions are to a certain extent anal√≥gas, nevertheless, while Germany has a federal organization, the account courts are enclosed at this level. In this aspect it differs lightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control the federal money, what here we call state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds, which are administered by the regions and the municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation: is it simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not like establishing a comparison without concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany keeps on being a model in some aspects, but it is not possible to be necessary with accuracy in what it is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Might it be better, for example, as for the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That sure that not, but, I repeat, I do not like doing this type of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face to a big number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If it was not like that, no benefit would suppose them to collaborate with our office: does not he believe? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As for the legislation of our country: what did the law amendment mean for its Office on the public awarding? Is its incidence evident somehow? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it still has not been evident in the control performances. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since we realize control panel ex-post, it is necessary to be provided with a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For the time being, it is observed in the process of preparation of the future control panel: we have initiated a new tool of &quot;detection of not economic risks&quot;, for which we have made to spend almost 14.000 public awarding, which have been analyzed. The changes will turn out to be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, there are rectified the conditions of some types of the process of selection and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Does he think that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, he supposes an entanglement for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is of course a step in the correct direction and I hope that this way it should be. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the regulation &quot;hardens&quot; and that it is impossible to fulfill it. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already with the previous regulation, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in case of the regional operative programs of the regional advice), and every law not respected on the subject of public awarding was meaning the violation of the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does make sense then to harden the law this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I believe that not this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude to those that want to attack it or to take advantage of him and not to punish those that commit a formal mistake, which has no influence in the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> A system of this type will only manage to create a major bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how does it leave of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We will see where it takes us this initiated way. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister has declared recently that the ODS would not bother to the businessmen with control panel of the called system varc, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on the role. What means this? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the system varc&quot; prohibited or authorized? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be regulated somehow and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office that has the obligation to realize the above mentioned control panel and to demand obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We change the law and allow it&quot;, but he cannot say that we will do as if not at all. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the law on the public awarding, the regulation is quite strict as for the way in which it is necessary to act formally. And this way it is like a debit to be to protect the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, he is a tragic actor who excludes the candidate with the best offer for not fulfilling the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The highways present ice badges, although mostly they are passable </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places of the Czech Republic the highways present badges of ice and of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Although most of the routes are passable, in someone the precaution must make a special effort. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Region of Karlovy Vary </seg>
<seg id="1058"> Today in the morning the highways in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but they were presenting badges of ice and of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperature descends and it will range between five and ten grades under zero. During the day they will raise lightly the thermometers. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> On the other hand, in the combs of the Metallic Mounts the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> In some places the visibility was still bad because of the fog, according to the information of the center of control of operations of the highways of the region. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The rapid route R6 and the highway of the first category in the region are now passable without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Nevertheless, it is recommended to carry to extremes the precaution, especially in some bridges which surface can be frozen and to be slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Also, also there are passable all the routes of the second and third category, including the mountain highways. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Nevertheless, in some of them there are still stretches with remains of ice and rolled snow. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> ≈† imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> It is said that in little less than one month the end of the world is going to come: what does he think about it? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one of between so many other alarmist news to which it likes seizing us. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The group of musician The Tap Tap us likes doing rather pranks on this and we like saying that we are the only group of music of the world that manages to assemble enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Also, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can it be explained to our readership? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a question of a state charitable act that we take gliding for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decide to make use of the potential of marketing that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, December 20 at 21 a.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end approximately at the same time when it finishes the Mayan calendar in the island Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our hourly area. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> To whom did this idea occur? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, later we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to wanting to assemble enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, also we want to reflect, together with the society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar also we have created the only articles collection: boots, T-shirts, bags and original turnkeys against the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another way of supporting us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap, together with other interpreters, also sang the called anthem against the end of the world, which goes for title &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> At present it is very popular in YouTube: will it be possible to hear in the charitable concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Skylight that yes, and it will be just last, well, whenever everything goes out well and the world is not finished... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> All the interpreters will sing it at the same time in three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems will be connected between themselves simultaneously thanks to the live special transmission in the Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tom√° Han√°k has written the letter of this song and Jesus&apos;s protagonist plays the role in the video, where also he sings Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration arise? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work jointly even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable acts and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our determination in taking part in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been demonstrated that most of them are interested in and it entertains them to work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> To what will be assined the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we take to term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils of the school of Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav receive regularly the teachers&apos; visit with those who realize entertaining and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The pupils have not sufficient economic means to pay away from the teachers and we do an efuerzo to make it possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the frame of the ending of the works in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, there will exist an independent building to which we will move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In every concert several groups and interpreters act. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We try to prepare a program that is attractive for all the generations, including the children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague they will operate Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such √Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> To obtain more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you intend for any other &quot;spectacular action&quot; similar in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May we will operate for the first time in the festival Pra≈æsk√© arum lily, so here of course we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Also we would like to touch the next year me in Bohemian National Entrance hall of New York and, personally, making use that we are in the United States, I would like completing it with performances in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalistas, till now you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, nevertheless, a group formed by persons with disability. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and the organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so difficult how it can seem at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five members in electrical wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the compartment for baggage and also we take a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, till now we have managed them well. THAT ONE and British Airways were prepared perfectly, thing that it does not stop surprising me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, from which we have returned not long ago, it went out quite without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled ones and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have you met till now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses of that, in the East, a lot of way stays for covering. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In contrast to Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it continues and it is not frequent that a person displeases alone for the center of the city in an electrical wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> A little so current as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in wheelchair in elevator, there it it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there has been created a civil association that strengthens for tematizar the problems of the persons with disability. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what aspects must we take example of more anticipated countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many aspects in which we go behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the improving and the progress of the situation always depends on the persons whom it affects straight. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and in Madrid it is very normal that the people with a serious disability move for its account in public and could go to the service, to the museum, where he wants... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common that a big number of persons with disability takes part in the social life of active form, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap: we go a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A respectful society or without barriers it is a thing, but when there comes the moment in which there arise eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, it will begin changing everything really. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Till now, there are isolated cases of persons who have a big willpower. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is at present very popular, but if we look a few years behind: what led you to forming the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered like educator Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, where many young people had around me that they wanted to devote themselves to something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am musical, I touch, between others, the saxophone, founded a group amateur with a coworker. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And with the time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç says, it us went away a little of the hands (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Nevertheless, the popularity did not come until the latter years: or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that we were helped enough by the fact of tuning in to famous singers and also of working actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the helps of the European Union, we can allow ourselves also professorship of quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you have intention of coming that far with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I saw the potential that existed, that it is possible to do something otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The world of the spectacle is full of things that look like some to others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its way, everything new it takes refuge carefully and takes a lot of time in be accepting. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, it is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the compassion is completely superfluous because the persons with disability are not godforsaken beings who suffer and of that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are the people who is capable of living through a full life and of developing, with the condition, of course, of which he has the necessary means. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something goes out well for persons with disability, then, it is not an only one advance for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Did it help the fact that you are a demanding chief, as many people describe him? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do a quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I believe that it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some persons come with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when it find out that have to come two days to test, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this way it is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and obtain something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At present the group The Tap Tap has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already in the beginnings of the year 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The only one: L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, the people enter and go out, it is not possible to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> The one who has will and desire will always find the open doors </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the day before the awaited end of the world, Thursday, the 20.12.2012th at 21 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It will take place in Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fl√©da de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and there will take part 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Three cities will get connected at the end of the party across videoconference to sing jointly the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The target of the concert is to assemble the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav of Prague, which cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and the children up to 12 years have free entry in the put anticipated in Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> In the ministers&apos; meeting of the countries of the celebrated European Spatial Agency last week Poland was accepted like twelfth member of THAT ONE. It is the second member country of THAT ONE of the ancient East Europe block, after the Czech Republic, which turned into full member on November 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland initiated an intense collaboration with THAT ONE in the year 1994 and during the later years it took part in the project commission of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Nevertheless, the way of Poland towards the cosmos started very much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The Polish enthusiasts were already devoting themselves to the flights to the space before the Second World war, although not always its work was understood. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the conference of A. ≈† ternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, on December 6, 1933, it presented its ideas on the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to the cosmon√°utica&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, ≈† ternfeld he remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one that had showed interest in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In the year 1934 ≈† ternfeld Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch obtained in France the award for its &quot;Introduction to the cosmon√°utica&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned previously, turned later into a big promoter of the astronomy and of the cosmon√°utica. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski turned into a promoter of the cosmon√°utica, it was known in the whole world and its contribution to the science turned out to be rewarded when its name put itself to one of the craters of the secret face of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 there was constructed in Poland a dresina that was going to be provided with a rockets engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Regrettably, is not known who the author of the proposal was and neither the destalles of the project are known. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used for the starter of the dresina or for its braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information about this dresina limits itself to the collection in the press of the epoch. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began devoting itself to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The investigation was financed by Kom√≥rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the preserved material, it makes clear to him that the investigation came to the stadium of the practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Nevertheless, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In the year 1937 there appeared in the specializing press the prototype of a missile of photoelectric fighter designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski and the study was published the following year &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot;, of author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were destined for the military use of the engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Committee provisional scientific adviser (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was taking charge of all the projects of skills of missiles for military use and was coordinating all the works. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, he turned out to be interrupted in the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies dedicated to the cosmon√°utica appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the edition of November, 1954 of the magazine Problemy one refers for the first time to the society with four very extensive articles dedicated to the astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, of the prof. M. Subotowicze, there was proposed the creation of a society who would devote herself to the cosmon√°utica. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> In this epoch artificial satellites projects had already been started and it was obvious that the cosmic investigation was a discipline with future perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) was aspiring to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA turned into full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), happened to be the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> It redeemed this charge up to its death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA informed in a significant way in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and turned into the first Polish rocket in which scientific investigation was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was finished in 1957 and he was thrown for the first time on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a 1.800 meters climax, approximately 80 cm long and was not coming to weight of 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, one stopped constructing the version RM-1A and in summer 1959 there began the air tests of the rockets RM-2 of two stages in the B≈Çƒôd√≥w desert. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was measuring 1,4 meters and was weighing approximately 11,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of rocket in development was going to be an object of real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 was going to have a 14,5 km climax and its mission would be to control the height wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Nevertheless, in 1962 the works were suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, which was constructed during the year 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> It was designed like rocket of two stages, with a 510 cm entire length and an initial weight of 32,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> There developed three types (called Meteor-1A,-1B and-1C), which were differing between themselves for the space available for the scientific devices. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the rocket Meteor-1A the space available for the volume was 0,4 liters, in the 0,34 liters Meteor-1B and in the Meteor-1C of 0,62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum climax in three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between the year 1965 and 1968 there developed in the Air Institute the rocket Meteor-2, which first air tests began in October, 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had 380 kg initial weight and it was capable of taking 10 kg useful weight up to 60 km high. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later there was constructed the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the frame of the program Interkosmos, Poland it joined the investigation of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in the year 1978, pilot Polish Miroslaw Hermaszewski turned into the second intercosmonaut after Vladim√≠r Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos social. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution woke up a heated discussion in the society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Certainly it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a wider point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal economic systems in the EU, just as in the encompassed world, are based on the beginning of a major economic and less normative competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and the national economic systems are in permanent conflict between themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause is in the beginning of the free trade and of the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with the wild financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the big differences in the labor cost (of the wages) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Down this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for it &quot;it provokes a bajadda&quot; of the price of the competitor with the target to be done by most of the market and, this way, to increase its benefits margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale it means, for most of the businessmen, to move the production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is an unemployment raised in those countries in which the price of the work, compared to other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with it, he is not also responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expense of the state grows necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this situation propitiates the entire lack of interest of the businessmen for paying taxes and compensating the economic and social damages that they have provoked in its emulation to obtain benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is universally so well-known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The slightly scrupulous practices of the private capital believe situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of the above mentioned countries turn out to be forced to compete with the target to reduce artificially the social level of the proper population and, this way, to attract foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Said otherwise, the governments put capital deprived at the disposal of their own population without bearing in mind the social slope. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This becomes clear especially in the changes of the current laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The target is to force the population to whom he accepts the dictation of the private capital, especially as for the wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on one hand, by means of the system of economic obligation in case of unemployment of long duration; for other one, by means of the restricted right of the personnel as for labor law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is an increasing poverty together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a series of years, food delivery points exist in Germany for poor persons who cannot be supported with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of persons who receive this type of help comes already to the million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the frame of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, a quite frequent case takes place: persons used with a salary so under which the state must pay the rest to come to the essential minimum to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> There became public a scandal of this type related to the situation of the auxiliary personnel of the German federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The measurements of saving of practically all the states of the south of the EU drive, undoubtedly, to the same situation. The persons pressed for an abysmal slope of its social level, turn out to be forced to emigrate as in the XIXth century or to malvivir with awful salary in the limit of the society, with the hope that private investor comes some day to the cardinal country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary preguntrarse where from does it come? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In case it is a question of other countries of the EU, then the poverty happens from one country to other or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African they keep on working on a negligible part of an European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also fond of the whole Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the mass media affirm up to the satiety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which to direct the economy leads to its defeat. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital defends with fingernails and teeth the thesis of that the state should not take control in the economy interfering in the control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Next, it is necessary to wonder if the private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, hence, the whole state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case the answer is clearly affirmative. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The test is the lobbies existence, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all the states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that is evident in the ambience of the corruption, in the mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but it is not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is the following one: the state departments, for lack of financial interests, entrust the law project writing to private juridical companies, which are often linked by the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This type of projects of law is approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> This way, all the power does not come from the people, as he promises to be in the constitutions of the western democracies, but of the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the democracies with a liberal orientation find quickly in a situation how the one that Appi√°nos describes in its work crisis of the Roman republic in times of C√©sar and Pompeii: &quot;The state was taking time disintegrating and the administrations were dealing by force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and it helps to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The bribe and the corruption spread without any impediment and the people were going to the polls with the vote apalabrado in advance&quot;... &quot;there were no people with character who was aspiring to a position in the administration, so once, because of this lack of organization, the state was eight months without consuls&quot;... &quot;One began speaking seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man&quot;... Although Appi√°nos was thinking in Pompeii, C√©sar rose to power and transformed the democracy forever into autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in the same way that in the antiquity, is that the current society bases on inconsiderate preferences of the individual benefit without bearing in mind the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is not capable, in its extract, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same that of then, a decline of the elite without precedents, without an effort being realized to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the heyday of the fascist and communist systems it must be looked, therefore, in the wild liberalization of the economic systems in the XIXth and XXth century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> As regards the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the sake of a democracy of liberal type, like a definite break, in expectation of the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The really devastating fact is that the current elite ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes of which we have been witnesses, as well as the crimes against the humanity, as we know them in the ancient and most recent history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public awarding is not the solution; at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure of the economic competition, so much on a global scale as inside the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will turn out to be forced to keep on looking for other routes to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This tendency is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution happens for concrete sociopolitical reforms, which reinforce both the participation of the capital of the state and the influence of the citizens in the government and which debilitate the position of monopoly of the capital deprived in the society for the sake of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;That nothing you eat from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (nothing arises from the violence and nothing might do it), Sting in its song Fragile and whose refrain prays &quot;Let&apos;s do not forget how fragile we plows&quot; (let&apos;s not forget of fragile that we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my children did not want wars, there would be none&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in its death bed in the year 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After last violence waves between Israel and the stripe of Gaza, have arisen, as always, diverse reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, of the side of Israel, argues in favor of the self-defense right and classifies the Palestinians in the terrorists&apos; roll. Other one supports the Palestinians and racism alleges on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and he corrects Israel of the terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to center who is guilty of the slaughters that recur periodically and who the victim is. After all, the citizens of nowadays of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born inside the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer to the readership a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who extracts profit of the tensions that crawl for 95 years (calculated from the declaration Balfour in November, 1917) in a small surface of ground of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions to which I have come on the base of my own way of understanding the matter, on whom or what group of persons is the main promoter of the events of the modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in the first line. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every epoch we can find a Great Alejandro or a Napole√≥n. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is already not so clear is if they were always these personages those who were directing its steps of an autonomous way or if behind its throne there was someone who was facing its actions towards a certain target. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must accept that we live in an epoch that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it was not possible to have come in only one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Of between these families astron√≥micamente rich there stands out one that might be considered to be the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know it, but I do not discard it): the Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> He does not write himself very much to close to them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Naturally. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 90s of the XIXth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they were stopping associating its name with criminal acts of many gravity. The power and the wealth, or both, were covering the backs, thing that for them always meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have important shares in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, he has declared himself or he is preparing a war for himself: before the attack to Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq there were 5, after demolishing Gadafi, only there were remaining four, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Any that one that has tried to be opposed to this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession printing money and he was murdered in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to print money and he wanted to suspend the system of Federal Reserve (FED) and it was murdered in 1963; conferee Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting to demand the FED for having unleashed the big economic crisis of the year 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Its emulation for the world power led them during the year 1859 - 1871 to planning a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike decorated with the grade 33. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war marked like target to eliminate the big monarchical states in the whole Europe; the second one wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the population of the ground was proposing to reduce the third one between half a million and billion persons (slaves&apos; similar quantity for its well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenicism is not anything more that a draft for similar solution) and the definitive adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method with which it produces the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, it continues the dynamics of the unleashing of crisis and the later offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are, nevertheless, erroneous, and they always bear a worsening of the situation. If not, he is enough to remember that the FED was created so that there was not recuring a crisis as that of the year 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after the success of the murder of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, immediately after it, the First World war was breaking loose, they destroyed the tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World war finished in a sudden and unjustified way from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to finish with the tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the later dismemberment of the big potency of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To pave the way of the Second World war, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a secret way, a difficult situation immediately after the enormous repairs of war imposed on Germany, with what the ideal conditions were created for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, it was enough to them to serve to the Germans the solution of the F√ºhrer, which was the sufficiently strong and simple thing and was indicating culprits, and to construct later a Czechoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that it had to represent and it represented so well the function of the fifth column, which lit the flame and provoked the explosion of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> To the ends of the XIXth century, the Rothschild impelled the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that was aspiring to the formation of the Jewish state, preferably in the region of the ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (I return to the Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The declaration Balfour mentioned previously sat the bases for the massive Jews immigration to Palestine and they began the first local conflicts with the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks were taking place in both parts. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World war exploded: it is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope to which the international bankers had it tied in the beginning or if everything what it did was part of a plan. Nevertheless, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the ideal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded officially in 1948 and, in a way similar to the way in which the repairs of war imposed on Germany leveled the way towards the Second World war, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers were managing to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World war, it would turn into victim in the first combat line, now together with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only in the frame of its country, but also to international scale. Let&apos;s take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel split in an incisive way. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict Palestinian - Israeli? Where does the injustice generate injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if to the beginning of everything there was the greed of some individuals and its emulation for the world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> In this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its chiefs, because, as it happens in our country, the international bankers only present its candidates in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist, loyal politician to the international bankers, which does all the possible to declare the war to Iran and, thinking that Iran is a member of the Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten in turning into a global conflict and, if we bear in mind that Iran controls the strait of Ormuz, where it spends 20 % of the whole world oil (the navigation broker is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what light do there appear now the words that David Rockefeller pronounced in 1994: &quot;The only thing that we need a general crisis is and the people will agree with a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population serves to a persons&apos; fistful that they are part of the quite well-off financial aristocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which a chip is implanted to every new individual after it is born that all its being controls. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it forces all, small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the forehead, to be able neither to buy nor sell, unless they take the name of this monster or the numbers of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand it: who has two fingers straight ahead, that it plunges the numbers of this monster. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty six &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Pel√≠cula Argo: Si se pan de ma√≠z crudo, llame Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November, 1979 a group of the declaration of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Teheran and took 52 qualified ones as hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Its putting at large was going to be in exchange for the overthrown one shah Mohamed R√©za P√°hlevi, who after the revolution fled to USA, country that had sponsored its diet during decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American administration the situation was not offering any positive perspective: to throw the shah for the hut could not allow it to, since, if it was doing it, it was putting in danger the confidence of its Allied Forces in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the putting at large of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had ended in the constitution of the theocratic diet, was not to its scope. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was intensified moreover with the frustrated attempt of liberating the hostages by the force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The imprisoned diplomats were liberated 444 days after the intervention negotiator of the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the USA, its destination caused a wave of solidarity and hostility against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The defeat in Iran Ronald Reagan contributed in a decisive way to the defeat of Jimmy Carter front in the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The movie &quot;Argon&quot; of the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this history, which harvested a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a complicated long journey, they finished in the residence of the Canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to extract them of Iran, for it an extravagant point helped a concealed history: they went out with Canadian passports, like members of the cinematographic team that was examining the location in the country for the shooting of a mammoth production of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Genres combination </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan that the expert in &quot;exfiltration&quot; Toni Mendez planned needed the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So that the lie should seem truthful, he wrote himself on the cinematographic project in specializing magazines, press conferences were organized, the society of fictitious production had a real office enclosed. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details on the operation were supported secretly for the long time, the movie has been done from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The Affleck movie is a singular combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; for other, a called one &quot;caper movie&quot;, the history of an episode that went out well, a trick (an example can be the series Ocean&apos;s Eleven). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the movie the frames of mind get together. We find on the one hand well documented sequences of Teheran. In the credit sequence there appear emblematic photos of the epoch of the events, which were captured in the same way in the movie; there are no a lot of differences in this respect. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> For other, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat more light, marked for the irony and a light exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And also, scenes of the head office of the CIA and other institutions: dressed men who analyze the situation in the table of negotiations, in the corridors of the office, by phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to begin again its career of an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been a mockery object, has turned into the respectable director and its way of acting has stopped being the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argon is its third full-lenght film, after &quot;Farewell kidling, Adi√≥s&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of thieves&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first movie of Affleck in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it grew up. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Also, the sensibility of receiving the local ambience was a characteristic that was placing the directors of ancient movies over standards of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck demonstrates it in Argon, where Teheran &quot;is&quot; &quot;rolled&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the movie take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the capture of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the uncertainty and of the absence of forecast that arises when, in some place, the history passes pass. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and its collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team faker in the bazaar of Teheran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that an explained history does not offer very much in the cinematographic sense of the most fascinating scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And enough good manages them. Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here do not salt everything in a so elegant way (the scene in which it watches the crisis in the airport of Teheran, the deviation of a call to America and the search gone wild after its track turns into a madness). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The Argon weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very graceful role like collaborators of Hollywood, although its personages were deserving more space and there are no, not greatly less, only ones in this movie. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these motives, the Affleck movie loses a little of dramatic line, but it is a movie that can follow with a moderate interest, to value its achievement and the style retro of a thriller that it evokes the 70s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But that it collapses, that will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As evocation of a real history and as test of it exaggerated that can be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the Secret Service, is sufficient. </seg>

<seg id="1376"> Between the nominated absurdities there is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policy between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Till now, the women were getting ahead of better prices in the life insurances because they represent objectively a less risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Other incredible ideas of the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people till the end of this year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at the end of February, 2013&quot;, reported Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Between the controversial regulations of the EU the obligatory biocomponents addition is, for example, to the fuel that, like turned out, it damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of the thermometers of mercury of the whole life only because there contain a small quantity of a dangerous material or the guideline sombre the size of the cages of the hens, which he has contributed to the considerable increase of the price of the eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The prohibition has been criticized f√°ctica of using the expression &quot;butter of smearing&quot; or the retreat of the classic bulb of the commerce. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A quality banana must have a 14 centimeters length. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The device of the Union takes this type of decisions often under the pressure of one or another mercantile or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are defended normally by some state or group of the states (the Czech Republic, even with the veto threat, claims the requirements of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, of which the bananas of major quality had to have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present &quot;abnormal curvatures&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself saying that with this only he thinks about how to harmonize the national norms not homogenized up to the date, which only were complicating its commercialization. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The norms that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, in spite of the opposition of some states, have been smoothed on the base of which the existing board bears an eatables waste. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate for gaining the survey might be the prescription of the EU of last year according to which in the inflatable balloons that are commercialized it is obligatory to warn that the children younger than 8 years are not authorized to inflate them without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when one speaks about toys, the balloons are the main cause of infantile death for asphyxia. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Also there is current a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras on the part of children of up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Curious occurrences are born enclosed in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The same way absurd is the regulation regarding the European officials: any that one that has some official function in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia. Not to hurt the sensibility of Greece, it is necessary to speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The servant Bankovn√≠poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, between some absurd proposals mentioned more above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of the food provisions in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU determined the maximum volumes of food provisions that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic the same day of our entry to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for mushrooms in conserve, what supposed a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey also were interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the subsidies request. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> East class of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are in disadvantage for the fact of having no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We request the European Union a compensation&quot;, there declared in autumn of 2004 the minister of that time of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (√àSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued it with the fact that in our country cereal was taking place very much and, as a result of the called intervention buys, the state had the full stores and it had been to export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Spades, since the Czech Republic is far from the marine ports, the EU should pay to us hundreds of million euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission proved to be ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public contest for the buy of the cereal of the countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to the municipalities by the department for the local development directed by the minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is destined for the writing of requests of subsidies of Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: The rare prescriptions are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the member states are often white of criticism, the efforts of the EU on the subject of regulations and, also, a more effective functioning and development in the whole Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the cashing of subsidies of the EU for projects that have not anything in common with the deepening of the European integration, but that the member states have obtained in the negotiations on budgets. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> To the Czechs also the sensitive fibre touches them, in the same way that to other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the denomination of origin of its traditional products, although our country not always has gone out victoriously of these battles. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian, defended successfully the denomination of origin of the cottage cheese of Olomouc, but they had to change the name to him to the national rum, which tradition in our country goes back a XIXth century, and it happened to call &quot;tuzem√°k&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products prepared from distilled of sugar-cane can be named a rum, but not those facts from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of denominations of origin protected from the EU, together with the cheeses feta and gorgonzola known in the whole world, the marzipan of the German city Lubeck or the ham of Parma, already there are for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho≈ôelice and of T≈ôebo ≈à and, enclosed, the variety of hop of ≈Ωatec. </seg>

<seg id="1418"> And since I already am forty years old and my candidacy it is independent, the only possibility that I have of changing the things is to present me like senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> It has already come to the Senate, but soon it has set out towards the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is not it giving the back to those persons who have voted for it? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that my candidacy to the presidency was depending on the results in the elections of the senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I added that if elected senator was going out, it would present my candidacy to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my target is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas real. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That&apos;s why I need the biggest possible influence and the order as strong as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not alone that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we trample to anyone that wants to initiate a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This there him join the mass media, which discredit you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> Of me it is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser of Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to speak about its ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It appears to the presidential struggle with financial theses and penal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property over twenty millions. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> For it it must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president does not have this competition and only the senate in its set can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How does he want to solve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Like citizen, I have been part of a lobby so that the guide office was recognized like autonomous work, and we obtain it. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is in the politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, already be of rights or of lefts, it is pushed back by the way and this affects the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Like independent candidate, I have a major potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without pigeonholing or dogmas of party, I have the aptitude to be able to choose something between every party that is better for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Is he considered to be rather a man of rights or of lefts? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people consider me to be more of lefts. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it has no importance, be already a little of lefts or a little of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What it imports for me is that we go out forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It does not import for me if anybody is of rights or of lefts, I want to join the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support openly any good solution, independently if the proposal comes from the KSƒåM or from the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against of the bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It does prank when it is said of you that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But is not it demonstrating it with what he says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When one creates a managerial plan for the company, you have also certain targets and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try to approach them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who call it a populism, but all the proposals about which I speak already work in the world or expert acquaintances speak about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament only he has left slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with it it cannot survive in the long-term politics. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that if you speak to the persons and he speaks with them, you will obtain, for example, a penal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I do not have another option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To convince politicians, journalists and the civil society and to try to put them on my part to obtain it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If he was elected a president, there would no be problem in organizing a live transmission for television in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize the penal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and district attorneys of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, possibly, they would have to communicate that porqu√© they do not wish it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personage who indicates the disputes, it is possible to do pressure in the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Let&apos;s take as a case the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I affirm that I am only a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my opinions and ideals I try to look for Allied Forces. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just started in the politics and try to obtain the biggest possible support for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try to extract the things myself forward, but in case I do not go out well, in six years I will leave it and will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a little as if Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not any savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that with a person I do not do anything, that&apos;s why I have visited to a series of well-known personalities, if perhaps they were cheering up to present its candidacy to the senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because it had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part at least I have supported the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencov√°, which extracted to the light the frauds with light heating oils. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I presented before myself departing from the base of which the people are really unsatisfied, now I am in the scales. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and, those that did it, they voted for the representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the senate we are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the senate, in such a way that it will be complicated to achieve changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will defend my own ideas, like for example the direct election of mayors or of governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Is he considering to form your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I still neither have considered it because I have no time for it, to verify the irreproachable past of each of the potential members of the party, I nor have money either. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money not for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account only there are 20.000 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Has it no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> He speaks about declarations of the property: how is his? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I estimate my private ownership in approximately 60 millions. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague I have an area valued for 25 millions, a valued apartment ten millions, another apartment appraised in eight millions, a collection of works of art with a value of ten millions, an Aston Martin of approximately 3,5 million and one ≈† koda Superb valued for a million, and in the account I have a pair of millions. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Certainly, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth sleep. I always liked James Bond, that he was leading this car, it was gallant with the women and, at the same time, it was fighting against the nastiness and injustices. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Does he lead an Aston Martin, its property is valued for 60 millions and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that he wants to change the republic but he does not want to put too much money of its part. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 millions for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I have to get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I have already put 2,5 millions. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that it does not have any sponsor it demonstrates that there is no too much interest in my program. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The expenses of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive by way of senator&apos;s salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But he might not live of it. For example, he might not pay to my son the English school, which costs 30.000 monthly crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If he wanted to gain only money, then he would not present himself as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So it will continue with its managerial activity to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Has not he said before it was going to leave this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has not anything in common with a major salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> Since I have promised, partly I have left my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will happen to be my substitute in spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people would like that he was the Samaritan who was saving the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live of something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much does he accustom to win monthly like businessman? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200.000 and 400.000, which I keep on gaining. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If he was a president, then it would leave the business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> It can consult the whole interview in the Pr√°va Saturday edition. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The study of architecture MVRDV demonstrates that the real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and newly completed &quot;books mountain&quot; - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I believe that the building is entertained, has a futurist aspect, and finally there is something interesting that to see&quot;, affirms Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by who happens for the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And YOUR Stefan Spermon, technician in a big company placed close to the library, aims: &quot;also, the building is nice&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we need a library nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Nobody enters taste these past fashionable libraries: no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory suburb placed on the verge of R√≥terdam that scarcely a fleeting visit deserves, shows the doubtful honor of having risen with a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80.000 inhabitants presents the lowest valuation of literacy of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To resist this so shameful situation, some years ago it decided to be contributed somehow to the general culture and copy seven fictitious bridges that turn out to be represented in the tickets of euro in the shape of decorated miniatures of armed concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And this way he was like the political persons in charge they decided that only a possibility existed to improve the statistics: it was necessary to construct a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of the study of architecture Dutch MVRDV, the whole teacher in the art of the diagrams of bars and responsible for entertaining just as cynical buildings, took the topic with its habitual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury was looking perplexed around him and was shrinking of shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile up the books for size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: &quot;Dear fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so called one `Boekenberg&apos;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros gets up in the due place. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> This one is part of the project of revitalization, which is completed by an underground parking, a supermarket, an office of post office and a pair of apartment houses and semi-detached houses. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November the books mountain was rewarded by the second award &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Also, the project also is nominated to &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus the small city lacking in history, which up to the date did not have anything more that to offer that a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white front one would know by intuition rather a dairy head office, is provided now with a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But especially, Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long way up to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that it is a question of a books paradise under a cheesemaker. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Well it is true that there is an elevator that transports us just to the center of this mountain range, but the real lovers of the space and the reading do not use it, but they prefer to melt with its topography to every step of its climb to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The completely glazed interior turns out to be luminous and easy to include with the sight, the soil of recooked brick and the elegant lampposts support of unequivocal form the public condition of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban ambience is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> On having lifted the sight, they can go so far as to visualize the banks of the park, the dogs and the children and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And for all sides books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the books shelves are ready along the front and in the center there is opened an enormous dark room that, in general, is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal&quot;, affirms Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done is to put upside down the classic spatial configuration and to extract the area of reading of the interior on the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is very quite well used: in the way there are the offices, the library of Internet, the club of chess, the center of environmental education and the room of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Special mention is deserved by the black shelves that assume the functions of wall revetment, parapet and rail at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, the tact and the smell are strange. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and the civil engineers more a day shake the head when they hear to speak about this unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with materials recycled&quot;, tells to us Joop Trouborst, chief of the project in the city of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And this way it is like one day, in a farm frisia, we come across with the suitable by-product proceeding from the agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in the hothouses and in the fields of the Netherlands there is used a plastic textile of scarce millimeters of thickness like base to hold the roots of the cultivation. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a question of a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This thin textile lasts two stations and later it is rejected. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library this textile was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, up to obtaining irons of four centimeters of thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and the pressure, the so called plastic agricultural (KLP) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells to a miscellany of new car and sneaker of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps it goes over to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this almost 500 meters continuous route about the mountain waits to us for the reward: from the snack bar not only a fantastic sight of the city is had, but in her also it is possible to enjoy a few tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus reached on enormous flowerpots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create an agreeable ambience while they maintain the atmospheric humidity adapted for this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;Although it is difficult to believe given its big glazed surfaces, this building is a model project as for the ecology&quot;, points out Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The necessary heating and the refrigeration are obtained from geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the books mountain is placed under an enormous crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the alone sun shines for a few hours in its interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The enormous cerchas of wood placed in transverse sense to the crystal front serve to give shade and absorb most of the beams of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This believe a comfortable interior climate. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is a thing of the automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the hard-working skeptic of the sector of the Information technologies, already has dared to put the foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig also has been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> The same way, the teacher of Chinese traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; like &quot;late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, owing to the opening that took place it does a pair of weeks, one invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> With this form one tries to fill, at the moment, the optical hollows of a library that is still not provided with its finished file; at present it has 70.000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> El concepto ah calado hondo. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are replete. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse that a library way empties&quot;, affirms the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain tie with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> They all know that its book is part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although it is only there to adorn. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus the study MVRDV there has obtained the whole success in this discipline queen who in the specializing slang is known as &quot;a creation of an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Independently of young man and ignoramus that could be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally a starting point to shape its identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must redeem one more role protagonist&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in the voting on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert in the relations USA. UU.-Europa, this places Berlin in a quite tricky diplomatic position. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of week, Germany gave to understand that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories the condition of the observant State of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Nevertheless, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now then, due to the special relation that it joins to the country with Israel, Germany must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that it does not endorse the North American position either. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the raising that took place in Libya in March, 2011, Germany also abstained when of what one was trying age to establish an area of prohibition of flight. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This one has been declared finally by the NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Does it turn out to be difficult to Germany to adopt a clear position when important international topics are in game? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, this way it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that in these moments it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a led politics, for this way saying it, for the United States and centring on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what makes difficult moreover the things is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform politics. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are in an intersection. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Of them one hopes that they should redeem a more independent roll, but they are not used to doing it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still feeling the way what its role will be, but they have already initiated the way towards a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to the countries as France or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean specifically from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a politics that, when it is a question of national interests, proves to be ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European associates. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is to say, in the exports and in its relations with certain regions, as there can be Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other big potency and for that reason Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Have these economic interests influenced the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the voting of the UNO? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany is provided with big markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this motive it must be careful and not alienarse neither of the nor Arab public opinion either of the Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give him so much importance position that it is not a question of a completely unilateral relation. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Nevertheless, yes they redeem a fundamental role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Has its relation undermined Germany with the USA. on having abstained from voting in important decisions as in the voting on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous comprehension grade. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this motive, I do not believe that a rupture so drastic has taken place as in case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with it Germany has managed to obtain a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, all this has not made but to demonstrate that it is a country to which they take seriously like international actor and whose interests it is necessary to bear in mind. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe different opinions exist about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On the other hand, the USA. has appeared clearly in favor of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Does opinions disparity exist between the USA. and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These disparities have always existed due to the American interior politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that Obama&apos;s government shows secretly one big comprehension towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation that it is lived here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real opinions disparity does not have in fact the importance that assumes to him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If we analyze the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything got enthusiastic with the politics that it develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does it turn out to be difficult to council Germany the narrow relations that it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main associates in the EU, for other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that it is precisely that what does that it is so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Surely it would be a little easier for the Germans if a coherent and homogeneous European politics existed, but it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a top entity, but they must impel the things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future Germany it will assume a leadership role at the time of forcing Europe to adopt an European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Surely this is not easy at all for Germany, already be simply for the relation that it maintains with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a tricky topic. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans are sure that they must redeem the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany does one see herself in the role of important international actor? Does he want in fact Germany to assume a role protagonist? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps does it keep on turning out to be difficult to accept this leadership to him? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany still has not got accustomed, it always turns out to be slightly uncomfortable and, for clear motives, to the country it follows him finding it hard to redeem a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we observe the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany posiciona like main actor, certain antiGerman feelings come untied. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This does not turn out to be easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It is a question of an old problem and the fact is that nobody would like to be surrounded with the hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> I dress thus, Germany is in a position much more difficult than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must show a receptive attitude opposite to the different neighbors and opinions and that does not turn out to be easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the USA. in the European politics diminishes increasingly, but the EU does not cover at the moment this gap: who stays then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will not have left any more remedy to assume one more role protagonist. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like, if it turns out to be unpleasant to them or if it turns them in an even more unpopular people, c&apos;est the vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is an Executive director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academic and expert in politics proceeding from Europe and from North America they analyze in common the challenges which the transatlantic community faces. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of German Marshall Fund, where it has specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of marks&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani turn suddenly into Chinese marks </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a well-known mark on a global scale and Pole Ralph Lauren also. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But: what is Armani Pole? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After this name one hides a denomination registered officially in China but that has not anything in common with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, this one enjoys protection while the real eponymous ones do not present a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear that it goes to give them the account. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It turns out to be more and more difficult to protect its marks in China to the foreigners&quot;, points out Thomas Pattloch pleaded of the buffet Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of protection rights in Far East. </seg>

<seg id="1640"> Thus Gucci turns into Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny registers. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The German companies also are copied legally of the same way, as Puma has happened to the manufacturer of sports articles. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats of the office of marks of Peking. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010 a Chinese company requested to register the mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also Ermenegildo Zegna was making use of the fashionable house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are world champions in that thing about copying and of violating the intellectual property rights he is in abundance an acquaintance. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities there exist department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsifications. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Nevertheless, the cases of Pattloch are of another nature. For order of its clients, he fights against the fact that the marks office grants of official form to the Chinese companies the right to extract profit of a denomination that is already registered in another place. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese name it &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or accompanist marks. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;, </seg>
<seg id="1649"> that refers to women who have &quot;caught&quot; a rich man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is harmful to the business, it is necessary to fight against it&quot;, demands Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The mark does waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the loss that incurs the image it is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the procedural coasts of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in case of luxurious emblematic products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to information of the company of market analysis CLSA, with a volume for 15.000 million euros a year China is, in size, the third market of luxury articles and the one that grows to major rhythm. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Nevertheless, to achieve the annulment of inscriptions of doubtful legality in the marks record turns out to be complicated and also he supposes a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The processes can extend up to nine years and the result is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks about cases in which the court rejected a demand because it had passed so much time that the name object of the demand had already turned into a &quot;reality of market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;If the claimant has no luck, perhaps even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged to the mark of this one in China&quot;, points out Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the forest. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a suit against the manufacturer of machinery of construction Sany, the company that has been absorbed not long ago by the German manufacturer of bombs of concrete Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That&apos;s why to today the Chinese can keep on using an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, was using at first a logotype in white and blue that remembered to a great extent BMW; the matter was dissolved in the courts and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of clothes Lacoste lost in China against imitators proceeding from Hong Kong and Singapore which logotype was representing a crocodile looking in the direction opposite to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The office of marks CTMO in Peking admits that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the scarcity of equipment and endowment of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, nevertheless, &quot;the situation of labor emergency returned to the normality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus the claim process quantity without proceeding has diminished in 22 %. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57.000 of these cases resolved themselves solved, 75 % more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still dependent on resolution. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To fight against this costs a lot of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Since it is usually habitual in China, the numbers are surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO registered more than 1,4 million protection requests of marks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It would be a question of a new record and it means that China leads in tenth consecutive year the list of new inscriptions in the whole world, as points out the marks office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this also happens with the number of logos valid, number that amounts to 5,5 millions in whole. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 1.800 million yuanes would have been pocketed by way of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Said about another form, this means that of average every inscription costs 1.280 yuanes or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To fight against this costs a lot of money, as it demonstrates the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the group fights in the courts against a Chinese imitator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Although the Germans have managed to detain the illegal manufacture of pieces of motorcar of imitation, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> the imitator has managed to insure himself the Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;We have provoked this situation ourselves because in Germany the surnames are not protected&quot;, points out Hanno Wentzler, President and Manager of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The office of marks CTMO also rejected the resource of the of Munich ones. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In two following instances they have given the account to Freudenberg, but the opposite part keeps on fighting at present. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It is necessary to be very careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has come on the verge of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still dependent on resolution. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident of being able to solve favorably the question and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, also he affirms that &quot;the procedure is extremely costly, so much in terms of money as of time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It turns out to be difficult to estimate the internal costs; the managerial file has had to check records of up to hundred years of antiquity to be able to contribute tests. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the opposite part a &quot;sum of six numbers in euros&quot; with the target to come to a friendly agreement, but it was not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This demonstrates the great thing that matters for us&quot;, points out Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that they watch in Far East threaten even to affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> specifically if the imitators insure themselves there the rights on not protected marks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This way, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Some time ago that the group left this commercial ambience, nevertheless the inscription managed to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is necessary to be very careful&quot;, affirms Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> So much he like lawyer Pattloch recommend to the German companies to be extremely prudent at the time of carrying on business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to trust in the international legislation on mark rights, but what it is necessary to do is &quot;to register also in China all that that could be capable of protection&quot;, as points Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the topic can turn out to be much more expensive than a simple record. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, in case Freudenberg was losing the last assault of its particular battle, then he would have to pay to the opposite part license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question they would expel us from the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of the struggle against the AIDS: to dance, to sing, to help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg it tests the choir Imbongi and in Suazilandia the orphans of the AIDS are glad </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The history of a tie capable of which to overcome much more than 8.733 kilometers of distance. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First one starts by the dance: boots of cowboy, sneakers of basketball, shoes of heel and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet soil, and find it quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then there begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, down, tenor and soprano), swirling, being obstructed and following some others. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Entrust to you Hopf, the 29-year-old director, it threatens to leave almost of its pigeonholes after energetic and soft gestures try to clear up with its. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is a Monday evening and in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tests a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Also fifty singers have come, of between 23 and 69 years, from the human geneticist up to the homeowner. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language scarcely well-known: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million persons in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Suazilandia. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> It helps for the self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an ONUSIDA estimation, the program of the United Nations for the struggle against the AIDS, in the whole world there exist approximately 34 million persons infected by the virus of the VIH. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23,5 millions of them live in the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Suazilandia there are 245.000 orphans of the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40 % of the population is already seropositive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents for 180 orphans of the AIDS of the people of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them are present at the secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month it is possible to support a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the registration of the school, the uniform and will guarantee a warm meal a day in Gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;narrator of histories&quot; or &quot;panegirista&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room nobody can speak fluently this Bantu language, but sing yes they know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For ten years this choir tests songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to its origin place: the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> To 8.733 kilometers of distance in straight line from Heidelberg, in the North-East of the kingdom of Suazilandia, there exists a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty per cent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Approximately 2.000 persons live there, someone still in simple huts of mud and straw, a big part of them is children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 already have no parents because they have succumbed to the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Suazilandia: the infection valuation of been the highest and the lowest life expectancies of the whole world, according to Unicef. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that as it has been demonstrated the contagion risk limits to the half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 % of the inhabitants of Suazilandia is bearers of the virus of the immunodeficiency, and to die with something more about thirty years has turned into something habitual. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring 2005 this recondite population discovered the choir, but what they saw especially they were many children in the streets who were lacking not only the protection of its parents, but the main thing: meal, clothes and formation. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of few ones what it was making possible that a child was going to the school and enjoyed a warm meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Nevertheless, one year later the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; that since then has dealt professionally with the orphans of the AIDS in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts on the infections of sexual transmission </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Between the ETS of bacterial origin there are the syphilis, the clamidia and the gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The most habitual ETS of viral origin is the AIDS, the human virus of the papilloma, the genital herpes or the hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The crab louses and the mange are between the ETS transmitted by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups of affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and the gonorrhea happen with more frequency in men who maintain sexual intercourse with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert Koch departs from the base of which at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In case of the heterosexual adults the most habitual sexually transmitted diseases are the infections for clamidia, tricomonas, the human virus of the papilloma, the candidiasis (mushroom) and the gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The contagion of the VIH between the heterosexual adults of the country is relatively scarce; nevertheless, approximately 20 % of the new infections for VIH registers in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Between the young people, the infections for clamidia are much more habitual than in other groups of population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all the infections affect young people of between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human virus of the papilloma also is added to the most habitual illnesses between the youth. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections evolved? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to obligatory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections for syphilis has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new infections for VIH maintains a downtrend from 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011 approximately 2.700 cases registered. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is a question of a tenth part less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms do they indicate that it is a question of a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious illnesses can provoke ulcers in the genital area, inconveniences on having urinated, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often they neither cause pain nor provoke other symptoms and that&apos;s why they are not detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How is it possible to protect one? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> The condoms can reduce the contagion risk, but they do not offer protection by one hundred per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogenic sexually transmitted diseases agents also can be transmitted across infections by dirt and by physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this motive, the experts recommend to surrender regularly to medical examinations, especially if it changes often of sexual couple. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If they are diagnosed of early form, most of the ETS can be treated and it is possible to avoid any late consequence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Across collaborations, donations and, finally but not for less important it, of the fees that the choir receives for its performances in the whole Germany, they go so far as to collect enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In whole we have already sent approximately 200.000 euros to Esitjeni&quot;, points out proud Annette Lennartz, the president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the proper people Zodwa Dlamini a sure woman of himself and with leadership talent he administers the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It deals that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The &quot;gogos&quot;, since the biggest women are named in Zulu, are the props of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> They have some of them up to 14 orphans to its charge, offer them a roof where to live and they deal that the children come to the school every day punctually and dressed in its uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those that they do not have to anybody stay under the Khanyisile protection, a single woman who, as two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, perceives a salary of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Also, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has started a seam school, has constructed two henhouses and, in collaboration with the American sanitary organization PSI, it has achieved that many of the inhabitants of the people have been put to a VIH test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not anything obvious, since, in spite of the clear thing that this illness is in the whole country, it usually not speak openly about her. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;The AIDS is an absolute taboo&quot;, affirms Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with the sexuality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> There surprised something in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, king Mswati III, is met by its life style opulent and replete with excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This form of not recognized life officially is largely responsible for the spread so rapid that the virus of the VIH has experimented on last decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also it owes to itself the innumerable seasonal ones that cover the country up and down and that take it there where they go. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;in any corner condoms can be obtained free, but these scarcely are used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> It is another culture, here only they accept the contact skin against skin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To encourage the cultural exchange, the choir Imbongi travels every two or three years in the South of Africa singing songs that they speak about melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many people in the most southern end of the African continent still remember of the epoch of the apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white persons who sing songs in a blacks language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent ambience and many happiness, but also it has managed to start a pair of tears to some rabid frontier soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the supported children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although this small population scarcely appears in the maps, in the vale of the river Ezulweni it is very well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Approach Esitjeni, there the light shines&quot;, affirm the local people. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after covering 8.733 kilometers in straight line back to Heidelberg up to the rooms of essay of the street Bergheimer replete with singers marking the step, one realizes that also it is possible to see shining its light from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: The NASA discovers ice in Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger has found tests of the existence of ice in Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The NASA, the North American spatial agency, has contributed tests of the existence of ice in Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> In spite of talking each other of the planet nearest to the sun, there also there is frozen water, as it gets rid of three studies published Thursday in the specializing magazine &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger would have found proofs that in the area of the planet that is permanently to the shade an ice layer has formed. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water comes possibly from comets or, with big probability, from asteroids that in due time hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Nobody relates the ice find to the possibility that life exists in the planet, affirms the investigative chief of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Nevertheless, the finds might help to clarify how there have come the water and other components of the life to other areas of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Of completely inadvertent form for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix devote themselves to explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Occasionally they send images to the Earth: small windows to the immensity of the space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camerawoman developed by German investigators of the Institute Max Planck. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Eight planets that shape our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> As Pluto, which turns about the just sun behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not any &quot;planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an image of infrared taken the telescope Spitzer shows a &quot;portrait of family&quot; in which infinite generations of stars appear: the most ancient stars appear like blue points, although the most difficult thing to recognize there is the pink color of the &quot;new-born&quot; stars. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of formation of stars, named of slightly romantic form for the scientists W5, was discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the Casiopea constellation, at a distance of 6.500 light years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This iridescent image of a star in extinction was taken the telescope Spitzer of the NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The ring in the shape of donut is composed by the material that the star spits in its extinction process. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the enormous Nebula Tr√≠fida, at 5.400 light years of the Earth, new stars form from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The telescope Spitzer of the NASA took this picture of the area of galactic stellar formation. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pl√©yades, a group of stars also known with the by-name of &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, are a visible object to simple sight in the night sky. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Nevertheless, with the telescope the colors can be appreciated better. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The Nebula of the Helix appears like an enormous red eye appears in this image of infrared. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> She is placed at 700 light years of the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has cost him the by-name of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of a normal photo and an image of infrared gives place to a spectacular coloring. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This star in blossomings could be received in all its splendor for the first time by the detectors of infrared of the telescope Spitzer. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: how did they originate one of the big unknowns keeps on being of the astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Probably it is a question of remains of one of the moons of Saturn that disappeared and 4.500 million years ago did not leave track. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the biggest and clearest photos taken the telescope Hubble: the Galaxy of the Maelstrom. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the tonalities, some images of galaxies spirals turn into real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Nebula Tr√≠fida placed to several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Tr√≠fida comes from the Latin term &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided in three), since a few dark dust lines divide the white hot heart of this area of stellar formation in three lobes. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic cannon: to 400 million light years of the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in merger process rush one towards other to end up by hitting of irremediable form. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This stars formation was received by the telescope Hubble in the galaxy spiral M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to her with the by-name of Southern Mill. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the spatial telescope Hubble shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the Cefeo constellation. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula placed at 1.400 light years is composed by particles of dust which size is between ten and hundred times smaller than that of the particles of dust that we can find in a house. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created from optical images and radiographies done by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes placed to 430 million light years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a moment as model for the spatial telescope Hubble of the NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists name the galaxy spiral of major size UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula there is the group of more brilliant young stars of our Milk Route. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This area of stellar formation produces constantly new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, associated with the Cloudy Rosette, also they arise continuously new star; at 5.000 light years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this so brilliant galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, alone gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The investigators suppose that he formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it was possible to find especially hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei was using one year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes it has not stopped growing and the images that offer us have more and more depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Pulls placed in the Observatory Dovecote close to San Diego it was the biggest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Its mirror, in the image, had a five meters diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the USA., Large Binocular Telescope gets up. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This one allows to observe the cosmos across two mirrors, each one with a 8,4 meters diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Big Telescope Canaries placed in the Island of Palma is enormous - alone the mirror has a 10,4 meters diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite it, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, for what its mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its peculiarity is its enormous aptitude to gather light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> In spite of being provided with a mirror diameter comparatively smaller, the above mentioned capacity is comparable to that of the bigger telescopes of mirror of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With help of the radio-telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the investigators can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio-telescope has a 305 meters diameter. </seg>

<seg id="1853"> Here there gets up Very Large Telescope, a telescope that does honor to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a whole of four mirrors, this telescope also can illuminate the average infrared bogey. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> THAT also will receive the so called E-ELT (Europaean Extremely Large Telescope or extremely Big European Telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror will include 42 meters and it will be composed by a whole of 1.000 reflecting elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018 one does not hope to be able to take images. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007 two telescopes Keck placed in the volcano from Hawaii of Mauna Kea were considered to be the biggest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> These are provided with two mirrors, each of them with a 10 meters diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The telescopes Keck are part of the Observatory Mauna Kea, which along with them explores the sky with the help of the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> In Mauna Kea it is foreseen to construct a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of thirty meters mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is an image of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> Nevertheless, the most important information of the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the spatial telescope Hubble. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> From April 24, 1990 he sends images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> From March, 2009 the spatial telescope Kepler looks for extrasolar, principally those planets that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On February 2, 2011 the NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission 1.235 candidates for planets had been located. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the image there are seen the last arrangements before to the throwing of the spatial telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not throw himself to the space on board of a rocket Ariane 5 until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of this spatial telescope has a 6,5 meters diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The investigators depart from the base of which in the south Mercury pole also there is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Nevertheless, reliable tests do not exist, since the probe Messenger turns concerning the planet in an orbit much nearer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades the radar measurements point at the ice existence in Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first one that orbits concerning Mercury, now the scientists have the certainty of which it is like that. </seg>

<seg id="1881"> A traces search in a country in which the 97-year-old persons are still considered to be young people. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip by the mountainous Talysh region might be considered to be wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minib√∫s advances with big tumult across the sinuous highway that happens next to wooded hills, rivers of big wealth and of the simple houses of the local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, even one might think that it is in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Nevertheless, we are in the most southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is to only a few kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here they live through the &quot;talyshi&quot;, a village that it is not known very much, apart from the fact that they dominate perfectly the Persian and the azer√≠ and that they are very long-lived. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small city presumes of an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet age and that does not seem to fit completely in such a picturesque mountainous scenery. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The European tourists scarcely come to this place, since the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, turns out to be too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> To cover 323 kilometers that separate both downtowns, they are needed eight hours because the highway is of only one sense. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The amazing wealth which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea still has not come to this recondite region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Nevertheless, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is sure that Lerik has what it is necessary to have to turn into a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May owing to the celebration of the Festival of Eurovision and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the most aged persons of the world&quot;, points out Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is a question of the director of the Museum of the Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here there is documented the life of eight dozens of local talyshis that have overcome 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a black and white image. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> A son of his died at the age of 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Nevertheless, the indisputable star of the museum is the sheep shepherd ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, who seems to have lived 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Nevertheless, there does not exist any birth certificate that certifies it. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And if we bear in mind that the man of major documented age lived 122 years, it seems that the M√ºsl√ºmov age is quite suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973&quot;, tells to us Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married in three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently one more daughter still had time to conceive at the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has M√ºsl√ºmov been wrong then ≈ûirali in its age in a pair of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Nevertheless, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in the Institute Max Planck de Rostock, also has heard to speak about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;In some regions of China, Japan or in the vale of Hunza in Pakistan also persons of very advanced age live&quot;, affirms Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many major men&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the absence of papers, it turns out to be impossible to contribute scientific tests about the age; especially when no registry office exists either. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day glasses full of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, of form surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region placed concerning Lerik usually reach a Biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> At present there are 20 persons who overcome 100 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why do so many persons of advanced age live here, in the south? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The tourist guide azer√≠ Farid Mugimzadeh tells that it is a question of the special genes of the talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes on the other hand that the cause resides in the feeding. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Nevertheless, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the feeding rich in calories of the talyshi, which adore the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and many of which, also, drink every day a glass of melted butter, be so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or perhaps be the form of natural life the one that maintains the young people? In Cengemiran, not far from the city of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives through a small establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> At its 97 years it is relatively young for what estila for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who affirms to have 143 progeny, lives in a simple house of typical wood of the whole region of the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting in the soil, moves of tireless form an enormous butter tub. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight persons live under a roof, between them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both turned into grandparents some time ago. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also two small children skip up and down. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in a few typical glasses with convex form. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and they are aligned perfectly and down the handkerchief he hides two long braids of dark fair-haired hair that its son discovers us proudly. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, that&apos;s why it me has never fallen down and has maintained its color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;Either I have never used a shampoo&quot;, affirms Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is sufficient to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Everlasting he has eaten only what it was producing in its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In all my life I have never gone to do the buy to a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then he speaks to us about its husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst thing there was the epoch later to the Second World war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Nevertheless, everything returned to its river bed when the &quot;dear father&quot;, Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This type of propaganda sounds rarely in mouth of a major woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Nevertheless, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, which directs its country like a dictator, does not know limits. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> This one was supported in the power until 2003, moment in which the witness transferred its son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know what is the poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (approximately the same quantity in euros) by way of monthly pension, a quantity with which it is possible to live well bearing in mind the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the hoary Mirzayeva son is right: &quot;in our culture the biggest are much respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if this was not a reason sufficient to stay alive many years... </seg>
<seg id="1938"> In the Constitution the expression &quot;Human rights&quot; is missing </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to the Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Declarations that compete between themselves in the Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is plunged. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, with the sharia like base, turns out to be very controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president did not spare effort in pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> &quot;We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that that happens it is my responsibility, before the people and before God&quot;, he affirmed in the public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Its speech was directed to the whole village, especially to the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them plunged without remedy till now in a confused opposition, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Moslem community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, it has had that ring finger of temporary form the competitions of the Constitutional court and to extend theirs &quot;to be able to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> Nevertheless, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a title of doctorate granted by the University of the South of California wants to save really. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Does he try to obtain from its power to the judicature? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles, which approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed by 100 predominantly Islamist members in a night meeting of 15 hours of duration, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, in the draft also it is said that the jurisprudence is based on the &quot;beginning of the Islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Nevertheless: what means that thing about &quot;beginning&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and he keeps on being opened to the interpretation and it seems that the Islamist ones are going to make use of this vague formulation, as well as of the juridical margin of maneuver that it has prepared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least what suggests a new added article: in all the questions relative to the sharia it is obligatory to consult the University Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a big power in the whole Islam sun√≠. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It does not have why to be like that, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - it would take as proved the impeachment of the judicature. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Big part of the draft of the constitution is opened for the interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> What also turns out to be problematic is that he tries to maintain the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After it was falling down of the dictator even 11.000 civil ones were stopped in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As it establishes the draft, the State has to protect &quot;the real extract of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to promote its mulberry tree and its values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is a question of such a vague formulation in juridical terms that with the help of this article the state institutions even might control the contents of the cinematography and the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Speaking skylight it is not a question of another thing than of censoring. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Certainly that no article establishes of explicit form the equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> On the other hand other prohibits to offend or be slandered the Prophet Mohammed and its legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Nevertheless, does not remain clear what an affront is and how it has to be sanctioned. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equal doubtful is the formulation that prohibits the &quot;affront the persons&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is sufficient a caricature of the president or a pleasantry on an attorney? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for its signature and that according to, its words, &quot;very quickly&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> It has been weeks since the opposition is closing lines opposite to the superiority of the Islamist ones. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand persons met in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in the square Tahrir del Cario and swore to make fail the Record before it could come into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will end up by winning&quot;, affirms Hamdin Sabbahi, which occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Prize of the Peace and the exdirector of the International organization of Atomic energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, he declared that the draft of the constitution should be &quot;in the garbage can of the history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Across Twitter he accused the Mursi followers of wanting to lead a &quot;coup d&apos;√©tat against the democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;When it summons the referendum we will go to its palace and will demolish it&quot;, affirms the opponent Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers still has not been expiated&quot;, the opposing politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian means. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that they did not want to supervise the referendum, by what it would not be considered to be valid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For his part, the quite organized Moslem community called to celebrate a counter-demonstration; just in case not in the square Tahrir, but after a prayer to another side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many women covered with a veil and partial to the salafistas they took part in the same one to the scream of: &quot;the people demands the divine law enforcement&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They were demanding from Mursi &quot;to clean the country&quot;, at the same time that they were proclaiming: &quot;the Koran is our constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic square Tahrir, where everything began, had provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is clear that the followers of Mursi did not want to risk to which something like that was happening. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Moslem brothers affirmed that so much those who are opposed to the draft of the constitution as the followers of the same one they would have expressed its opinions highly and clearly. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now there would have come the moment to leave that the people was deciding in the urns what direction the country should continue. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamist ones has the majority guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The expression &apos;Human rights&apos; does not even appear&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that in fact should have lasted until February and to have included to all the social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human rights (EOHR) defended the Moslem brothers when they were retained in prison or they had to face to a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because he was sharing its ideology, but because for him the Human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this motive it was struck, condemned and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the expression `Derechos Human beings&apos; does not even appear in the new constitution&quot;, complains in a conversation with periodic &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The enlargement of the competences of Mursi in three powers of the State did that this lawyer was resigning himself. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The adopted measurements are flagrant violations of the laws of the game democratically and they will lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening the civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it&quot;, Saeda complains. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Nevertheless, the democracy cannot work without the organizations of the civil society. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels godforsaken, also for the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that takes place on the banks of the Nile with a miscellany of curiosity and tension. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This might turn in its against. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A demonstrator in the square Tahrir warns: &quot;you are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The Norwegian rakfisk: the smelliest fish of the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the biggest standards of living, not only Europe but the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Is it possible that the success of the country keeps some relation with its avidity for an extremely smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of excessively cured cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and humid clothes of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> It leave there one week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> The disabling aroma of the rakfisk will be able then to smell, one of the exquisitenesses of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small city of Fagernes, at approximately three hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It is covered with snow. The scenery is spectacular and this smell, always present, fleet in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is a trout in salting that one allows to ferment in water during, depending on the smelly thing that you prefer it, up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As it darkens and it is doing more cold, the Norwegians come in a mad rush to a festival that celebrates, in Fagernes dedicated to this delicacy of, to say it this way more here, captivating. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;One eats crude oil and then there is drunk a glass of aquavit of a gulp&quot;, says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the &quot;General of the Rakfisk&quot;, who is in charge of organizing the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> For all sides we see the people eating this fish that keeps in small buckets and drinking of a gulp important quantities of the drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some persons like more the aquavit than the rakfisk&quot;, affirms Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I prove some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid to spend it close to the nose, it is not badly; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has covered a few kilometers in bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes of a very different epoch, in which the poverty was flogging Norway and in which, before the refrigeration existed, the fish was keeping during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in full winter, when it is already well fermented, it is extracted and, obviously with the inactive senses due to the alcohol, he eats up. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> A generation does only, thousands of Norwegians turned out to be forced to leave its country in search of work, and emigrated principally to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population is increasing quickly; more than 13 % is immigrant, attracted by the plenty of jobs, high wages and a finished system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> An inhabitants&apos; current of Sweden, the old rival and it even does not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk considers an essential part to be something important, although quite smelly, of the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is between the most expensive plates that can be bought. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a s√°ndwich they cost you the fortune of 10‚Ç¨ ($ 14) each one. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway usually does not appear in the agenda of the international news and most of Norwegians like that this way it is. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here the people are still slightly ready to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist of extreme right that it riddled to shots and murdered 77 persons, between whom there were men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> In its place, they refer to the shooting like &quot;the event of July 22&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> It is difficult to the Norwegians to believe very much that in its calm country one of theirs was capable of committing such a cruelty and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> After a lot of of the current wealth of Norway the growth is, from beginning of the 70, of one of the bigger industries of oil and of gas of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But the oil is not the only reason for which it us goes so well&quot;, affirms Anna, our barmaid, while it is spending rakfisk salvers and who, with its long fair-haired long hair and its surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian well-being. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;We are, as say you, the prudent people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Its English, like that of most of the people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> &quot;We do not like boasting, we do not like the ostentation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil-bearing wealth with great caution; quite, except a small percentage of the money proceeding from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for the sake of the future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis in the whole world, Norway maintained the quite closed wallet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;While we could ski in winter and do senderismo in summer, we are satisfied&quot;, says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And to eat rakfisk&quot;, it adds with a confident guffaw. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow &apos;standing in line to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now an elk hamburger is undoubtedly slightly different and quite succulent that to savor. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the night, it turns this smelly fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel at which I stay is one of many places in which there is celebrated a dinner of rakfisk in which the messmates vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that more puts himself to the test the nostrils. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> A television has tuned in directly to a presenter who goes bow tie and who is surrounded with rakfisk plates. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The Eurovision contest seems. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What are your punctuations for the best fish there above in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here there is our punctuation, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There are laughs and applauses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls down of the chair, perhaps conquered by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps be the steams of all this fish. </seg>

<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been obtaining good economic results during the projecting government of Felipe Calder√≥n, but the country is immersed in a war against the narcotr√°fco who has already received approximately 60.000 lives from himself in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has the big commitment with the Mexican people to reduce the violence&quot;, told Mr. Pe√±a Nieto at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Egg-shaped Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;I am going to propose a new strategy of safety that will allow us to reach this target&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before hobnobbing with the president of the USA, the political experience previous to Mr. Rock was like a governor of its native state, that of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> The very inhabited state and with a rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he usually moved. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A sincere man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic city of Vale of the Brave one, for example, he reminds him to himself tenderly. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attribute to him the merit of the growth of the tourism in the place and of the infrastructures construction. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To come to the city he can drive for one of the new highways of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto, what supposes an enormous progress compared with the highways raw and full of holes that were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Also badges can be seen with its name in the entry of a modern sports center and of an impressive interactive museum on the climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We trust that he manages to realize a real and lasting change&quot;, says its friend and ally political Gabriel Olvera Hern√°ndez delegated of the party of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;Particularly, as for safety and economy, we wait for the interesting and real change that our country so much needs&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the PRI was cleaned out by Vicente Fox in the year 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the presidential palace of The Pines, inside the party there are many expectations with regard to Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It pushes back also the qualification that the opposition does of absence of extract of the new president. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;He is a very sincere, very awkward man and with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He is a fantastic statesman and, over everything, she is a person who can listen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> Nevertheless, to another side of the state this is not the impression that many people have on its ancient governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl known also like City Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Vale of the Brave one might not be major. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under high freeway stretches it is, in many senses, a suburb of the proper Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> At the beginning of this year one asked for the intervention of the military men so that they should help in the struggle against the bands of drug that operate in the quarters and the violence against the women it is especially serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert plot placed along with a dump of garbage, there have been left left in only last two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1.000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe√±a Nieto was the governor, one appraises much higher than that of City Ju√°rez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous of murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto say, ideally, that he could not tackle the problem of the feminicidio while it was in the charge. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The most critical accuse its administration of doing the fat sight. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a house of concrete, typical of the damaged quarter, Irinea Buend√≠a has to do efforts to contain the tears while it shows me photos of its deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of the facts, Marian he committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Nevertheless, its family believes that its couple murdered it. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I came to its house, I seemed as if they had cleaned the body&quot;, remembers missis Buend√≠a. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;There were signs that it had been struck and the rigor mortis had already appeared&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While its mother reports the history, a photo of Marian observes from the walls, along with a cross in which the only word is read: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> Nevertheless, that is exactly what the family says that one has denied to him. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The authorities of the state have treated me as if she was an old tattletale, a rioter, a moaner. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that it is kept silent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that cannot be like that when there have been so many aberrations and so much negligence&quot;, affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential band that the President Pe√±a Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied from an enormous responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens thousands of families have turned out to be affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during its order. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it should be the same type of president who was when it was governing&quot;, says the deputy of the PRI Olvera in Vale of the Brave one. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Nevertheless, this is exactly of what the families of the victims of City Neza more are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not denounce ill-treatment, as affirm the district attorneys </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The district attorneys try to face to the denunciations of abuses of Bradley Manning during its stay in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The judgment centers on the Manning period in the military Quantico prison in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defender wants that the case is rejected basing that the Manning imprisonment was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The district attorneys tried to demonstrate on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning accused of the biggest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment that now it alleges that he suffered while it was under military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During the examination that the district attorney&apos;s office realized Manning in a sight before to the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the district attorney Commander Ashden Fein affirmed that the records of the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any denunciation of the dealing that it was receiving. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The examination, which was carried out during a sight realized immediately after the request of the defense of which the case was rejected since its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already supposed sufficiently punishment, came one day after Manning had attested that had thought of committing suicide while it was arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The analyst of intelligence of the army, arrested in June, 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while it was on duty in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published the material in Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the information source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> On Friday sight, Fein checked with Manning the forms that the officials were refilling after the visits to Manning during its arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where it was imprisoned in diet of maximum seclusion from July, 2010 until April, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials would have realized questions to Manning and noted down its answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When on Friday Fein asked on the forms, Manning admitted that it had qualified the treatment that the monitors were giving him like &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received in the facilities in general how &quot;very professionally&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not show any ill-treatment denunciation, although the officials asked Manning straight on the treatment that was receiving, affirmed Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning answered that it had expressed its worry on some questions and that the officials who were visiting him had spoken about these problems and had indicated him that would talk each other, but that they did not leave steadfastness of these questions in the record. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They were writing &apos;without incidences&apos; (after having spoken about the problems) but this does not mean necessary that I had not mentioned any problem&quot;, said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why it had not denounced the treatment that was receiving during the meeting that took place in January, 2011 with a council entrusted to examine the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning answered that its intention during that meeting was that of obtaining the reduction of the diet of &quot;prevention of injuries&quot; under which it was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military men said that they had made low this restrictive diet, which finds a grade below that of alertness for possible suicide, to guarantee its protection and the safety of other persons. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;He wanted that the biggest state knew that I was well and (wanted) to allow being under injuries prevention... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life&quot;, said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning attested on Thursday on its arrest in Iraq and its transfer Kuwait, where it was retained for almost two months before being moved to the military prison placed in the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered to commit suicide in Kuwait and that in an occasion it lost the knowledge due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said that the fact that he should not to know what it was spending to him or what it was spending in the exterior world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world came down only to the Camp Arafjon, to this cage&quot;, told Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I believed that he was going to die in this cage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning affirmed that, once moved, most of the days were happening to Quantico in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that only it was allowed him to have a mattress, a blanket, a few thongs, something of clothes and its glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He told that all the time was trying to move, since it was prohibited to sleep or even to lie down during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning affirmed that it always had a proceeding light of out pointing at its eyes while he was sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if the monitors could not see the face when it was turned in the night, they were waking up him so that it was turning again. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning presented in January, 2011 a formal claim on the treatment that Manning was receiving. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday the judge asked Manning on an unproved statement that it had realized on Thursday declaration, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep I undress in its Quantico cell, standing desdnudo one forced him during a morning inventory to remain in front of the monitors and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had attested that one had never given him the opportunity to be covered with the blanket during the inventory. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the examination of the judge on Friday, Manning said that it deduced for the order that there gave him the monitor who had to drop the blanket with which it might have been covered, but he admitted that nobody had ordered him to drop it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning attested Thursday that they had forced him to sleep nude the previous night because of an attempt for demonstrating to an official that he did not suppose a danger for himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning affirmed that he had said to the official that it might have used the elastic tape of its underwear or its thongs for autolesionarse but that it had not done it. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning attested that that night they had withdrawn from its cell its underwear, its thongs and its glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Its lawyers have the hope that the judge bears at least in mind the experiences for which it happened during its stay in prison and reduces drastically its judgment in case it was condemned in the military tribunal, which it is foreseen that starts at the beginning of the next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defender affirmed that it intends to do that Manning pleads guilty to less crimes and to defend other too extreme considered accusations. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> It is foreseen that the sight resumes this weekend and one hopes that the district attorneys should argue that the conditions of the detention were well-taken. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has supported that Manning was retained in accordance with the application norms to every arrested who is under maximum care in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, to provoke of illegal form the information publication in Internet, filtration of information of the national defense and theft of property or public records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If it is pled guilty of all the charges, it might face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identity crisis Mexican - American </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He affirms that many turned out to be forced to leave Mexico due to the absence of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans tend to criticize those who went away; he says that they remember the Mexicans of those difficult times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette mentions that the Mexican - American are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> In a recent trip to Mexico City, scarcely it had gone down for the raised area and come to the area of procedure of immigration and it was already completely confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> A few cartels were indicating the way towards two tails: one for &quot;Mexicans&quot; and other one for &quot;Foreigners&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I remained there a few seconds without being sure where it had to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> On having grown in Central California, during all my life they have called me &quot;a Mexican&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is a question of ethnic shorthand, in the same way in that my friends of Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends of New York consider themselves to be &quot;Italian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided on &quot;Mexican - American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> Simply it was American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish. Sufficiently well how to manage during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native one and cannot get rid of my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put myself in the foreigners&apos; tail. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought in that moment of this week in which the elect president of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, visited the White House to meet the President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> In the agenda of the day, like whenever there meet the leaders of these two countries, it was consisting: immigration, drugs and commerce. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Rock Grandson wanted to speak also about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons for which in these moments it is so probable that a Mexican remains in Mexico like which it risks to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to collaborate with the United States and Canada and create in North America a commercial block in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Also, Rock Grandson promised to keep on fighting against the c√°rteles of the drug in Mexico, although it did not give details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and it is full of rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably most of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to transfer half of its territory at gun point. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind it to themselves are throughout. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, in the moment in which an official of the United States says any thing that should bear the most minimal criticism of Mexico, you begin hearing complaints, both in the press and between the elite Mexicans, on how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the Moctezuma children stand up of war. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And nevertheless, for Mexico, the relation that really supposes the whole challenge is the one that there have with more than 35 million Mexican - American who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Do we speak about rancor? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is greatly. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, persons for whom the country provides opportunities and others for that it is not like that. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason for which there are so many persons of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, in some point of our genealogical tree, there was a person, it can that the father or the mother or some of the grandparents, to that the door of the opportunities closed in Mexico and had to go towards the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the times that person was fitting in a certain profile: dark skin, a level of low studies, proceeding from a poor people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are its descending ones and we they are loyal. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> To Mexico not. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, although perhaps we are living now through the American dream, on having gone to good schools and having had good works, we can never lose of sight that through what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our allegiance yes that it it is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Also, we are conscious of that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class they do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us like a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were of a low category of which she is not sufficiently a Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be the sufficiently good thing and our bonds with Mexico will never be sufficiently fortresses. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> To its way of seeing, our existence is synonymous of defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone away. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now we would not be caught after this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, nevertheless, like solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds to me that this rubbing exists between the Mexicans and the Mexican - American because the first ones know with more soundness who are and this bothers to the second ones. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although she is a city dweller of the United States, it is considered to be a part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many Mexican - American that I meet feel that there are no part of any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We like to listen to the Mexican group Tiger of the North, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of every country, but you are not established to any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico they see us as American. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States we are considered to be Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to complicate moreover the things, therefore I have found out during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to tune in again to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want that the Mexican - American work like unexpected &quot;ambassadors&quot; of Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would say to our American partners how fantastic it is to visit this country and would press the political leaders so that they were reinforcing its bonds with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, skylight... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with the inequality of wages, the galloping corruption and the violence for drugs, many of us we do not so are sure that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you are going to remain alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Es justo. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If any Mexicans are still not prepared to excuse the United States by the form in which they treated Mexico one century ago and a half, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican - American are still spiteful for how one treated its relatives it makes less time great. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps let&apos;s be more &quot;Mexican&quot; than he was thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Ham√°s well might be a slightly probable base for the peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will there be able to be any day a lasting peace between Arab and Jewish in Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another blood spilling that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the middle of the useless and habitual discussions on whom did it start first, building heaps have remained limited to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of civil them, and six Israelis have been murdered and, for the first time, missiles proceeding from Gaza have fallen down close to Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in its ancient conflict, everything surrounds them in Middle East it is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab spring has left all made his pieces they liked or not, Palestinians and Israelis have remained caught in the regional clamor. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this does that its struggle is even more bloody than earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Nevertheless, reasons exist to think that its lethal deadlock situation might be refloated. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war it gets lost is not even gained </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first sight, the optimism seems at present very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire stays agreed on November 21, the clashes of this week have reinforced the hawks of both edicts. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The Ham√°s leaders, the Islamist movement that has governed Gaza from 2007, will affirm to have forced the Israelis to move back, although Gaza has received a good drubbing. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And in spite of having killed to some of its leaders and shove to pressure 1,7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the corners most miserable and populated of the planet, Israel could not have finished with Ham√°s. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Ham√°s is gaining area in West Bank, another part of Palestine at present governed by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Also, the Ham√°s leaders might come to the conclusion that the time plays in its favor. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Since the Islamist ones have been gaining influence all over the world Arab, Ham√°s has struck up rich and powerful friendship. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a renascent regional potency that previously had been the Moslem ally nearest to Israel, has embraced the cause of Ham√°s. Also Qatar has done it, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The exultant Ham√°s members say that the Islamist half moon is surrounding Israel, from the Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the party - militia Hizbul√°, happening for Syria, where the rebels of a more and more Islamist tendency might demolish Bashar Assad, up to coming to Jordan, where the Ham√°s Allied Forces are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Moslem Brothers directed by the President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with difference the most inhabited and most fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosny Mubarak, the lay tyrant who governed in Egypt for 30 years up to its fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Ham√°s. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Moslem Brothers are Ham√°s cousins and its leaders depend more of the popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Ham√°s arises like protagonist whom it is possible to exclude, not even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will extract the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In what the military question refers, they have put Ham√°s in its place. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The system antimissile Dome of Iron of Israel has demonstrated its efficacy and many of the missiles of Ham√°s have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will sleep calmer... during some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for the diplomacy, the United States proves to be firmer than never; many European countries also blamed Ham√°s of initiated credit the last violence wave. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjam√≠n Netanyahu, a prime minister who has ignored extensively the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets shot from Gaza have finished with the life of approximately 30 Israelis from 2004, Israel has not had too many suicidal terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes West Bank, the main piece of a suction territory to turn into the state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that they keep on increasing although, according to the international legislation, they are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined a group of an even more hard line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period before to the elections on January 22, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why to spoil these twisted Palestinians giving them the proper state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If really they will govern in West Bank: would not they shoot rockets as compatriots have done its in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them after this wall and to give them a good blow if they raise the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring might alter its calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamist ones that take the power in Egypt and in other places they have no appreciation too much to Israel, its priority will be to tackle the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The budget of defense of Israel is major than that of its four together Arab neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> To initiate a war with the superpower of the area hardly will help the new Arab governments to improve its economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain the cease-fire it is a good augury and it might mark the beginning with something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also the Israelis should think in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of its right to the self-determination supposes creating a powder keg that one day will exploit in the occupied territories for Israel, likewise this week exploited a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already mining the democracy in the Jewish state and the demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to push Ham√°s back will pay an every time major diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both edicts need a push of persons foreign to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution keeps on being the one that there proclaim sensible persons of both edicts, most of the exterior world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory on the part of Israel for safety reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, short-term kidling, is that the cease-fire gives a little more of impulse to the foreign persons who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must begin putting brake to the entry of weapon in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in a situation without precedents to convince Ham√°s that accepts the idea of the Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with ground exchanges and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs foreign to the matter also should press Ham√°s and Fatah so that they join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> He would contribute that more to the creation of the Palestinian state that the imminent attempt of obtaining a category of the virtual state in the UNO. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an important role as for to manage to lead to Israel to the negotiation table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During its first order it omitted to present its own plan for the peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Again in the White House, it seems equal of reticent to dedicate its attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude supposes a deplorable future vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law of generic packaging of tobacco comes into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with illnesses shine on packets of a subdued green color, which are the same for all the tobacco marks </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian law on the subject of tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and the colors of the marks with a bundle of a subdued olive green one, a few frightful images of parts of the body with illnesses and representations of children and sick babies for being children of smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packets obligatory from Saturday, there are the names of the marks, all of them printed on a small type of source. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is a question of the most strict diet of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia affirms that the target is to dissuade the young people from smoking by means of the elimination of the features that do that this habit has glamor. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> He trusts in studies that demonstrate that if a person has not begun smoking before 26 years, it exists 99 % of possibilities that it never does it. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is possible to see that the children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell across its mark&quot;, affirmed the minister of federal Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that were showing, for example, how the girls were relating the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia is provided with one of the smokers&apos; valuations more casualties of the world and that these changes will not affect too much to the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are considering to take similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exercised an enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco companies affirmed that the law would encourage the black market of tobacco, in which the cigarets would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will transport serious involuntary consequences&quot;, said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> There will increase the quantity of tobacco that there will bring the forgers of China and Indonesia to sell it in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Other persons say that its business has benefited after the approval of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a familiar small enterprise, affirmed that the demand of cigaret cases and covering of silicone to cover the unpleasant images of the packets had gone off almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris y Japan Tobacco lost a rejection to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Mrs. There is he affirmed that Zico had sold up to 6.000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;For us it is a good business&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan goes. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws that proh√≠ben the publicity in the television and the patronage of sports and that force most of sellers not to put the cigarets at sight, the marketing of the tobacco has happened to realize in line. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has prohibited the publicity in Internet companies and local web pages, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you commercialize tobacco and only you have left this small window to promote your products, the space in line is the most convincing place in that to be&quot;, said Becky Freeman, researcher of public health of the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman observed a critiques increase on marks proceeding of &quot;citizens of on foot&quot; published on web pages of social networks like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It is necessary to wonder if it is a question only of a private citizen who really loves the cigarets Marlboro and there has taken the trouble to realize a video or if some company of marketing is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry centers more in what it involves the new regulation than in the marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as even to pay so that Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic reject the new norms; these countries are affirming before the World Organization of the Commerce that the commerce is restricted unjustly, although none of these countries has a volume of significant commerce with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is probable that the OMC dictates a resolution in the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek affirmed that the government had maintained conversations with other countries that are considering to apply similar laws on the subject of tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In the year 2001 Canada turned in the first country that introduced the obligatory nature to include images in the packets. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At present they are obligatory in more than 40 countries, between which Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine are. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering to apply harder laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia many smokers prove to be challenging. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;The photos do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Simply I they do not pay attention&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take the cigaret and keep the bundle&quot;, says Victor El Hage while he buys a bundle with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;Sincerely, only there is a reason for which he would stop smoking: for my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the levy King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packets do that it turns out to be more complicated to place them in the shelves to him. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Normally it was taking one hour in desenvalar a delivery; now I take four&quot;, affirms Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have prohibited completely the tobacco and then, it is already, costs, it was finished and we close the shop&quot;, he says while it raises the hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly connected world, to get bored a little is not so badly </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the holidays of the Thanksgiving Day of this year, of unexpected form I had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane in which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to hope that another plane should come. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> To spend noon to him in an airport hoping that it should come a flight is quite boring, enclosed if you have means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting us of the shops duty-free. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But every time there are more academicians and expert in infantile development that the kindness of the boredom praises. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is good that, so much we like our children, get bored occasionally. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> To get bored has to the brain to look for interesting options and it is possible that he encourages the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Since, at present, we are connected most of us to this one or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits that the boredom contributes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So: should we accept of good fortitude the boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, we will speak already about it further on. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, as many people, supposed that, now that we have more time for the free time, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as there affirms Peter Toohey, professor of Greek History and Roman of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book &quot;Boredom: To Lively History&quot; (&quot;The boredom, an animated history&quot;) published in 2011 by yale University Press, it is not like that. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the history of the boredom is very extensive&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> In the walls of Pompeii they exist graffitis in Latin on the boredom that they date of the Ist century A.D. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Also we must appear how we define the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;The problem is that one has already defined and discussed very diverse ways&quot;, indicates John D. Eastwood, teacher of Psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the released investigations and raising the idea before a group of discussion formed by 100 persons, the Teacher Eastwood and its companions defined the boredom as the experience of &quot;wanting, but not to be able, to take part in an activity that fills you&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> He affirms that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person does not do anything but he wants to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> It points out that with the apathy there does not exist the desire to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of the boredom, he affirms, is &quot;the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low frame of mind and with a sensation that the time happens slowly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom can dream terribly similarly to the depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> Nevertheless, the Teacher Eastwood says that, although they could be related, the persons who are bored tend to see the problem like a question of the environment or of the world, while the persons who are depressed think that they have the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when what happens to us in fact is that we have problems to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In its study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, published in the edition of September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, the Teacher Eastwood and its companions were sent to a previous experiment in which the participants were listening to a tape of a person who was reading the article about a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups listened in the contiguous room to a television program to all volume that was not keeping any relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so that scarcely it was perceptible, while the third group did not ever listen to the audio. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group who listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than others two groups; it was difficult to them to concentrate, but they were not sure of why and they attributed it to the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of the attention can lead to the boredom&quot;, indicated Mark J. Fenske, teacher of Neuroscience of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;On the other hand, when you are making something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacture line, a musician that distracts you can help you not to bore you&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;In fact, at present we know that to move or to do scrawls, actions that often are interpreted as a boredom sign, can help to fight it in fact, since they do that this person is physically more alert&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The investigations demonstrate that those children those who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information that those in which one forces them to be calm&quot;, affirms the Teacher Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is to get bored in some moment: the delay of a plane, a monotonous orator, a movie especially boring. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some persons have more tendency to get bored that others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> It to help to measure, some investigators developed in the 80s a &quot;tendency scale to the boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes questions like &quot;many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that I am interested in that I do not have time to do everything&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, teacher of Psychology of the University of West Florida, affirms that, using the above mentioned scales, the investigators have discovered that the boys have more tendency to get bored more often than the girls, and specifically they need more external and more varied stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, the adolescents are a type of group who gets bored with enough facility. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, teacher of Human development and community of the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which it was getting in touch with 400 adolescents and with its parents between seven and eight times a day by means of he looks. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> It discovered that 32 per cent of the adolescents were saying that he was getting bored while it was in the school or doing the duties, while 23 per cent were saying that he was getting bored when it was not in the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 per cent of the parents were saying that they were getting bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> The Teacher Larson said that he did not know if the current percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be top or low. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what yes he knew was that &quot;the adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its higher levels&quot;, largely because both a big control is not given to the children and to the adolescents on what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, returning to my question of the beginning: is getting bored good? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it it is not, since, taken to the end, it can do that we exhibit ourselves to absurd physical risks, like doing bets or falling down in the substances consumption like method to fight it, as they demonstrate the investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak about the connection between the boredom and the creativity, as affirms the Teacher Vodanovich, that he has been studying this question during more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The boredom is the way that has the brain of saying to you that you should be doing another thing&quot;, says Gary Marcus, teacher of Psychology of the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain not always knows what the most appropriate thing is. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and use this energy to touch the guitar or to cook, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you watch TV, it is possible that it satisfies you in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, it is possible that he does not get bored already, but he will not have learned to amuse himself for himself or to be dosed&quot;, affirms the Teacher Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this aptitude to be dosed is applied to other situations&quot;, it points out. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your son not only learns to amuse himself himself, but it learns to be controlled better in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that really let&apos;s want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But neither we should be too critical with him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our target should be, rather, of feeling comfortable paragraphs of the constant rumor of the activities and the technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The teacher Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;To our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but the boredom is a too distressing and worrying desire as to relate it to something that is worth it&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> It points out that for what the people really look is a way of disconnecting and of enjoying a dead time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados&quot;, he affirms, &quot;it is difficult to find ways of centring our attention when the noise stops&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: without instructions book for the new law on the marijuana consumption </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student in a community institute and soccer player of the Southeast of Colorado, faces a penal process for something that soon will be legal in the whole state: the possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pip that it was using to smoke it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco says that one day of September, he and some friends were driving for Lamar, in the flatness near to the border of Kansas, when the police stopped them. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco got a summons for possession of drugs and related articles (crimes less that bear each one a fine for 100 American dollars) in the one that was informing him herself of the date of the judgment. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They treat us as to criminals&quot;, says Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> And are they it? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of suspense following the voting that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the tenancy of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of less causes for drugs tenancy depends less of the law than of the place. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of less crimes by marijuana possession are annulled so much here as in the state of Washington, where a similar measurement was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police officer departments have stopped presenting charges against the persons older than 21 years for possession to small scale, which will approve legally once the law it has come into force in the next weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the most conservative district attorneys of districts of Colorado have promised to go forward with the cases opened by possession of marijuana and they are still quoting persons. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver up to the western mountains, are voting to prevent marijuana shops from being opened, authorized recently, in its communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what the following thing will be&quot;, said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police officer in Dawn, I joust to the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who take charge of the regulations in the state of Washington also him are turning to the matter. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And they keep on looking for advice to establish a system of licenses of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline comes, on December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for good or for evil, Colorado goes ahead of most of the states as for the regulation of the use of the marijuana, first with ends terape√∫ticos and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regular market, so he will be a good guide&quot;, affirms Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Commission of control of the alcohol of the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only do suggestions on what it might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There does not exist a real precedent who serves to us as model&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, so called I-502, comes into force on December 6, what it leaves also one year during which one will swim between two waters, since the licenses system in this state still will not exist, but the possession will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Also, there exist some delicate mechanical questions that must be solved during this period, like the way of maintaining a balance between the demand of the state of offering a &quot;suitable access&quot; to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of realizing cannabis business in a radio lower than 300 meters of schools, parks, infantile areas of game or infantile centers. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;In no place it will turn out to be more difficult to locate a business of authorized cannabis that in the urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle&quot;, says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for the legal cannabis, a group of investigation created recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21, Oates, the chief of police officer of Dawn, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which he was informing them that the district attorney of the city would stop interposing legal actions for light absences for marijuana possession to 21-year-old elderly and that the police would stop presenting charges against these crimes &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The chief of police officer Oates said that they would be in charge of making to fulfill the regulation of the city that regulates the marijuana cultivation with therapeutic ends and that they would keep on chasing to traffickers and sellers of drug. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the district attorney of the district, Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the voting, he made sure that its office would keep on chasing the cases of possession of marijuana, principally to press the consumers and that decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 persons face charges for 56 grams possession or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to interpose legal actions against those absences that at the moment when they took place were a crime&quot;, said Mr. Buck in a declaration. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The answer has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Table, where the voters pushed the initiative back on the legalization of the marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police of Grand Junction, the biggest city of the county, already do not quote adults for possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the district of the county, supported this decision, but also he decided not to reject any of the hanging cases for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think that it is losing the time on having kept on making to fulfill the law until this one changes&quot;, he affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measurement, it was never considered that to take the marijuana consumption for recreational use to the bosom of the government and of the judicial system should to be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The contradictory reactions that arise for the whole state reveal pronounced ambivalence between the officials with regard to the big environmental experiment in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a question of a cultural barrier with the district attorneys of the district&quot;, affirms Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that it represents the accused for marijuana possession and that he is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on the marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent so much time taking the people before the courts that, in fact, cannot accept yet that it is legal&quot;, he affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> To the being the first states that consider the small marijuana quantities likewise if it was an alcohol, Colorado and Washington prepare themselves to turn in the cases of test at national level as for the drugs legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and officials of the state are provided with a new border of legal sales, also they wait anxious to receive indications of the federal government, which still foresees the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana have the hope that the justice Department yields. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although there have taken place some out-standing arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic ends, the federal government has allowed mostly to exist business of sale of marijuana with these ends in Colorado, Washington and 16 more the states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;Although it is probable that the agents anti-drug do not throw doors below to confiscate a bag of small drug, probably they will prove to be unwilling to allow the functioning of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law&quot;, said Kevin A. Sabet, an exadviser of anti-drug politics of Obama&apos;s administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities of Colorado do not hope that they operate the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shop, although about one year will happen before any of them could open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a prohibition of six months and it is probable that it approves the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize anybody and then we should have a serious problem at federal level&quot;, told Bob Nicholson, member of the town hall. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are studying in favor of what he voted for the community opposite to voting in favor of what he voted for the state.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;They harassed me up to beginning of Oxford for being a Tory&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> One does not attack the university students for its view points only now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not remember any moment in my life in which he has not been dreaming of obtaining a square in the Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had been in the one that I supposed it was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary age that was encouraging two props of the civilization: the free thought and the tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Nevertheless, two weeks after occupying my square in Worcester College at the end of the 80s to study the History career, already it had packed the suitcases, what unleashed the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and began to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were disconcerted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard affirmed that I had retired because I was not tolerating that any university partners were maintaining sexual intercourse in the room of nearby. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Writer A.  N. Wilson announced joking that had gone away because they were forcing me to drink in flaky cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less entertaining. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled from there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because she had been submitted to a systematical harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not due to my extravagant name, not to the fact of which it was coming from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> They harassed me for the only reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was turning out to be something intolerant and barbarian: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was an out-standing adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I was supporting to the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Perhaps wonder to what that comes now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new right generation of students of center is suffering a similar pursuit. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The institutionalized and increasing hate towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights that there have the homosexuals, the disabled ones and the ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (students&apos; group of grade) of the Corpus Christi College affirm that they are &quot;often seriously separated, personally irresolute and agreements like not pleasant persons&quot; for its political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a position in the committee of equal opportunity of its university school to insure themselves of being able to express its opinions freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Its situation did not turn out to be favored by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (The paradise: young, brilliant and of rights) on the politics of the students and that was presenting the Tories as eccentrics and neonazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> There was showing to the student of posgrado Joe Cooke, ex-president of the Association of the Conservative party of the Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, showing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, the conservative students say that one treats them like &quot;heads of Turk&quot; for the introduction of higher enrollment ratios. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> 20-year-old Luke Black and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;an increasing lefts tendency exists in the universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people assume that we are like Bullingdon Club without so at least not even to meet us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> 21-year-old Samuel Roberts and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for a major protection, affirms that this ambience is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill and the elect president of the OUCA, affirms that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the persons who are of center a right has deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This supposes a threat for the ambience of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> For my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than the one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered the university in September, 1986, she was a 18-year-old young woman terribly shy. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hate towards the Conservative Party was in its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to Margaret Thatcher, ancient pupil, an &quot;honorary&quot; title after the clippings in the financing of the Higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The ambience had made to shake of fright any Stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students know each other and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that was waiting for me. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors not only were doing the fat sight before the mockery that was done of the conservative university students, but they were taking part in her willingly. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The politics of the strike of the miners, the privatization and the opposition of the government against the apartheid in South Africa came to the sanctions up to the wooden rooms of the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> For the first one that I assisted French texts of the XVIIIth century had to be translated for the Englishman and I was not prepared for what came next. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt&quot;, said the professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), &quot;please, translate the first paragraph&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I did not give not one. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man with a face that was looking like a sponge cake mass, knew well how to expel bad bile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is it that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or it is that, simply, they are dumb?&quot;, he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other university students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I was burned by the eyes of the tears that it was trying to contain. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest him to go to classes of French in its free time, any time it is not too busy knowing the people&quot;, Pitt grunted. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat down alone at the time of the dinner in the university; then I felt a light clapping in the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> He was a student of English of the second year called James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are&quot;, he said to me nicely. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this way it is as the thing goes. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> They get with anyone that is a suspect of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is very complicated, but they know that your father is near to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newly arrived persons to feign to be Labours Parties members&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Further on, in a local pub, I tried cobardemente to pretend. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that it was not agreeing with everything what Mrs. was saying. Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick turned out to be useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student of the first year of Philosophy, Politics and Economy that, paradoxically, he had studied in Eton, said: &quot;You are a daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students adopted this cancioncilla. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I turned into the dirty pervert. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do they have sexual intercourse the Tories?&quot;, he asked about one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;They give a drubbing one to other: no?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt likewise the homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Might it some day to take a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I turn out to be forced to stay with the people who was thinking like me only after the dusk? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Would I have to become a Labour Party member and suppress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Three years that were waiting for me were presenting themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Teacher of Contemporary history destined to my university school. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also adviser of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the persons that they were writing to him its speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Scarcely it was over there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He was detesting the place why Marxist - determinist of the history was considering it to be provincial and insignificant and for its adhesion to the vision. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a chair in the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you are not going to be happy&quot;, he said to me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began moving every day of Oxford to house of my parents in London, finding I shelter in my relatives and friends of more open metropolitan mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I said to my father that he hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He did not believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he was studying there in the 40s, all the political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But if it is the best place of the world&quot;, he said with sadness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;They would never do that, not there between my dear daydream needles. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Up to my communist friends they always had an impeccable attitude&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Its aching eyes began clouding over. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Give him another opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that they have done it only to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> The heart would break me if you were leaving it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also was supporting to the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had resigned from its creed. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which another History professor had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was a &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents me &quot;had washed the brain&quot; and called them &quot;old idiots&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted a little time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university education in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time my father was writing two weekly columns in Murdoch&apos;s press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was closed by key. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was curled up inside of fear and, spent five minutes, my pursuers desisted. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they went away I packed the suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps call me a weeping dweeb. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-old person should turn submitted at such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What turns out to be even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party but, today, he hides after a not deserved at all reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers the elegance to the fame&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Owing to the sample &quot;Valentino: Teacher of the Seam&quot;, that has inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, ancient residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only worth place receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani in the British capital. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has recognized it during the opening of &quot;Valentino: Teacher of the Seam&quot;, a deifying retrospective that assembles more than 130 garments of high fashion created by its &quot;maison&quot; during the last 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I adore this palace&quot;, he says with its unmistakable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This sample is the colophon of a history which only protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but that might not have been written without its distinguished clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always felt fascination for rarefied and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, opened until the next March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most select of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing for the Princess Marie-Chantal de Grecia and Margarita de Inglaterra. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of its social ascent: of humble couturier of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to idol of the international &quot;cream of society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> To be in love of the royalty does not have anything of villain. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least they do not extinguish the butts of its cigarets on your magnificent carpet as they do any beautiful celebrities of the pop music&quot;, says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 60s and 70s, we were living through both in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and he entertains with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;All liked to be invited to its detached house in Gstaad&quot;, tells the exwoman of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, close friend of beauties forgotten like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the fame. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And nevertheless, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the couturier either. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to have dinner to its apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were twenty persons, between whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr were. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the meal, the music, in everything was seen and one was feeling its spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;It did us to each of the guests to feel important and dear&quot;, he remembers it &quot;top model&quot;, that began to work with him during the Week of High fashion of Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;Never fashionable raisin because its designs are works of art&quot;, it finishes off. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Lineage parade </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The Garavani life is not an obsessions history, but of quite corresponded loves. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people with good education and better qualifications, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamurosa by footbridge sixty meters long that proposes a change of rolls: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade the footbridge to meditate to a &quot;hearing&quot; of daydream that shows Valentino&apos;s masterpieces, like the garment that Jackie Kennedy chose for its wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in &quot;The Notte&quot;, or an overcoat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In this manikins public they re-show names like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sof√≠a de Habsburgo. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;impossibly to forget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember it perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was pants, a shirt, a vest &quot;gillette&quot; and a jacket of the collection autumn - winter 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift that he did to me&quot;, says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer it to him over others for its femininity, for its big love to the women, because it heightens our beauty&quot;, adds the ex-duchess of Fair. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like very much the colors that it uses, they have big light and they are &quot;donors&quot; to the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos;Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that a Valentino dressed. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When it was adolescent and was living in Italy, he was dreaming of going so far as to have the age and the occasion to be able to use one of its night suits... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally the hour came at the end of the 90s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my Valentino&apos;s first garment to use in a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red suit, with skirt of demolished, &quot;corsage&quot; drapeado and cut low honor word. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;A made sleep was a reality&quot;, says the widow of Rodrigo d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, its obsession is the atemporal&quot;, tells this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The princess D&apos;Arenberg keeps its garments of holiday of the couturier with &quot;the elegant maxima... because a garment is not only a garment, also it is the set of memories that it bears&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of the fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The big end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in its wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> There were needed four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as the couturier calls its seamstresses) to prepare this silk suit color ivory with incrustations of pearls, twelve different types from lace and a tail of four meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the specializing press, that garment represents a milestone of the high fashion of the ends of the XXth century, &quot;the return of the clients of the high society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obnubilado for years with the &quot;savoir-√™tre&quot; of the elite, now Valentino is its best copy. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere I gave Big Croce (the distinction of higher status in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&apos;Ordre give Arts et give Lettres decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani it accumulates so many honors as any of the husbands of its clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;There has always attracted attention of me its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect aspect&quot;, admits D&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time that I it saw was one month ago in a gala dinner in the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was in the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a big friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was impeccable, the time does not happen for him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If a princess says it... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest office of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano stake the life and the health loading 70 kilos of sulfur across steep stone footpaths </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are the people for whom its work is a hell and other one that, literally, is employed at the hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make the living extracting sulfur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> For it, it has to go down every day up to the fund of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that comes from the entrails of the Earth hardens on having contacted the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After starting big rocks of sulfur, which in whole go so far as to weigh approximately 70 kilos, it transports them in two baskets of bamboo that loads on its shoulders across steep stone footpaths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises up to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes in amounting to snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and measuring with feeling its steps not to slip and to fall down for the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any slip might cost them the life, as it happened to a French tourist that it threw itself over a cliff years ago for the steep rocks of Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen gain 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulfur that they extract </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once above, there make way between the tourists who photograph them as if there were circus monkeys and, loading painfully the heavy baskets, they travel three kilometers up to the scales that a mining company has placed a little further down, to 1.850 meters high. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is a question of PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits from 1960 the volcano and, never rather, to its workpeople, to whom he pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then dynamite sells it for 10.000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the everyday life and is used to make matches, artificial, cosmetic fires, and even to whiten the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;Since the normal thing is to load 70 kilos, we extract approximately 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) in every trip&quot;, tells to us Anto, who usually carries three daily freightages out. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> It is late three hours in each one and finishes ground, but they allow him to join 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it looks like a misery for so inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The day&apos;s wage of the miners is very high here, where the compilation of the coffee is paid to 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) the day and the monthly average salary is two million rupees (167 euros)&quot;, clarifies the porter, that earlier it was employed like bricklayer at the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, its salary was 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the slash was not so hard, but Anto has turned with its family Banyuwangi, a people near to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, turns out to be so forceful as the sulfur: &quot;I married a young woman of Bali, where they are hinduistas, and I have brought it to Java so that it turns to the Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and the eyes get angry him for the poisonous gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At its 27 years, Anto takes three staking the pelt in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun spending invoice to him despite the face is covered with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> It has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and the eyes get angry him for the poisonous gases that the volcano dismisses. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price that must pay to obtain its sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French&quot;, it promises in English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished by the life, this nice and intelligent young man might be a tourist guide, bartender or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of that it does the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop running at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shades, Anto goes down to the crater being lit by a small adherent lantern to its helmet, which he has bought himself with its money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Approximately 400 porters load the sulfur baskets on its shoulders from the fund of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> In spite of its fat benefits, the mining company neither has mechanized the extraction of the sulfur to save costs nor gives any equipment the porters, who work for its account and to so much the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not even see part of 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) of extra charge by camera that, along with the entry of 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the watches of this nature reserve receive from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and to its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the beasts and not for the persons&quot;, there protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old stout porter who takes in Kawah Ijen three decades, since it left the school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, it makes sure that it will last working &quot;everything what could&quot; because he needs the money to educate its three children, of between 18 and 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, die here because the volcano has been all my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burns the gullet and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that go out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complains about suffering serious illnesses... further away, clearly, of its habitual respiratory problems, artrosis, pains in the knees and ulcers in the shoulders, which are existed malformado by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on its back, Unainik can already only load 50 kilos at its 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and its partners start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari store, to 18 kilometers of distance for a way of goats between the weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not retire, die here because the volcano has been all my life&quot;, it proclaims Unainik opening well the mouth, where he lacks several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of its five children, the biggest, of 30 years, also it works loading sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The time happens, but the misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest offices of the world: the one that the human mules of Kawah Ijen do. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looks babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The singapurenses blame to the career, the stress and the cost of the properties and the education for having no children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let&apos;s expire with our civic duty and let&apos;s create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It can seem improbable that these poems are a part of an announcement of peppermints, but in spite of that - or perhaps due to that - the video became viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The phrases are a part of a rap that uses local references as &quot;we Are going to put a bao (roll) in the stove&quot; to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The company of publicity that did the video, BBH, lodges the hope that with the announcement they manage to attract attention on the problem of an entertaining way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of the music so that the people expire with &quot;its national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something purely of Internet, so we had to make it entertaining and graceful. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst of the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was a topic that we had to tackle. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, like throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing parties of rapid appointments (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas can have been creative, but not necessary they worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we think: why do not we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The one that does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends US$1.300 a year in politics to cheer the citizens to have up more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A bundle of the government for marriages and parents it grants up to 15.000 dollars for child, extends the licenses for maternity and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had effect small. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city the State rich and of high technology in the Southeast of Asia, also known by the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control panel. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national population division, is located at present in 1,2 children for woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time that was over 2 - known like restoration valuation - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So: why do not the singapurenses have any more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> So Wei Ming, director of Politics of Marriage and Family of the National Division of Population, says that it stems from a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider scale of opportunities of career&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;That has allowed to the people to have a wider scale of options in terms of targets of life and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family&quot;, he tells. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social norms have helped to the increase of the unmarried state, and to delay the marriage and the births, what it gives like turned out a decrease of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration politics ue top to increase drastically the immigration to face him the population decrease has created resentment between the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore there is web sites where there abounds the xenophobia scarcely disguised against many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, whom they criticize for maintaining the low wages and without integrating. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase of the immigration also is seen like one of the reasons by that last year the party of government of Singapore experienced its worst electoral result from the independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> From the elections there has been an attempt of correcting the problem, with the quotas and higher taxes for the foreign workpeople. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the fiscal income, the sanitary costs and the politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also is having some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries that so many small houses are not constructed. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has begun to affect to the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority of urban development has happened to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;box of shoes&quot;, which could be constructed in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have 46 square meters surfaces and have been very successful of sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is worry of which they could promote an unmarried state life style and discourage the developers who want to construct big, familiar houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Pero Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company THE Developers, says that its &quot;boxes of shoes&quot; sell much more rapid than the biggest units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, to the effect that the units become exhausted days, enclosed weeks, more rapid than the units of major size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This does that it is much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, it admits that the new norms give clearer orientations for the developers, whom earlier it they was restraining if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city the State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the national birth rate, on having spoken with the singapurenses that are employed at the financial district of the center, it seemed that they are no going to have effect great. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are very stressed, the houses are expensive and also it it is the education, therefore many persons are postponing it&quot;, says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other persons can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to be provided with my own money and time&quot;, says another young man of approximately 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention its career, the stress and the cost of the properties and of the education as the motives that children prevent them from having. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, for much that the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it is a question of doing babies, the singapurenses are who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Private off line is deprived on line </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> In accordance with the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy it is a question of the quality of deprived or &quot;the ambience of the private life that it has been a right to protect from any interfering&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is deprived for a 16-year-old minor? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How does this definition apply in its everyday life and in the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Does it understand the dangers to which it is exhibited for ventilating in Internet situations that of course he would not share out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> elPeri√≥dico he interviewed five boys of between ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they associated the term to &quot;slightly very mine&quot;, in the personal plane, and &quot;in the key and name of the user&quot;, when they applied it to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;It would not raise my deepest secrets to a post&quot;, says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of deprived in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has dealings for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;There are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In FB I raise nice images or of games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Also I amuse myself with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;He would not share a photo that is not mine, or of anybody who is disgracing&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child admits that it is badly to publish obscene photos, of naked persons, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assures to meet 35 friends that it has in FB and its nine followers in Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Relatives are the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> El p√°rrafo del Gorjeo de Abr√≠ expresarme y escribir p√≠a interesantes. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I do not know if they answer me, I alone raise them&quot;, it adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;The social networks are entertained, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends of a rapid way&quot;, it indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request of an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He him would not even pay attention to anybody who was recommending him to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of 14-year-old Jos√©, it is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The adolescent possesses accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the last one it admits not to meet 20 of the persons added in its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I do not scare, because we have anything in common, the music for example&quot;, it indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has insinuated him nor has asked him for the direction of its house or its telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they will press me or they were demanding it from me that simply I extract them of my account&quot;, he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jos√© became an Ask follower, after reading a recommendation in Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences are not foreign to the boy about what today one knows like ciberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> My friend they were extorting an acquaintance of one in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They were threatening it and were demanding money from him. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who was&quot;, he makes sure. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jos√©, did not close the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;Only it put privacy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a series of steps to form the account of a sure way. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> In contrast to Jorge, this boy would raise acquaintances&apos; photos in uncomfortable or awkward situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes it would do it, if I do not like or take him desire. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that that is ciberbullying&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Lazy Marielos, teacher of English and Bachelor of Education and Learning, he thinks that to face the children and the adolescents must be understood that the intention of the social networks is to report. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;Internet arose like a way to look for information, but with the appearance of these places they changed the laws of the game&quot;, it mentions. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras points out that the academician Marc Prensky, master&apos;s degree in Pedagogics for the University of yale and author of the work Native and Immigrant Digitalises, minted these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The native digital ones are they, the children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He mentions that the topic is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what it is convenient or not to spread, to publish or to say at an age that the ripeness does not give for that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also that should be selective when what more matters for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences&quot;, it adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way of teaching what privacy is to children and adolescents is across questions across which they make them reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To say to them that it should not do it does not serve&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Next, Porras enumerates some options: There are things that you would not tell to a stranger: why do you do it in Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or: would you like that they publish a photo of you as that you published of a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you label holidays photos: did you ask other persons for permission to label them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And a more: do they all need to know it what are you doing every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them see that they must act as on-line as they do it off line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> There are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One out of Internet operates with respect, morality and other beginning, equal debit to be in the social networks&quot;, he affirms. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Alertness </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guard, university professor, teacher of primary and educational consultant, mentions that it turns out to be indispensable that the family parents read to conscience the politics of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> After each of the interjections understands they have solid essentials to converse with its children on the implications of opening an account in Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or to publish&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> In accordance with Guard, it turns out to be key to remind to the children the lesson of &quot;do not speak with strangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> It finishes Summit of the Unasur without making the Declaration of Lima public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> VI presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima becoming public, announced previously and theoretically signed by seven chiefs assistants. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe tried in repeated opportunities to gain access to the document signed in VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of state and of Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and of Presidency pointed out in a beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closing ceremony, but later they affirmed that in some moment it will be published in the web of the Peruvian Government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> On having been consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exhibited by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief declarations to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of the journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only the video was transmitted, in the press room, without sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;private meeting, restricted audio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Little information that circulated between the reporters was delivered by the spokesmen of press of some of the governments of the Unasur assistants to the appointment, although not the Peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document spread during the day was the list of presidents assistants, what caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists of diverse national and international means who were asking for major information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the means with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is a question of the Humala pronouncement, and not of the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In last October, Peru was the host of III Summit America of the South - country Arabs (SAIL), and in this occasion, despite being needed insistently by the press, neither spread it also called Declaration of Lima that previously they had announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> In the official SAIL web it is possible to corroborate that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities strained in that there were systems of transmission assured for all the journalists but they limited to the maximum the information securing. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit concluded also with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a mistake of the Court of The Hague that dissolves a frontier difference between both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during the regional appointment and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the unproved statements of both parts, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and execute the judgment that defines the differences that today we are taking to this international court&quot;, said Humala, along with its Chilean pair. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, it is and it is going to keep on being a respectful country of the international law, of the peaceful settlement of the controversies, of the agreements and of the international courts&quot;, added Pi√±era, and greeted with a hand hug Humala, along with the flags of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The assertion of both presidents of which they will surrender to the CIJ happened then that Colombia was denouncing this week the Agreement of Bogota for which he had accepted to surrender to the mistakes of this international court, after a decision on marine limits with Nicaragua that he considered to be seriously erroneous. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was realized by the non-attendances of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay suspended from Unasur from 2011 after the removal from office of its ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not take part of the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The president host, Ollanta Humala, was the manager of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after the midday of Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The chief read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines were fixed for 31 projects between the South American countries by a whole for 17 billion dollars in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Between the adopted agreements it mentioned that the UNASUR countries will give &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that actions are impelled to improve &quot;the cooperation in the struggle against the lack of safety in the streets and against the transnational organized crime, actions to make more accessible the medicines, the access to cheap Internet in all the corners of South America, and to attend in a joint and efficient way to the natural disasters risks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With an Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have an euphoric counterfoil but it must serve to extend nustra productive counterfoil and to glimpse a better future for our peoples&quot;, added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and of borders... joining to our countries and generating new economic circuits&quot;, said the Peruvian president in a well-read message. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Between these projects, it mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two point at a major connection with Ecuador, although it did not give major details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country should serve for its reincorporation to the Union of South American Nations&quot;, from which he is excluded at present. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need that Latin America is supported like a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was other of the matters underlined by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before initiating its participation in the regional appointment that was hoping to meet its pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in respectful form the marine difference after a mistake of the CIJ, questioned by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) is possible that it has a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega&quot;, he said Saints. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to check all these ways, they are not exclusive, inclusive the agreement with Nicaragua is going to need a conversation with Nicaragua&quot;, he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;With the president Ortega I hope to be able to say to him that we should handle this of the possible most civilized and respectful form&quot;, it added Saints. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Saints and Ortega would be on Saturday in Mexico where they intend to be present at the capture of control of the new president of this country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, like part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the block met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which thinks about how to strengthen the dialogue and the consensus on the subject of Defense in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency pro t√©mpore of the regional block. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn of Europe to integrate a citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case yes, must learn of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Thong, which took part in VI presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), celebrated in Lima, Peru declared to the state TV that the Europeans &quot;killed themselves in the Second World war&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now there are practically a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> It defended, in this sense, the project to establish the South American citizenship that the member countries of the Unasur encourage. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to obtain the free mobility of citizens and workpeople for any South American country, as it happens already with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that they want to return us to the past&quot;, he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadoran president appeared, also, in favor of the repairing of the Organization of American states (OEA) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and bearing in mind to those who have signed the agreement of San Jose on the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who never give chair commit themselves to nothing and, on the other hand, we the South American ones sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States&quot;, he affirmed in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Thong made sure that it is not regretful of this decision because with it he has not betrayed its beginning, but he has respected its &quot;deep democratic values and of human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that, in its moment, &quot;there were founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process was not respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, also, the Swedish justice for demanding from him that he should surrender in its territory to the examination for a sexual alleged offense when &quot;the proper Swedish legislation allows to realize it by means of videoconference, which might be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Thong affirmed that there exists the risk that there deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken with him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had a small pulmonary, problem not serious at all&quot;, said the Ecuadoran chief. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What yes exists is the danger of that spoils its physical and mental health for being shut up in a small space without being able to do exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That complicates the health of any person&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Thong pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange from June in the Ecuadoran embassy in London, by means of the authorization of a salvaconducto who should allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European juridical authorities and underlined that there have been conversations with London in search of a solution to the sit-in of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution of this problem is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and of the European juridical authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garz√≥n, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances&quot;, it mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thought that &quot;if Great Britain gives tomorrow the safe-conduct this is finished&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, since perfectly its legislation allows it and since it has done in other cases, interrogates mister Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates it route Skype tomorrow the same finishes this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Thong was useful to be reaffirmed like a defender of the freedom of the press and tinted that what he does not tolerate is &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, which spoil the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press we are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists according to the lucre, the blackmail and the extortion&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect one congratulated that they are already these journalists &quot;neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries those that dominate Ecuador&quot;, and moved forward that of being re-elected &quot;it will study in depth the revolution to continue the way and the correct direction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Thong also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next elections, on having argued that the organism &quot;must be a road surface and not tolerate the opportunism and the tendency towards coups d&apos;√©tat covered with legality&quot; because in fact &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadoran president considered, also, &quot;perfectly pertinent&quot; the desire of its Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, of negotiating now with Nicaragua the marine limits between both countries after the mistake of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which he benefited to the Nicaraguan marine sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the time being this mistake is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and the Central American one. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is necessary to process them of wide form to overcome them and to go forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Also he trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for marine limits that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and thought that &quot;it is correct for Latin America to look for international instances if two countries promise to accept mistake for five-peseta coin that is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the contingency that should present itself as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to look for a third consecutive order it pointed out that it sees this possibility &quot;with very much optimism and happiness, although sometimes it is quite hard&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Thong made sure that if it loses the elections of February, 2013 it will move back from the social life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> In the personal thing I have never been interested in the power, but in situations as unjust as that of Ecuador this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that was I who was guaranteeing this probable victory, since we have to accept this reponsabilidad&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Of winning it would be my last period in the presidency and hence we go out of the social life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose equally. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is a decision&quot;, he affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Thong referred also to the new treatment of health of the Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicol√°s Maduro and he says to me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, of routine, which waited that the campaign should happen to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It does not mean a relapsing in the state of health of the president Ch√°vez&quot;, he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadoran head of state took part today in Lima in VI heads of state Summit and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with called a major regional integration to support the progress, the equality and the safety. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Deaths for been today are a cause of late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio had 21 years of age when they confirmed to him the result of the test: Been positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb was falling down&quot;, it recounts on having recalled the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make &quot;a more suavecito&quot;, without clear success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy concealed it from its family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take alone charge of its illness and began to find out on her; with such a determination that 43 already celebrated its birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is, undoubtedly, one of the most ancient patients of the Unit of VIH of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult of imagining at the beginning of the 90, when there were many doubts, few options of treatment and more through stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, up to the director of a clinic of the IMSS he avoided to say goodbye of him &quot;because it was bringing the cut one&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, to have been was synonymous of death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do it with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, ignoramuses of its illness, many persons still come when the virus has already caused ravages, &quot;exhausted&quot; its immune system and infections victims are opportunists. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> To 31 years of the appearance of the AIDS in the world, at least of the first brought cases, &quot;the big achievement means in this moment that the sobrevida of a patient who initiates treatment in opportune form and the sobrevida of the general population, is exactly equal&quot;, indicated the chief of the Unit of VIH of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after recounting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infect√≥logo and expert in VIH/sida, Andrade Villanueva mentioned that from the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that the AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of sobrevivencia and the quality of life depend on the affectation grade to the immune system that the patients present on having initiated the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drugs users: of up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and of 50 years, when there bring 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple words, the previous thing means that who receives the diagnosis of positive VIH at the age of 25 from age, under these terms &quot;while it is supported in control he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years&quot;, the interviewee explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For dimensionar this advance, it is necessary to remember that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is 76 years in average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality has gone down significantly in the last years, in case of Mexico, the number of persons who die of AIDS lowered of 6,678 cases in 2007 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), also it is true that from the appearance of the AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Straw hat 255 persons died in 2011, and 187 deaths go until May of this year; nevertheless he makes sure that there is universal access to the medicines antirretrovirales from 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why do keep on being deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - It seems to me that the problem does not perform access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This way I visualize it, this way it has happened to us in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have not had medicine shortage the problem is that the patients come very advanced because they do not know its infection state, or, in late stages of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gave a forceful fact: &quot;Nine of every ten patients come when they already present some infection opportunist what it is necessary to do to have a major impact on the global mortality, it is to do earlier diagnoses and there have to seek employment tests of detection of a massive way, to all the persons who need it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal there coincide specialists and officials of the State Council of Prevention of the AIDS with Straw hat (Coesida), also the proper patients, as Fabrizio, who came to do the test to himself to a particular laboratory, only motivated because it had made a friend and, despite its young age, already it was in stage of AIDS and he even endured sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have been. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some of them think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am already going to die, better I burst three times a week&quot;, they say not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, I feed well, do exercise, take the medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To the date, its parents only know that he endured cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live through a normal life, like any. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, have a lot of activities, travel, have an active, but jointly responsible sexual life, look after me and another person&quot;, there enumerated Fabrizio, who accepted to share its intimacy with MILLENIUM STRAW HAT to explain by its testimony those who today, in the frame of the World Day of the AIDS, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> That do the test to themselves, if they had risk, which between more soon they know if it is positive VIH, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, which they learn that they can live like any person, being persons in charge. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> That one, its message, he sums the battle motto up to the AIDS this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms after the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Big are the hollows that exist between the programs of health and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who has assumed the cause concerning the VIH. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the places dedicated to this task &quot;really the condoms share-out has increased, earlier they were giving to us of one or two, now bundles give us of to hundred, and that is very well but it turns out that there are those who today, yet, have no access to a condom&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Between the most vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you want them?&quot; it is a common question, with sarcasm and value judgments of social workers, orientadores school, used of drugstores and personnel of health, to which the adolescents do not want to be exhibited, the communicator assured. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to reorient this ineffective share-out; that the condoms are not only after the counters and this hundred are in dispatchers of public baths of the places that the young people frequents. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not to motivate the promiscuousness. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not even a question of paying the beers and the motel to them, as answered the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez, on having asked him if there would be condoms share-out in its Administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This way it is not the sexuality, the best thing is to bring the condoms over to those who already practise a sexual activity&quot;, it pointed. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Keys In Straw hat </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 piled up cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of VIH). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is 4 ¬∞ national place in new and piled up cases of AIDS and 13 ¬∞ of VIH. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92 % of the contagions corresponds to the sexual route, 6 % to the blood route and 2 % to the route perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is believed that 50 thousand persons can be living with VIH since for a registered case there are from 4 to 5 persons who do not know it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a court of appeals of the United States a judgment that he does not know restructures of the debt of the Group Vitro successful route a mercantile contest in Mexico, a pernicious precedent places the stage for any domestic enterprise with ramifications in the nearby country that has problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It would be said, then, that the procedures in guarantee of sobrevivencia of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, unwillingly of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In the practical area, the recognition to the judgment expressed last June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bankruptcies for the north district of Texas, leaves defenseless to the Mexican signatures opposite to the possibility of sequestration of its properties in allende the Brave one. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> Nevertheless, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> Of entry, while the judge of the cause points out that the creditors must be ruled by the Law of Failures of the United States, the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit, with head office in New Orleans, he says that the main procedure is the mercantile contest proceeded in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would not imply knowing the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, towards this end there was created the Law Model of United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial law, being placed like umpire American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the vote intercompanies recognized in the critical mass of the mercantile contest the debts that had with its counterfoil the Vitro branches, the majority had not been achieved needed to pass restructures it. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Nevertheless, the Mexican laws recognize the possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There half a dozen of examples is, between them Agremex and Commercial Mexican, whose debts intercompanies it endorsed the Federal Institute of Mercantile Contests. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> The true thing, also, is that reducing the votes of the branches, anyhow the Vitro creditors that there fought against this one in the Spanish Parliament of the United States, that is to say the funds &quot;vulture&quot; like Cardinal Aurelios, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, they will not have achieved majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The voting would have been 45 per cent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The fact omits the Court of appeals. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another angle, this one blames Vitro of the difficult situation that it faced from 2008 to soslayo of the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, giving him the wags of the tail to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the prompt thing, the signature of the family Gonz√°lez Sada will interpose a reconsideration resource before the proper court of appeals so that the voting comes to the plenary meeting of this one, that is to say five magistrates, since only they voted for three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> Of not prospering this one will claim the resource of Cerciorare that demands the review of the process on the part of a top instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The serious of the case is that the court avoided a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;), in which there is detailed the procedure continued by Vitro under the frame of the Law of Mercantile Contests, pointing out that this one let off steam with fidelity to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this one with the chapter 15 of the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Even more, it is indicated that the country folded at the beginning of the Commission of the United Nations for the International trade, that is to say the rules fixed for cross-border cases of insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Kings: &quot;The basketball has been my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Vagrant of the basketball H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Kings was more than 60 years tied to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, the whole world traveled. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few persons in Puerto Rico it has a mental compilation of the history of the local basketball as wide as H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; has His Kings. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And the fact is that before a brain haemorrhage was confining it in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was like a player of less categories, a player of the National, authorized and leading Top Basketball in the BSN with the Jeans of Bayam√≥n or president of the Federation of Basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I put myself many hats in the basketball across my life, including several to the same time, as when I was a president of the BSN, a general manager of the National team and a federative president during the 90s&quot;, he resembled Kings during a visit of the First Hour its hearth in Bayam√≥n, where it resides with Elizabeth, its faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;The basketball has been my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Kings it does not exaggerate on having done this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of its house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote its wide trajectory, this way testify it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all, which it hoards with major emotion are those who recall its step along the Jeans from middle of the 50s like player until 1982, when it was 15 years acting as a coproxy or proxy of the exemption. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;These were my best years, which more I enjoyed to myself because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight championships of the Jeans from 1967, he was already like a proxy, coproxy or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of satisfactions, including five championships covered from 1971 until 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of d√©but of Jerome Mincy in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Hence from now on there took &quot;Pretty&quot; charge Ortiz, who was a big manager&quot;, it indicated Kings. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot;I have a quite strong player to you, of 6&quot; 7 &quot; of height. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who has had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best knobs. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help to bring another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the Jeans with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at the distance, since for 1988 it was already appearing of federative big shot. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> For this time he preferred to enjoy its accomplishments and those of Mincy in the National team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we win for the first time the United States during the PreOlympic one in Mexico of 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there came the World cup of 1990, where we come the fourth place and it was necessary to have been a bronze of not being for that Canadian umpire for whom it made us repeat the final move for the second time, he said Kings. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Is this group of the World cup of 1990 the best National team that you have seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is between the best, just as the one that won Dream Team in the Olympics of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was that of the Pan-American ones in Cuba in 1991, when we gain gold and we gave him one he peels the team of the United States, which was quite similar to which it gained us the bronze in the world cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> That team not only was repeating Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and &quot;Picul√≠n&quot; (Ortiz), but also it had to (Javier) &quot;To√±ito&quot; Columbus young and James Carter, to the brothers Le√≥n (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario &quot;Quixotic&quot; Mulberry trees, which it could not have been in 90 due to an injury in the knee. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that perhaps was not the best in personnel terms, but it gave us a golden medal and a big happiness was that of the PreOlympic one of 1995 in Neuqu√©n, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players of roll like &quot;Canito&quot; Snow, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the foul-up of the Pan-American one of Mar del Plata, we gain gold against all the prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Which has the best player of Puerto Rico been? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Undoubtedly, this has been Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its numbers at level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as it made it Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that without counting its trajectory in the different leagues that it played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who has the best leader been boricua? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> That one is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a very good litter that there includes to Julio Toro, Flower Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the young people, I like very much the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you consider your biggest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> To have been a part of the most glorious age of the National team between 1988 and 1995 and that to beginnings of the 90 the BSN it had up to 17 teams in a period. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What had you left for doing? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that he had wanted to implement, like the regionalization of the least categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that the boys of alone Ponce will play in its area and they will only face teams of other corners of the Island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Right now the children travel and play too much of unnecessary form. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruit of the compulsive certifications and study for leaders, officials of table and umpires. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I like that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> More that I do it is to listen to music, to see videos of the music of my epoch in YouTube, to enjoy me to my grandchildren and occasionally to go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And skylight, to enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2932"> Its work in the movies included roles well got for the criticism in &quot;The Group&quot;, &quot;Harry and Dumb&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But its magisterial interpretation was of charmingly a detestable J.R. the one that took Hagman to its maximum stardom. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of the chain CBS on the clan Ewing and other personages in its orbit was to the air from April, 1978 until May, 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The promotional phrase &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;, thought to generate expectation concerning a full episode of emotions in which the Hagman personage almost is murdered, it generated an international speculation and million dollars risked in houses of bets. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Also it helped to give him to the series a hearing record in this epoch. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November, 1980, an average of 41 million viewers was syntonized by them and they turned &quot;Dallas&quot; into the second most seen program of entertainment of the history, behind the end of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had 50 million spectators. </seg>

<seg id="2939"> J.R. embarrassed it and then he threatened her to correct it of prostitute unless out of the city, but others also had motives for attacking it. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman interpreted Ewing as a corrupt insatiable one with a charismatic smile: a tricky businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried that its alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was interned. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what I want in the J.R headstone&quot;., said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> He should say: &quot;Here the honest citizen J.R lies. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only one he negotiated that it lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered on Friday Hagman like someone &quot;enormous, inside and out of the screen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for million admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to know it and to love it. </seg>

<seg id="2963"> Pero Charm√© had no idea from what he was expecting for him in the following pair of months: The catacl√≠smico hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some of them have called &quot;deudarmaged√≥n&quot; and an increasing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the theoretical Christians of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I did not realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that has existed&quot;, said Charm√© this week to the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>

<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, theoretically the last one of the history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Tempering, the assistant professor Barry Vacker is giving the course &quot;Means, Culture and the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, the students explore apocalyptic topics as the nuclear war, the zombis, the viruses and g√©rmenes, and the global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why these ideas proliferate with the time&quot;, he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical stages that guide certain human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material comes across, for example, a war might explode. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic topics and explored how they are compared with examples of the real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible&quot;, said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the teacher of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and its companion Amara Solari, teacher encloses of Art history and Anthropology, they have done team to give a course, titled only &quot;The end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012&apos; always to be always provided with the option to give the course again, in case the world is not finished&quot;, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent ruin&quot;, the students must study, generate projects and take final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In Penn State, the final examination will be taken just before the Apocalypse, what does not leave to the students another option any more that to be employed &quot;until the same night at that one is supposed that the world ends&quot;, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses turned out to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was saturated in two hours&quot;, said Restall on its course for students with average high place, which filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We receive messages by e-mail for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of persons who were asking if there was still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students for his part, make sure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It turns out to be fascinating to me to see what the persons do to console themselves themselves&quot;, said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the career in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And the fact is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, it is only a question of consolation or of the absence of the same one. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Infirmary, of 25 years, said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;He had never listened on a class that could teach that&quot;, it indicated. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project treated on the Mayan prediction and of certain way we discredit it&quot;, said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Tempering, of 21 years and of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayan never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But it annotated that an apocalyptic anxiety exists in the western culture, which goes back to several centuries, in which the people react to the changes around him predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Internet has caused a heyday of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other sides the people do not think about this&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In mainly in the world of English speech. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of religion of the University Le Sal who gives courses in the Philippines this year, answered quickly to the question if he knew on some course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not take part in the end of the world&quot;, he wrote, insinuating an exception of a top authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon of the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall made to notice that throughout the years one has spoken about many doomsdays, and said that if it does not spend at all December 21, &quot;the people will begin to think immediately about next date&quot; or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will be finished. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said that they think to go to holidays &quot;of the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Perhaps call some friends so that we laugh together&quot;, mentioned Samira Ford, student of communications of 20 years. </seg>
