<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies, with the need to combat election fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center, the latter for a myth, it confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the strikes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada, the US states for the conduct of elections in the individual states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of american governments since 2009, new laws announced that the procedures for the registration or the ballot difficult. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010, in which new 675 republican officials in 26 states has been registered. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters a Lichtbildausweis and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws that also shortened the period for early voting, the right declared invalid, as voters to register on Election Day, and citizens denied the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants a Lichtbildausweis can boast. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana is the first state that such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to this practice in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years promoting it in 34 states, bills with which voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec is not on the cards as a universal health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, i. e. no vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued Lichtbildausweis their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are, however, often more than a hundred dollars to pay the required ID. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are seen as voters their voice more to democratic candidates, it is in a number of states do not allow their of their establishment Lichtbildausweis issued to use. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of Angel Jagdvereinen-or, more to the republican side to choose from these clubs issued cards for elections to use. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state of the voters asked for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state that such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, which voters demand that they prove their US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at the hispanic votes to limit. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is clear that two out of three hispanic voters to the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, republican legislators in 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day was abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Also, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters to provide support to the register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaign for the registration of voters in the general election in 2004, helped to around 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of recording Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, african-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same is true of the hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> A number of bills have been through the veto of the democratic governors blocked. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in the most controversial pieces of legislation. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require a Lichtbildausweises colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear goal of influencing the outcome in key states for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to a greater reluctance of the men already undecided for the implementation of Früherkennungstests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have the views of two doctors. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States, insisted many confounding factors between the control, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases by 30-40% higher if there is no screening was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, already in the prostate cancer was diagnosed. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men in african-american origin, there is also a greater risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right choice as soon as a cancer diagnosed. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that aggressively and others, the indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient, the extent of the risk of his cancer really was made clear by the possible options, in which Prostatakrebse remain untouched if the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, for many men, the cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active monitoring them and give them in advance of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> It is most important, but with his doctor to talk in order to determine whether he should be carried out or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for Movember Urologie has developed a device with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded at the following address: http://about.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research is adopting a healthy lifestyle, the best way to minimise the risk of it becoming ill. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and get enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> “If there are no more smokers, this value at at least a 50% increase,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian Krebsgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several also remain unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> “Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem to be the risk of breast, Grimmdarm-Mastdarm-Speiseröhren-neuronal and uterine cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> “The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects”, he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In great quantity, it increases the risk of a fairy tale or of becoming ill. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by smoking or drying Salzen can lead to formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> “The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, a number of scientists, the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Your investigation, but is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> After the canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E, contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While the study may reduce the risk of prostate cancer has discovered a different, more of an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family kind. </seg>
<seg id="103"> “The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer.” </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs Boson analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain amount of consternation, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is thought that in fact, this Boson in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all the objects in the universe is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And finally, this is the final piece of the Standard Model, the existence of our best-or “least bad” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter-predicted, but still not empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model strongly resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data this week at a big physics-Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still missing data about completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Nevertheless, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk, to deceive, and let us see what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world, there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects, not at the same time in the same place may be present. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible, against this rule to breach and you try not to, as you will hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Because even if the particle really is a strange world, it turns out that, for them, such a law also applies: the Pauli&apos;s Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles do not have the same room at the same time if they are unable to fill in the same “Quantenzustand”, with a “state”, by and large, from some of its properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Assuming the particle physicists share in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, the good citizens of the Fermione be described as polite and Pauli-the principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that, in fact, they are at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These Bosonen are based, according to the website of the Particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen here, we will not be dealing with and the “Kraftteilchen”, through which the great forces of nature and spread of the Higgs Boson somehow would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen such exotic creatures are, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this chronicle of, then it is only thanks to a Bosons banality of exceptional: the Photon, or the “Lichtteilchen”, “the messenger” of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electrical load faster or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place “disrupted”, such as a pebble in a pond was thrown. </seg>
<seg id="122"> By this “disturbance” created an electromagnetic wave, infra-red light (or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon and therefore one of the “Bosonen carriers of the force”. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same goes for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, “disrupted” that must be the Boson shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the magnetic field, the virus has to be very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Why is a giant like CERN particle accelerators, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km, to such energy to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again to help the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd to explain. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never even a piece of paper from the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And, equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field, those that do have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the Photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For what can all this research now “be good,” says Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science, they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all variations between the observations and predictions of the SM to investigate. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such departures, otherwise the slightest difference a door to open a “new physics” and the model could plug some holes. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe-ups (again!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, the CERN such deviations, until now, has not been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that we do not have. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs-not suspect that their work such a revolution would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle-in the Bell Labs has worked, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed-said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a “Laborspielerei” was considered. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine … </seg>
<seg id="142"> Moreover, applications from all the instruments, the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics of a small Lichtsensor developed. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras around the world as the “eye” and gave him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really can never know … </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care-the best way to die … &amp;pipe; Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its committee for “death with dignity” Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of Lebensendes. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must soon be resumed, although a bill being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this very important subject much still to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir, has tried to look as this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer he aufzehrte, he had a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> “They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed,” he said, half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, lying, in which he reached the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> “However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared for,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents alone to use the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> On the table sits a delicious lunch, he resigned to take a dinner help. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageously he manages to smile and even with strangers, which is around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> “My greatest wish is that one of my cure diarrhoea, as this is humiliating,” he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> “In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt,” Brodeur told Pierre, a psychologist in the home-Victor Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> “It depends on the ability of the person,” a step back, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people involved in the work of the palliative care to find big events in the middle of these setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois be sent, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> You have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called “curative care.” </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, “deliberately and by suffocation” to die. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But as a result of the disease, I really got to know my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> “I have good children,” she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> “I have no wishes more in life,” she says, before they accepted that if a mask of her injury, her breathing helps. </seg>
<seg id="172"> You expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the home-Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance in the diet. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care is then used when there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to make the deaths more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, 11.700 residents on a bed for palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> That is very little, considering that one day we all will die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This is the life in the best possible conditions continue, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It grants the wishes of a dying depending on Mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics need their Blutzuckerspiegel no longer control. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we have X a beer served during the night has died. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son the beer at the feet of the deceased austrinken. </seg>
<seg id="185"> “We help relatives and patients alike,” said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the home-Victor Gadbois is not a day as the other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man from 93 years ago, which is the last in the courtyard Familienzusammenkunft enjoys and well supported by his pillow, but his motion, dies in honour of a young man from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> “For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years of evidence,” Dr. Christiane shares with Martel worries. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the home-Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i. e. a care to ease the suffering of patients, if they have reached the last stages of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And a number of organizations, such as the home-Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize in more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> These very serious shortcoming in the care of Quebec ensures that several of them in the palliative care specialist doctors, the adoption of a law on euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto circulated by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to its objection to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec, the health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was without measures to alleviate has taken. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the patients just want to die because they lack adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts fought until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they broke off a difficult chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was in the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the staff that this desire is not granted, after their pain eased by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that the palliative care in Schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After Elsie Monereau, head of the society of the palliative care home palliative care Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients on a Schmerzbehandlung. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, the doctors so often on the terminale Sedierung back, leading to the patients either sporadic or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief, increasingly have the possibility to these terminale Sedierung resort. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients, the pain will not be eased, all say the same thing: “I want to die.” </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, “I want you to put to me,” but, “I would like to see my pain.” </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was made possible because of a canadian Journalismusstipendiums Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale Immobilienskandale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the company, the Straßenbauamtes Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer, political parties and specialists of the italian mafia tell every day, they know a great “system”, in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are enmeshed. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An “industry” to the taxpayer of Quebec was very expensive, especially in the 1990&apos;s and 2000&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> “It is strange how the system is unraveling, since then it has taken drastic measures,” Jacques witzelt Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and a former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was it based on a thorough study of the incidence of fraud in connection with contracts to Straßenbauarbeiten revealed in Quebec, the then-Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed to. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between the industry, the secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> “Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,” he said, “the Department of Transport had only a billion dollars to the Treaties saved” because some zügelten squandering their instincts, in order to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission “has already made two mayors,” he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in “the tactics behind the individuals show.” </seg>
<seg id="220"> A 2011 launch, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit </seg>
<seg id="221"> The 2011 launch, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit doing with their troops to accountants, tracking down and analysts of the government too much effort. </seg>
<seg id="222"> In addition, the officer “Marteau force”, which since 2009 has ensured that the “Kanalisationskartell” Montreal in artificial inflation of contracts more going on … </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks it has carried out a series of raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city, has resigned. </seg>

<seg id="231"> Kanalisationsverträge, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the “system” of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant, before the Commission described in detail: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and-to the tune of $736.000 bribes in return for Kanalisationsverträge whose cost it artificially inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that they could grease the bills with false benefits artificially by 30-40% aufblähten. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, the organisers of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with illicit funds. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these disclosures is Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, with Montreal in a severe crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the proposed raising the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the Stadtbezirks Rivière-of-Prairies, in the east of the island, rejected from 2010 on the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that for $5 million and acquired for 1.6 million of real estate developers in the booming housing market has been sold on. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of black money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation, which is being carried out at the end, she says, “on a cord, which allows for the operation of the suspected of ant system to understand the problem and stop the perpetrators of shame”. </seg>
<seg id="241"> It says that the procedure “painful, but positive.” </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are going to need to clean up the wound, but only for certain Montreal fraud investigation unit, as well as a supervisor for a return of the questionable practices to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, notes that “officials of several hundred million dollars have stolen”, but, above all, reflect on the role of the “elected officials about the tactics in the picture” if it is not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> On the basis of a 70% of illicit funds in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec witzelt he: “I have been told that this is a poor simulacrum of reality.” </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government is proposing that the donations to parties at 100 dollars to limit what he says nothing about the situation would change: “as long as the spending limit is not strictly limited to black money in politics in circulation.” </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system of procurement and the financing of the parties: “we cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage to the bottom, we can the House on a more solid footing with more controls and laws to rebuild.” </seg>
<seg id="249"> If the history of the international reputation of Quebec and the Montreal damages, calling for Mr Duchesneau those who laugh, a look in its own backyard to throw … </seg>
<seg id="250"> “PSG is not the FC Barcelona!” </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How would you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can make it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am making progress on its side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff has given me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements will spur me on to my Spielniveau every day to improve. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game that is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything is very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I will not stop in excitement. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training the INF Clairefontaine until my Spielzeit in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You are thus by Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition advantage … </seg>
<seg id="263"> The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> You also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that, as a player, I have to stand up to and doing his best wishes. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Incidentally, it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in relation to my Spielposition. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is co-coaches as Claude Makelele, helped in the same position as I played. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti instills respect all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, at the moment, there is no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs won. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the time, I was a Verletzungsserie recovers. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What are your thoughts on the first part of the season, the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of us Spitzenreiters. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lie in wait. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way for the final 8 qualified. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try, as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we are against very good teams our input. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want to lead our group in Porto, so that we have the return leg of the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as possible. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG in the short term, a major european club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already had its budget … </seg>
<seg id="289"> A major european club, Paris title to win and in the long term a name. </seg>
<seg id="290"> That is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really at the heart of this title, cream off. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were sealed off. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed because we have been strong enough for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally you should be master with 79 points … </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this is the right thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in the title fight, I believe that we have the tools to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media is too much to expect from PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept that entirely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, when we are in a Heimspiel against Troyes 4-0 win, and we still find something we can reproach, is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons, for the final 8 to qualify, and also the huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed on your time out with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the french championship ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new “PSG geboostet.” </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that, in the month of May, the winner will be smiling and tell us that, despite the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems full of performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to depend. </seg>
<seg id="320"> All the better, to be a “Zlatan-dependency. </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scoring many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he came, and he shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has shown that he&apos;s a great player and a world star with respect. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respected the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to her Spielniveau to improve. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world is, it allows all other also to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you Euro 2012 with the french national team experience? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was anxious to take part in this match. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented something Spielzeit party. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things, from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I find it good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> That was my baptism with the “Bleus” my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps, at the top of the “Bleus”? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not want to see a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its objective, we had qualified for the championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps, the “Bleus” will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Put on October 16 in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has been for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the meeting in Spain, I have never had a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank </seg>
<seg id="350"> The reverse of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as so often in these technologies to a political vision tangible: the belief that the current Bankmonopolen shaped monetary system, leading to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin, a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.), as well as a record for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer file. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand websites than accept Bitcoin donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of 30 euros ($23), had succeeded, it had fallen five months later, at $2, before today to around $10 has recovered (the courses are on the website listed bitcoincharts. com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes as “the Bitcoin virtual currency with the greatest success,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to the traditional currencies.” </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that will be used to make progress in a video game, which is winning games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, each time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all at the same time, Rechnungsbuchs Netzknoten repositories of the auditors, money-issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Where is this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the users pay for each other to be able to choose what the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of the associated with this transaction data electronically through a double cypher system signed. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the volume of Bitcoins in the whole network Rechnungsbuch widespread public accounts are available. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is to ensure that these new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task on computers will be launched, with the winner, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is the privilege has the additional line added. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, i. e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computer “take” the new transaction and do a number, before the whole “chopped up, covered in quicklime.” </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to be number one, to find a special fingerprint (many zeros at the start). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions linked, and any modification of the fingerprint would change. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user to Betrügen twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, was only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, because they both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which the task, receives 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation will reward this regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The Bitcoins are in circulation, bringing to 21 million, but limited to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room … </seg>
<seg id="380"> In addition, the difficulty of the task, with any improvement in as much computing power as increased. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The lives of the network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-deposits stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> “The used weakness concerns not the underlying protocol,” assured Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced, a company to pay with real money is and the network of Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reports on the potential of the anonymous money laundering through this service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, cash also these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog platform WordPress will accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, FDI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Rechnungsbuch analysed and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins will not be in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, a “mega-Schlussverkauf”. </seg>
<seg id="390"> “Dreißigtausend dollars have been exchanged,” Holmquist, Jon is happy for the company, which operates Coinabul Bitcoins convertible into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this currency is, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system Paytunia corresponds with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but using Bitcoin validation of the transactions that it is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, managed the holders of its identity and, therefore, can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can easily be implemented the traders, and the latter have no new terminals or install programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They simply need to give an address, a phone “photographed and identified,” Pierre Noizat is the assurance that it has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> It is a general trend seen in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems should be rethought. </seg>
<seg id="397"> “It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report, the different today, as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency to reassess. </seg>

<seg id="625"> Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It also costs money: the legalization of 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US strike fast-food and supermarket-employees </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four american adolescents sits at some point behind the coffers of McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days there was in the United States to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores of popular restaurants and fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow or whether they will soon regain the steam. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests by trade unions and left-wing several non-profit organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers monitor the organizers of the protests which aim to form trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, the sale took place in the United States, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart workers, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which is targeted at low-and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells all products of nappies on Jagdgewehre and batteries to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in Walmart stores-is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Why buy many of the slightly paid Walmart employees-only at their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the Walmart made close to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Critics say the commodity Walmart can often only as good sell, because the staff are paid poorly. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about serious conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants in the protest on “Black Friday” demanding wage increases, and they expressed their anger about the contribution for health insurance betriebseigene from 30 to 100 dollars per month had increased. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart workers, the US dollar 9.5 hour earns, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, show that if the company&apos;s average wage increases to 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost. </seg>
<seg id="741"> That is around 1.1% more than they now pay for donations. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart would complete the wage increases to the customers to pass on any future purchase cost only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Each year, which for them compared to now an additional cost of only 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests, and no losses for the company. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop at 8 p. m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold roughly 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Walmart-coffers on “Black Friday” nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman for the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that overall, “less than five” Walmart workers laid down the work and the protest only “another PR stunt” of the union, organised the protests. </seg>
<seg id="748"> “Free cash!” </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests were this week in New York, where their objective but not-Walmart stores (which in this progressive city not wanted and there are non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and other low-cost restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet it gives you no sick days, and it will not pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York law at $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and gradually increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than they deserve, no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible, in New York, with as little money as possible, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of all american young people after school at McDonald&apos;s, behind the Theke was, however, young people are still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anyone saw in that the main source of income or planned to stay there longer. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I encounter in interviews with staff of McDonald&apos;s always people who complain that they pay with this and sometimes even their children have to feed. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper commentary, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if it did not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protest, which on Thursday at 6.00 a. m. before the McDonald&apos;s in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, began demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They have asked to continue the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits it, corporate governance, this goal to stand in the way of union members and abzumahnen or redundant. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the management of them is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The most important reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> A noisy protest on this day, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The high point of the protests was an assembly of the afternoon before the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including deputy mayors Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald&apos;s says it sell billion pieces, and yet it gives you no sick days, and it will not pay for your honest work!” </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also by other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill de Blasio, who said that “we should share the fast-food workers so that they receive a fair wage and economic prosperity can achieve, which each New York deserves!”. </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, there were only a few hundred local people who, by far, not everyone in the fast-food industry, in the work of tens of thousands in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> “The brain is so far only moderately outsmart” </seg>
<seg id="774"> When supporters of modern technologies loves the enlarged reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Google first showcased in the summer in its annual conference a working model, in November was then known, also a Microsoft patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d technology in Microsoft&apos;s laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a Durchgangsstation. </seg>
<seg id="777"> You are tempted by the opportunity, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate virtual belts. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - You briefly describe what your research group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the humanity in the stage largely stuck in the back with Pixeln at work, sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want to look ahead, 5-10 years and the radical changes of this interaction anticipate. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and the Kinect-Konsole sensors-a step forward, and today will be no more Xbox Kinect sold without, since all interested for movement. </seg>
<seg id="783"> What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Kinect-although the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change, working in a real three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need the Computerwelt in our physical world redundant and intelligible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, it is imperative that not only the user, but also its surroundings will be recognised. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We could then the real world much easier by virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helmets be rid of! </seg>
<seg id="791"> What do you think about Sprachsteuerung? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> And it is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always possible to all others about his actions and intentions would like to inform. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any sort of interaction with computers, but any good in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we were in the area of managing properties in public places in a project for which short and tight, rather than experimenting with sprawling gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not from the Objektkamera, but by a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles were registered. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Still, it is relatively large, could in theory, however, about the size of a wristwatch will be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But overall the future belongs to, for example, however, mixed Steuerungstypen Gestik and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> As this? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - We would like for example I ask you this Sprudeldose too rich? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say it, and at the same time point. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> And this means that they want the user to adjust to what a machine at the relevant time can make and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessarily, but it is a convergence. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that in the near future, particularly in the development of new types of work, which will enable more accurate responses of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This could, for example, be Lasersensoren, as they are in the depths of a good offer, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - Which claims are you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-sensors to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of depth of dissolution, or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The present generation is, in fact, a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, 8 Megapixel with a speed of 1,000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the matrix. </seg>
<seg id="813"> All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Not only must the dissolution of along the X-and Y-but also along the Z-axis are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> And the speed and the number of images per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and to be honest, the current 30 fps especially for little gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond with a Berührungssensor regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1-100 milli-seconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> In my work I needed just such a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more images per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> The number of cameras-should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> Kinect-is currently working with three “cameras”, but one of them is actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third is actually an ordinary RGB camera-camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could solve the problem … </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or the problem as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system in which we could play with various Kameraneigungen in order to find out how, during the investigation of a three-dimensional position helps. </seg>
<seg id="827"> If I remember correctly, in contrast to Google, Microsoft showcased his glasses, not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in the everyday life of the lens of the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> And of course it is not pleasant, always a smart phone in the collected, but I think the following: the tollste formula would be a “rotation” of enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud of the lens to the smart phone could change our tune </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal gadget is its strength and personal matters (only you can see), but also their weakness, because a larger reality through glasses, along with others in virtual objects can work. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Let us, for a moment, that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron, but rest is accessible. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem of this idea critics often point out that there are no visible reaction. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands felt nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers to your group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In my classes, I often talk about the reality of the enlarged seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of taktilen perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure perfectly true. </seg>
<seg id="839"> There are also technologies that actually the images “in the air” something concrete, for example, produces the collision of some Ultraschallstrahlen directed at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that, at the moment, but still so weak, as someone on the pustete Handballen. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bands for the Council on the nerve endings detect in the fingers of influence, which is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Have you tried to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> This way of thinking that it feels, what it should feel when something looks? </seg>
<seg id="843"> That is a good idea, so we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another task to which we still have to struggle, that is, a man who is physically in a closed room is located, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on ideas with Laufbändern (other than in Fitnessstudios), mobile platforms and large bullets. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain only moderately outflank and we still have many years of hard work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This just makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher appeal: on many issues we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> My own taste instead of culture-rosbalt. ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt, the project “Petersburg avant-garde” continues, the city is devoted to the art and culture of the avant-garde. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the select list ended up already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements beyond the borders of the city and the often recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt, the flamboyant artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad Bärtigen the times at the Russian Museum, to Sommergarten, sometimes on-scene meetings or on Vernissagen around them. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Where are the images of Kirill Miller also is issued, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and sent by his presence on the street, its citizens a smile to the face and provides them with good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he grabbed a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for this difficult role in relation to be Künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill-why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the town of travel? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have red as fashion designers, who was elected with the optics and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world of red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society calls on everything that something of the Graunorm differs, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But I want to use my provocations with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Any of my past provocations was an invitation to talk. </seg>
<seg id="863"> When wusstest you, that you must be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> In an exhibition in the Moscow theatre Newskij, in my work were issued. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I have to go down this road. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, to the end, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the “Gazonewschina”; hence, “Puschkinskaja 10”, and then that was just concluded. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It prefers me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And all of the united in your kind-clinic … it was important to me that at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a space in the Puschkinskaja 10 and there was up to the renovation of a musical, artistic club for the Boheme, the home of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: N.O. M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project “Ucho Van Goga” there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> String and his friends sing simple songs to play-back, wearing tight jersey was one of them, and also the composer Igor Wdowin edgy today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> As the group began to play, was broadcast live from their “Leningrad”. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the days of “Halli-Galli.” </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his career, but the foundations he moved with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery 137 “D” or the “club” Griboedov have their origin in-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There, our staff and Stammgäste. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000 there was a poll in the press, where the award “personalities of our city”. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of “artist of the year”, and that it was me on. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy in new times under old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be known without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> Your work-have a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am an exhibition on the theme of “the Russian Museum as a clown”. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier, I was socially, but now it pains and causing fear, to be like this. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blur it all and loses its tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have the bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by requiring everyone to dress up in full. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now respects everyone on the clothes and is based on looks and not at the heart of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not give a person, but should he spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception by Verkleiden disappears. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - a City should, as a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not me? </seg>
<seg id="896"> Commercial art-can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> These days, commercial art-cautious, respectful and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Previously, large groups of people: the Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people of the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am no Einhundert-dollar note that everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you must think about you, whom you&apos;ll have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every Kultstar around 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The appearances by Stas Michailow but several thousand. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And him to be deserted women, is the location of the sexually-social world. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is based. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and what we have achieved, not destroy it. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have such pictures painted by a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images that are normally only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, there are often misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something very different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists on, impoverished and died in poverty and money refused to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Petersburg-Kirill, what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> We say: servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real czar was different, because the tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what the experts might be, but they are barred because it hochrangigerer experts, of the need for the former properly evaluate them and open the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now counts only their own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same is true for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all contemporary art and a number of painters, therefore, other museums must seek. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Petersburg-which is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg-is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a suitable breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones can art is difficult to grow up. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many people who are curious exhibitions or concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In the us are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art needs to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be paid from the city of St Petersburg financed </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with Erdbewohnern on board are seeking a Ersatzplaneten. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity, is a major issue, as we in the zero gravity or the Ersatzplaneten breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are many choices in my opinion, no. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Nämlich “Mars and Venus”, says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> However, while the conditions on mars, there is comparatively enjoyable on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life is only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first with regard to the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already half a century before, experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the in-orbit different varieties of peas, not in the slightest by the earthly species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> What followed was the creation of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 Wachteleier were sent to outer space to explore how the zero gravity on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is developing a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> “The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it needs to be on his legs and can begin to move,” explained the laboratory officials of the Institute for medical and biological problems Ran, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without deep underground, the chicks have been falling in the wild. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and-like. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Four days later they died off. </seg>
<seg id="954"> “We left Zweimal chicks slip, and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible, to work with them,” Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last Brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, on the “same-sex” Biosatelliten Bion only species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized, were sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was anything special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> “That was just the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,” said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the Weltraumratten offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space could have not so far been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals from their natural habitats can simply be taken their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to the man the animals could in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is thinking abstraktem capable and can produce a similar emotional backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk of Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would answer the following question: can it weathers the Weltraumflug? </seg>
<seg id="972"> After this flight, it will bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> “After all, nobody answered that question,” says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after its Weltraumflug, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, was also Andrijan Nikolajew militiamen. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, is the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which twice in orbit was, and even if they work outside the Raumfahrzeugs, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, it remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have extremely few cosmonaut, after long flights in which everything went well and healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> “The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,” concludes militiamen Valery Poliakov quite rightly, hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, the race for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the artificial Erzeugen Gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the cosmonaut is mandatory at the station to perform. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in a state of flux, winning the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the zero gravity. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Although adult water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small Ichtyander witness to that life in the country rose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it was easier to water used. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle this is logical, as from birth until the first swimming just 2 weeks pass. </seg>
<seg id="988"> “This is too little time to forget,” says Marina Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While for a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of zero gravity, the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormous speed back, and thus the ability to extract the baby. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer held to the child of squeezing. </seg>
<seg id="993"> “But what happens then?” is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov quite rightly. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the Erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles do not train. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn baby is in orbit, not as an adult to train in a Belastungsanzug. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance. </seg>
<seg id="998"> “This experiment, which together we make, the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world,” says the head of the Institute for Bioethikkommission medical and biological problems Ran, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space, mere theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, but the reality of it, if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, head of the home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ chief: control of the black-and-system failed by fault of the policy </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good inspection and adequate laws, but in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the conversation for Aktuálně. cz says that the Vice-President of the highest Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> “A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied right-and I think that this is not the case,” kala commented on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar result is apparently a common control by czech and german investigators. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> But a negative Praxisbeispiel leading the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, on the so-called “black” system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would not bite, the system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> “A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is in its work, hinder,” kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a common Czech-german project, in which the laws of both countries in terms of public contracts compared with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What did it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is the result of a parallel investigation with which we have started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is important to ensure that the european legislature to decide how to handle public contracts are to build the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences, generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more “strict and perfect,” the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules we must also address the actual implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? what is for you from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a common control could help that we stop us constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds to try, if it is apparently not particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that the system in this way only with “excessive” paperwork burden on those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, rather than the higher thresholds. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the problems in the practical application of the Czech Vergabegesetzes. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How the system works in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the german equivalent to the NKÚ the General Accounting Office, the similarly structured is like us, and also on a college, which is only slightly different. both authorities, however, similar in principle. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are to a certain extent comparable, with Germany, however, is a federal state, i. e. that it is these courts in individual states-is what distinguishes the german system of our. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The only federal funding BRH cannot control what our government funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in the us from the districts and municipalities are managed there are subject to the control of the let. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the german legislation, it is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I would do this without any concrete data to compare, but Germany is, in some ways, often described as a model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is perhaps because the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Certainly not, but, as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> This is to note that even those countries which, for us, is a model, are also struggling with problems to have. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, is it not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> What the czech legislation, what was important for your authority to review the Vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this novella in force for only a short time, in our tests, it is still not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our checks subsequently take place, it must be here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We feel so far more impact in the phase of future controls – as we have new control “hazard” introduced the inefficiency and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-you will see the changes, of course, because the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of alerts modified and others. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with more red tape? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> However, there is the problem that the rules “strict” and no longer can be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules, a test unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it useful, however, the law is even tougher to make? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system has to exclude those who want to abuse the system and attacking, not penalise those who have committed a mistake on the real decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say, first of all, what is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called “black-and-system” - although what exactly does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the black-and-system now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is, in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: “we change the law and allow the thing,” but he could not say that we act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The Vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to procedural irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied and that is what I think is missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets there is occasionally Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly snow and Eisglätte. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Mostly, however, the streets are used as well, sometimes, increased caution. </seg>

<seg id="1064"> Attention is, however, for example, on bridges, on which the lanes sometimes frozen and smooth. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All routes are also used as the second and third Straßenklasse, including Bergstraßen. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> On these roads, however, section by section vereiste or ausgefahrene Schneereste. </seg>

<seg id="1078"> The roads in the district of Pilsen today are used as well, locally, however, is increased attention, and the driving is to adapt to the weather. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> On the morning of this chilly, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, the end of the world is to take place? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those cries to the people, we are so happy to start up again. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band the Tap Tap make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to the end of the world to stop or prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you also create a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung that we have two years to plan. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> For this, we want to make use of the mayan calendar Marketingpotenzial whose end on 21 December at 11: 10 a. m. forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, i. e. on 20 December, from 21: 00 p. m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts to be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a time zone for 12 hours before us, the mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> This idea comes from whom? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> We would like to not only sufficient positive energy, the end of the world, but also with the public to think about the state of this world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with a purchase on www. e-tap. cz people also can support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band the Tap Tap has joined with other performers also known as the anthem for the end of the world with the title “Weltuntergang comes from”. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Already today, the anthem on YouTube in. it is also the Benefizkonzerten ring out? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, and in the end, provided that all work and the end of the world is not taking place … </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem should by all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns together in a Direktschaltung by Czech Television broadcast live. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, also plays Xindl X sings with … </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How are you working with both? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech Kulturszene associated with that, that we have many Benefizveranstaltungen concerts and realize … </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try to these people hard in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that most interest in working with us, and to have fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What is the purpose of the proceeds benefit concerts for the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the seamless Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we are already six years together with the club in the Tap Jedlička Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students are regularly Jedlička Institute of teachers who cared for them in different leisure activities help. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the pupils themselves do not have the resources to do the teachers go, we would like to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the completion of the Jedlička Institute to a separate buildings, in which we then with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert, several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What criteria do you have these selected? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted a programme together, all the generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, enter Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta, with Dan, the Tap, Tap Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else you hear on the website www. kpks. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar “events” are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time of the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we had been in the United States would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your Auslandspläne are not just small, yet you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How you deal with these visits logistical and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it appears at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i. e. the wheelchairs must be transported in Gepäckraum. we must also, of course, many other mitschleppen Instrumentenkoffer and luggage … </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes already part was surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison, as in the various countries with accessibility is, how they deal with disabled people, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East, everything still in its early days. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Moscow, Prague is absolutely not accessible. there it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair user, for example, in the lift vorlässt. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately there are also clubs that try to address the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we have to tell the more developed countries catch up? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things on which we depend on later … </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of the people affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities self-employed in the public space, into a museum, toilets can use, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not usual that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, we are in with the band the Tap Tap slightly ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and removal is one thing, but only when our ranks from major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far there have been only isolated cases of particularly willensstarken personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a couple of years: what have you in 1998, motivated to start a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> At the time I began as carers in Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in with something very hard to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am and musicians including Saxofon plays, I, together with a colleague a music company was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and with time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, say, a little out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band became known, but only in the last few years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped; in addition, we have begun to actively for us to promote. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We are aware that, if one does something and it does not see the merit in some sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to EU aid, we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was your objective, with the Tap Tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I have the potential, I felt that things in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The branch is now often copied one of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> That is, in his way, logical, because everything is new, taken with caution and take longer to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the spectators usually has, of course, compassion, of course; this is just … </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, as long as they have the funds to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities, some manage to do it not just for themselves is a step forward, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, how many people listening? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, we must not compromise on many things, and also has a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think this is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic notions, and if they see that they have tested twice a week, stages of preparation to study and spend a lot of time on, sponsoring concert tours, then extinguished the enthusiasm among many quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> So it works but everywhere, in every band who work hard and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the Tap Tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the beginning, i. e. since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group: people come and go: this cannot be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and the desire to by “coming on board”, we always welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was at a meeting with him of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth member of this space. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA member). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994 of close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several ESA projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, the Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with space, so that it is not always met on understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I refer, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author of ideas from his pioneering “entrance to Kosmonautik presented.” </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (another 1905.) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of recalled Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won the 1934 “year for entrance to the Kosmonautik” by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André delivered Prix RDP-Louis Hirsch Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was by acknowledged that one of the crater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon has been named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Earlier in the year was 1925 in Poland to a railway-building, for which a Draisine Raketenantrieb was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the proposal and the details of this project is unfortunately remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket or the brakes are activated the Draisine should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The data come exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, began the polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen shells. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the documents that the research stage to the practical test was developed. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research was then, but by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, appeared in the press by Ing. Rohoziński originating fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete on draft, and the following year was the work of “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy) - coordinated. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work was his work, however, by the war ended. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other articles on space travel appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society is in the 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy magazine, in which four long articles are devoted to space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a Raumfahrtgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At its inception in 1956 to the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the 1951 founded International Federation for space and, in fact, the PTA is already in the fall of 1956 ordinary member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first chairman of the PTA-Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this role he had, until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 played the PTA was instrumental in the development of the very successful missile (meteorological Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start came on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 feet long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1a, built in 1959 and began in the desert with the Błędów-Flugtests Zweistufenrakete RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further development should already be capable of real scientific work to make the missile-RM-34 to an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of Höhenwinden are in use. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, was the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The first rocket-type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their overall length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Of these, three types of missile developed (Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1c states), which are the size of Transportraums for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1a missile had a transport with 0.4 5 litres, Meteor-1b on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1c states on 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude in all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years in 1965 to 1968 Luftfahrtinstitut the Meteor-2 rocket, developed the first Flugtests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a Nutzlast 10 kg in a level of around 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Since then, the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth of Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national committee COSPAR followed. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the programme also Interkosmos in space research with soviet satellites, and in 1978, the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has called on the public to a lively discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting that the issue from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world, was based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the end, this means that the individual economies in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is due to the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital, complete with rampant speculation go hand-in-hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (salaries) are Preisspannungen. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> This term is a condition to understand, in which the manufacturers tried to import cheap goods by economic competition, by the competition of “undercutting”, in order to create more of a market share grab and its profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The large-scale means that for most companies, their production abroad to relocate or buy cheaply, or their business, the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As the private sector no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for that it caused unemployment to increase the spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and they caused by the wider economic and social damage to replace. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics here are superfluous. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practices of the private sector creates a situation in the individual economies, where governments are forced to compete with each other to make the social standards of its own population to artificially lower and thus to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This manifests itself in particular changes in existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to its own people and to force the dictates of the private sector, in particular in terms of accepting. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is done by financial constraints with long-term unemployment, on the other, by reducing workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany there has, for a number of years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people affected is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of german economy, it regularly to cases in which employees received such a poor reward for the state to increase their income subsistence needs. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employed workers discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures, virtually all the EU&apos;s southern states will, no doubt, in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and to hope that, at some point, private capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here is, by its very nature, the question of where this capital is coming? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it is from another EU country, only the poverty is moving from one country to another; or the capital remains the same from, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the salaries. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies across Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital in its own economy involved, and that planning for economic calamity. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private sector will narrow insists on its position that the state not to intervene directly in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then we have to ask if the private sector the policy and therefore the whole state in their own selfish sense influenced or even draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and all-pervasive in all states lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual benefit, the legislation, in the virtually everything, but nothing is criminally punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the reality is that a lack of finances private Staatsministerium crowded, with the industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the drafting of legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These are then adopted draft legislation in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The violence is not from the people, as western constitutions, but by large financial groups, which have their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic and Pompey Caesar” describes: “the state has long been the break-up, and the offices were filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already bought votes in the election…” “people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul” … “we started really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this grave situation an autocracy is a strong man, and that should be chosen” … Appian thought it at Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is based in today&apos;s society as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference to its own advantage, without societal interests into account. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private sector is by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognise and enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, then as now, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must, therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> The current condition, can the demise of this regime in favour of liberal democracies, are regarded as some break in the next round is already taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we have from the older and newer history know, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on a not-for-profit work here is not a solution, or at least no lasting. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of the global and european economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to make social level of population down. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore bound. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital of the state of the economy, increase citizens&apos; influence on the government and the private sector monopoly position in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> “… Nothing from violence occurs, or ever could be,” sings the song Fragile Sting, the key verse, the refrain is: “… so that we do not forget how fragile we are.” </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “When my sons wanted no wars, no,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the year 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> The one behind argue with Israel and its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the state of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point I would not write about who in these endless waves of killing anyone who is guilty and victims; in the end, today&apos;s residents of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence have not even seen. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is that the readers to look behind the scenes to open the mind, of whom 95 years tension (from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) spots in the small country in the Middle East, in particular, are fit. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of it, who or what group of people, the events of modern history strongly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is, first and foremost, a history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era we can Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether there really are these people themselves were the autonomous certain steps, or whether someone was behind their throne, their actions to a goal vorbestimmtes relented. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomical stabs a particularly rich families, as the head of the octopus called (I do not know if someone is still on them, I add this) - but not from the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) was from the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, bought the link of your name with hochkriminellen deeds, whose background is in the consolidation of its power, the increase in their wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are nearly all the central banks in the world, and to the countries in which they do not attend the central banks are involved, they lead wars or fitted to these (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall of Ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia its Central Bank, in the meantime, the russian government has implied). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank to renew started during the civil war of their own (read: state) notes and 1865, was murdered in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; members of the Louis McDonald Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression wanted to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite of the Rothschilds resulted in the years 1859-1871 to formulating a plan to unleashing of three wars by Albert Pik, freemasons and the 33rd highest degree of insight. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aim was the big royalist Staatenwesen Europe to remove the second war in particular should be broken Britain&apos;s colonial rule, and the third war, the world&apos;s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would be for their comforts and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a Universalreligion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up), and finally to the assumption of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is working that triggers a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao-order from chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are wrong and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, to crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered not repeat). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo had managed the first World War, they destroyed the russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the tsarist Russia, the war was no longer necessary), then came the dissolution of the central european superpower, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> World War II easier to ignite, the bankers by the policies of a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic documented war reparations; they created by the condition of impoverished masses, so that the Germans only a sufficiently strong leaders had to keep palming, named the guilty and simple solutions offered; another factor has been the creation of a multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, the function of a fifth column should take and also took the Kriegsbrand. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, which is a branch of the creation of a Judenstaates wanted to see as much as possible to the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as the capital of (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of jews to Palestine; there has been first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There have been terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain broke on the international bankers initially believed, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, created the suffering of the european jews in concentration camps, the condition for the recognition of the jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, as well as by the war reparations Germany against the soil for the Second World War, with the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers, will succeed in this war is to unleash the jewish people as in the Second World War to the victims in the front Kampflinie, this time with the arab or muslim people of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only of how strongly people in Israel&apos;s supporters and opponents divide). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israeliten, where it is wrong in a never-ending cycle of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It should be between the peoples of Israel and its leaders differ, but the international bankers in Israel, just as we, the people, only its own candidate for the election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal dutiful politician is doing everything to ensure that a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), quickly becoming a global conflict could extend, and it is because of the control of Iran&apos;s only 2 miles wide on the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world&apos;s oil supplies pass, to destroy the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In which light because the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: “the only thing we need is an all-wide crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.” </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten serves. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted this nature of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> “And it makes that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the open air and the servants of all is a Malzeichen give to their right hand, or in their face, that no one can buy or sell, because he had the Malzeichen: the name of the animal, or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, anyone who has the intelligence, considering the number of the animal. </seg>

<seg id="1338"> For the american government there was no good way out of this situation-they could not afford, the Shah to cast aside, as this is the confidence of their allies in other countries have been heavily damaged. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, she was not in a position, in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were finally captured after 444 days released after negotiations mediated by the algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&apos;s defeat in the presidential election against Ronald Reagan in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, directed by Ben Affleck and actor describes an episode in the history of the United States, a small partial victory. </seg>

<seg id="1346"> This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA managed in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant Verdeckung story to its true identity-they travelled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly in the country Drehorte for a science-fiction movie. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The experts on “Exfiltration”, Tony Mendez, developed the plan also made Hollywood&apos;s cooperation is needed. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The cover was credible, article on this film in journals, press conferences have been held and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were long kept secret; the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called “Caper Movie,” i. e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks as, for example, the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the film the Stimmungsebenen-on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen (from Tehran in the Titelsequenz ikonische contemporary photographs to be shown, and also in the same Filmfassung situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other side of the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily taken to its extreme. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA and other key institutions-men in suits on Besprechungstisch, Amtsfluren, on the phone … </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck with this remarkable film is a relaunch of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a belächelten actor is a director of respectable, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third movie after the whodunit not easy Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film Afflecks, not in their local Boston plays the film-maker. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films by the director of the standard Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada “played”. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place-the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity and gives it very impressive, yet the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, their history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect, Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to face up to the fact that history is not, in fact, many in the cinematographic sense exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> With the little but he works quite well, with the reality he sometimes nachhilft-then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, something curious). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is its all too broad distribution, which is caused by the need to act, too much in too many places to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, their characters but would have more space, and in the film, they are far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film by losing traction. it is a movie, the one with some interest, and the design and the to a thriller from the 70 years-like style goutieren angle. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a date in some way of living history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for inflating balloons of banana, and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The site www. bankovnipoplatky. com, an annual survey of the most preposterous charges, has declared this year decided that the competition “most absurd regulation or idea from the EU&apos;s workshop”. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> “On this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large european companies to introduce,” said Patrik Nacher, who was responsible for the organisation of this survey, with the newspaper Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated aberrations we see, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on unifying the Versicherungstarife for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less of a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> “Other incredible incursions from the EU&apos;s workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” said Nacher with. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blend of bio-ethanol fuels in its wake naturschädigend is that of the ban on the reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes contain, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive. </seg>

<seg id="1383"> The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels during the rule of one or more member states are represented (as the Czech Republic is trying, for example, currently with veto threat by the demands of czech banks impose). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also discovered that the highest Handelsklasse bananas in the EU at least 14 centimeters long and must be “no Krümmungsanomalie”. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission argued that with the argument that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU against the resistance of some countries already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, in accordance with the balloons in the sale must be equipped with the suggestion that children under eight years Luftballon without the supervision of an adult aufblasen. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU, citing an american study, according to the leading cause of balloons in the suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar reduction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also funny ideas at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd is also a directive, which european officials themselves-so everyone in the EU&apos;s official social function, because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece will not use the name of Macedonia and instead must FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominee in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the aforementioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU, so that the Höchstvolumen in food stocks, which is on the day of our membership of the EU in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set Pilzkonserven volume for us, and a large fine threatened. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea of grants for applications for grant money. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> “We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We are in the EU to apply for reimbursement,” declared in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp following the so-called Interventionseinkäufe were overcrowded. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> As a further way to seaports in the Czech Republic, the EU should Palas according to hundreds of millions of euros of us pay. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far in that it is an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain from organised countries who do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Grants for requests for funding for the communities of the Department of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, if it is the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Eu: bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations in the Member States are easy targets of criticism that the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A deeper problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of european integration have in common, but when the budget negotiations were forced by individual member states. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions here, also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name “Olomoucké tvarůžky” to defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský Rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, had our manufacturers, however, in “Tuzemák rename.” </seg>

<seg id="1411"> “People want me to do the Republic himself, but I am just an amateur,” Okamura said. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, as it comes to the idea for the President to stand? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not my intention, senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If, in our country, all without problems would work, I would get nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see the Republic for 20 years, as thieves plundered will walk free, while the people&apos;s taxes and the retirement age be increased. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But if I see something that I do not like it, I try to propose a solution to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was about 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no other option than to influence things, for senator or the president to stand. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, have you been able to and then straight on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> You do your constituents the back? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that I fight for the castle after the result of the elections will be. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have this clarified and said that I was a candidate for the office of President of will, if I am elected a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function of the role is an instrument with which I can do my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> To that end I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and the television grumble, but anyone who raises, wants to change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Come to the media, the honour of abducting a wish, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me, for example, it was claimed that journalists bribed or that I would I advisor Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The battle over the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of political leaders as well as retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have in this respect not only skills, and the Senate as a whole will bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen I have worked to ensure that the business remains a free tour guide, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal, this deliberately refused, and the population is on. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent Parteiloser I have a much greater potential to support from all political parties represented in parliament to win. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I and without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen from every party that can take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> See you as a person in politics rather than on the left or the right? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the czech point of view, it seems to me that people can see more of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this left-right thinking but totally unimportant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What is important to me is that we can make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care whether or not someone to the left or to the right; I want people associate. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support publicly any good solution, even if these KSČM or from the ODS is too, and I am against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It does not like you, if someone they described as a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you will not confirm what you just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you will have a Idealziel and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And this, you wish to approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> This can be as far as populism, but all proposals, which I have spoken to function in the world already, or they have been key experts discussed. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament, you just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And so that you come in the politics in the long run is not far. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that you, if you only long enough to talk to the people who will be able to, for example, the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, to secure these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As President would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to the statute book. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they may reject it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, to the abuses, can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> If you take only once the direct election of the president, which is a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to allies for my views and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the policy I have only just started and I try my programme, for the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to go to judge; and if it does not work, then I am in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> That sounds a little, as if the Czech Republic should save Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I can do nothing alone; I have with several well-known figures discussed whether it does not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have, for example, with Radim Jančura spoke, however, as a result of excessive workloads rejected. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of voters are not at all to the elections, and those who have gone to have mostly elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we have only two independents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have such a Senatszusammensetzung elected that changes will be very difficult to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about setting up a separate party after? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not even thought about that, because I do not have much time, the past every potential Parteimitglieds to review, and that it does not have the money for it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not even money for the transparent Präsidentenkampagne; on my account, only 20,000 czk. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I value my personal wealth of around 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a home for about 10 million, another 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million, as well as an Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and I also have a couple of million in the bank. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Ashton Martin was, in fact, a Kindertraum-James Bond has always appealed to me in the car drove galant to women, and at the same time against the evil battle. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> They drive a Ashton Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is probably not too much attention. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign is, basically, my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the Senatorengehalt alone, I could not live; I could, for example, my son, not the english school funding, the cost of 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Will you stay so further work as entrepreneurs, if your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you did not cut back on these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that is not linked to the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have my activities partially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy in the spring, CEO of the travel agents. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want to see me as the good samaritans of the Republic saves. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must have something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> In the monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Around 200,000 to 400,000, and it continues to be so. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I believe, to stop operations. </seg>

<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby corporate sector, says: “but it is nice to have the house.” </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder, what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is yet in one of these Old-Style-libraries, or? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, the record holder is outlandish. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80,000 residents, community education rates, the lowest of the whole of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to counteract this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven fictional bridges on the refusing, as nicely bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen depicted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the training was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the Stadtväter realized that there was only one possibility, Mr statistics: a library, ago. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen cynical, and often works, took up the cause with his usual equanimity and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books, the rich and a grin on your face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury still intrigued to eyes and wave our hands zuckte stapelte impudent Maas, of his distinguished Mitbringsel in size to a pyramid and ended aktionistisch underpinned his speech with the words: “love Stadtgemeinde!” </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive aufgeschüttet Berg. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a couple of adjacent residential and Reihenhäuser with a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second best price “Library of NL 2012”. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 nominated. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> So that is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte, which until now have not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly behind City Hall, whose white walls, would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, for a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to books </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is admittedly a lift, in the middle of the massif leads, but the real area-and tap the Lesefreuden fußläufigen climbing the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and clear, the shy Klinkerboden and the elegant Straßenlaternen unambiguously speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> People are already looking for Parkbank, dog and played football and boys Mädels. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere, books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> “Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, shady areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal,” says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and inside out of the Lesebereich enclosing. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: in the middle, library, offices, Internet, and Haustechnikzentrale Schachclub environment centre. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular pleasure is the black bookshelves, which, sometimes, sometimes Wandverkleidung Brüstung Stiegengeländer. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Haptik optics, and smell are alien. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and whether the unknown Baustoffs Engineers shake their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> “We wanted to be here with recycling materials work,” said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen holding one day for a fitting waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies than Wurzelunterlage. </seg>

<seg id="1539"> For the library, the fleece-for the first time in these amounts to four-inch thick plates are squeezed. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under pressure and Hitzeeinwirkung discolour the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl after new cars and a bissl after Sportschuh smell. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 stages is at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 metres will migrate in Literaturcafé with not only a fantastic prospect in the city, but also with dutch Kroketten eingetopften Ficusbäumen and rewarded. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit in Literaturgebirge. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> “You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems, the sun even on sunny days only briefly interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad Holzleimbinder, across to outside glass of face, serve as such as shadowing and catch a large part of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The Raumklima is very pleasant. </seg>

<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, has dared to go the way of the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, Boekenberg even as a long-overdue Spijkenisses “soul”. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone residents invited to a book from his personal stock to donate. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> That is for another day the optical gaps in the still not fully-stocked library-currently 70,000 piece-are filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is good enough. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up their back teeth. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> “Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> “I think, thanks to our invitation, each now residents of a certain relationship with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> If only to grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> It is those MVRDV Königsdisziplin managed, in the jargon identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: “Germans have greater role” </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain from the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on us-european relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations would vote in favour. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then abstained from Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why is that? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it is not of the american position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was, after all, the NATO force. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on this issue? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it&apos;s true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it is his foreign policy and shifting away from a policy, as it were, from the US gemanaged was, to a german foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are so between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> We expect them to play an independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they abuse are still on their role, but they are on the path to a more “normal” foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What is a “normal” foreign policy, what specifically from a german point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the US or european partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the german foreign policy from the economic policy is motivated, so exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are, to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> They have economic interests influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why it must be careful to the public, but also the elite in the arab countries not to offend the. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is definitely a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would also not want too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is definitely an important role in german thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the US, taking on major decisions abstained from the vote, for example, in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think, in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the german position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> But because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions to the palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States have been clear for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences of opinion between the US and many european nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of the american domestic politics these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly pretty much sympathy for the european position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, are not represented. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not so great, as they always seem to. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, this is not so, Obama, possibly by Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified european policy, which is not the case at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can&apos;t be part of a broader approach and instead must things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That they do, just with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe, a european position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they are a more independent role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play an active role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the lead Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not yet accustomed, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country remains difficult, a greater role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, as will each time Germany a greater role, various anti-german feelings freely. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It is not simply the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in european policy, the EU steadily filling the vacuum at the moment but not who remains otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply need to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like, it is not nice and it is much less popular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>

<seg id="1631"> “Brand protection” in China: if China is suddenly an Armani and Puma </seg>
<seg id="1632"> An Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is an Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this lies a in China are officially registered name, but they are not about the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it enjoys protection so long as the real Lord who brought us not suing. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether it was right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> “It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners, to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the Chancellery Taylor Wessing on Schutzrechtsverletzungen specialises in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The rich imitators have a couple of additional letters, so they must register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So will simply Lu-from Gucci Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny register. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also in this way, legally copied around the sports goods manufacturers Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens up a raft of registration with the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a chinese company&apos;s trademark Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The chinese world champion in copying and violating intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are almost exclusively mehrstöckige department stores, which sell counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his client, it is the fact that chinese companies by the Patent Office as officially given the right to use the name, already elsewhere is protected. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The chinese call this “Bang,” a Mingpai Beifahrermarke. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on “Bang Dakuan.” </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So are women, rich men angling. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> “It will be bad for business, we have to combat it,” urges Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> “The brand is being watered down, the Alleinstellung disappears, the damage is enormous.” </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and higher litigation costs of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year&apos;s third largest market for luxury goods, and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But erased entries in the dubious Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because after a long objected to the name “reality”. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because its brand in China, says Pattloch injured. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases concern also graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that company, which recently took over the german Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must therefore until now an emblem of using the Mercedes-star resembles. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo, Geely buyers originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The Lacoste Modehersteller lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction to look. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Patent Office CTMO in Beijing, while that of 2010 due to lower personnel and Raumausstattung bottlenecks. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year was one of the “emergency situation in business returned to normal life.” </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57 000 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Yet waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Address it costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and means that China and for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen throughout the world, shares with the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This also applies to the existence of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Simply, this means that any application in an average of 160 1280 yen or euro costs. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Address it costing many times, as the case of the german family firm Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years of fighting, the company against a chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> It is true that the Germans that the illegal manufacture of imitation Kraftfahrzeugteile unearthed. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But secured the imitators continue to the chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We even have failed in this, as in Germany, not family name could be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Patent Office CTMO rejected the objection to the Munich as well. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies, Freudenberg may be right, but the fighting Prozessgegner until further today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You have to watch your step </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The matter is now before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: “the process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and stress.” </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even a hundred years old files they need, in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a “high six-figure Eurobetrag”. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> “This shows how much it is worth to us,” says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East to Europe even threaten zurückzuschwappen. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> That is, if there are imitators vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> It is a chinese manufacturers in Germany, the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This area of business the company anymore, yet he has the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> “You have to watch your step,” says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise german companies when dealing with China is to be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners “everything that is worth protecting, also known in China,” as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg Markendramas is governed by its last act, then we should do the other side pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be in the segment in question out of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Aids Day: Stampfen, sing, help </seg>

<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means to ethnic Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The Bantusprache can speak fluent in this area, but no one sings. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this soft foreign language and brings them from time to go back to where they originally came from: in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Since 8 733 miles as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, the voting power of the german part depends. </seg>

<seg id="1732"> Leaving school without qualifications, in a poor country, certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still the commitment of private individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and a warm meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later founded the chorus of the club, “voices for Africa”, which has since almost professionally for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni cares. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI, HIV, Herpes, humane Pappilomaviren genitalis or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Filzläuse Krätze and belong to the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four of five all in Germany reported syphilis cases through sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually-transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults over here is comparatively small, however: around 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people enter chlamydia infections far more frequent than in other communities. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to european surveys cover three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Come over here and humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections developed? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch-Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections is since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were around 700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is around a tenth of less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms point to Geschlechtskrankheit? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, complaints to the Urinieren, outflows, as well as Unterbauchschmerzen Bläschen Warzen or cause. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can we protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> As part of the pathogen can sexually transmitted diseases by Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> So experts recommend particularly in changes frequently Sexpartnern regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Early diagnosis can most curable STI and after-effects will be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> By twinning, donations and, not least, the quite the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, up to a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> “In total, we have about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni sent,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village of self-managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman, the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It is also concerned about the orphans of good store, at one of the grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos and how the old women on ethnic Zulu cites are the mainstays of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans to be included, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms on time every day to the learning. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Anyone who has come into Schutzhaus to Khanyisile, a lone woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks every day for more than 200 hungry children cook. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, “voices for Africa” a Nähschule launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American Health Organisation PSI organised that many in the village have an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not to be taken for granted, because obviously the disease across the country, it also is silent, they prefer dead. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> “AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.” </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch, King Mswati III of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also state-sanctioned due to this way of life that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms there at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but are rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different-flesh to flesh.” </seg>
<seg id="1780"> For cultural exchange to promote something travels the Imbongi-chorus every two to three years, together with the South Africa and singing songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and self-assurance that many black on black southern bit of the continent from the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white, the songs in a black language sing-as much recognition not only of mood and pleasure, but it has also had some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip is leading after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even though the small village on maps, little place in the valley of the River Ezulweni-it is more than aware of. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> “Going after Esitjeni, there is the light,” say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And if the 8733 miles as the crow flies in Heidelberg, returns to the stampfenden singers in the street in the Proberaum Bergheimer, then this will shine. </seg>

<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insight they provide deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the Hale telescope-in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego Fernrohr, the biggest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres. </seg>

<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save money. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel ground-and in his limited mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is in Höhenwinkel fixated. </seg>

<seg id="2024"> He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But the fact is, indeed, expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often in the press, and most people seem not to care. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here you still hate it, Anders Breivik to name those racist, right-wing extremists, which last year 77 men, women and children shot. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it refers only to the “incident on 22 July.” </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians, find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main responsibility for today&apos;s wealth is in Norway since the early 1970&apos;s, the growth of one of the biggest oil-and-Gasindustrien the world. </seg>

<seg id="2035"> Norway, with its oil wealth is very careful handling, a large part of the Branchenerträge will be for the benefit of future generations in a special fund invested. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As in the years leading up to the Great Depression, all the money is raised, they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> “As long as we go skiing in the winter and in the summer, are able to go, we are very happy,” says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> “And of course Rakfisk eat,” she adds with unbeschwertem laughter. </seg>

<seg id="2046"> “Here are our points Havard.” </seg>

<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, Will Grant analysis prepared by the BBC which he challenges and the mixed emotions of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently, the movement in Mexico City is particularly bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, it is always a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, built several key routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads is causing havoc. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but protesters to prevent the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon&apos;s Mexico has been economically well able to prove, but the country is in the grip of a drug war which, in the last six years already 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> “My government is strongly committed to the violence,” Pena Nieto said at the beginning of this week, in the Oval Office of the US President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he was with the US President on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor than his Heimatstaats Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this sprawling, densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, like to him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Inhabitants of the Urlaubsorts write him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Around the city, can be found on one of the highways, Pena Nieto has left the building and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> With his name badges also depend on outside of a modern Sportzentrums an impressive and interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> “We expect it to real and lasting change,” as his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Party Pena Nietos, the PRI is working. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, regarding the safety and economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The accusations from the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is a man very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, but he is also someone who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military was called in to the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a corner of fallow land near a large garbage dump, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women left behind. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women are murdered-a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez than for their violence and the killing of innocent women is notorious. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the view that the problem of the murders of women during his time in office, at least not properly addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But in the worst case, his government had their eyes closed. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a Betonbau, typical of the rundown neighborhoods, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna for whom she shows. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of the events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> “When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies washed,” remembers Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already used. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While their mother told her story, looks up from the wall a picture of Mariana on us down. it is in addition to a cross, a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family has until now denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> You want to just accept their verdict and mouths. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> “But this is not possible when there are so many errors and omissions,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of mexican families were in the last six years of violent crimes affected, and the new president has promised during his tenure, especially in order to take care of this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> “I hope that, as President, he is so as governor, as he was,” says the PRI congressmen Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> Mexico-my american identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people were due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to the emigrants to accuse-they are calling them hard times into memory, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was in the passport arrived than bewilderment in me wide. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues, one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), the other for “Extranjeros” (“foreigners”). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to me to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up all my life and was “Mexicans”. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic-acronym, just as my friends in Boston “irish” or my friends in New York “Italians.” </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I opted for “Mexico-american.” </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this one was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather&apos;s, there was no need for acronyms or put. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak spanish well enough, at least, to me in this language at both ends to an interview to claim. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my american accent, I will also do not go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my american passport, and found myself in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were all those subjects you expected if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the mexican economy, which it is one reason that Mexicans today with equally likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to be with the United States and Canada side and a north american trading bloc modeled on the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico&apos;s war against the drug cartels to continue, although he gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never wasting a single to the United States in 1848, in Mexico, the country&apos;s leadership under vorgehaltenem gun, forced them to more than half its territory to leave. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event is not to be overlooked. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a US Treasury official also only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the mexican press and among the elite of the country-complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children Montezumas sink on the war-path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, the greatest challenge in Mexico&apos;s truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Interested resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers, people, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of mexican descent in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of a person, perhaps a parent or Großelternteil-no chance in Mexico to shy and immigrated to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person was a profile-brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of the people, and our allegiance to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may now have to live the american dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the american dream is that we live-not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is blurred, sometimes, perhaps, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many members of Mexico&apos;s ruling class do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we do not have enough Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In your opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families in Mexico had failed, they would not have gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not now see Seidenvorhang caught-behind with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States einwanderte, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican-Americans take them so badly. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While US citizen, has seen itself as a part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the mexican band los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we as Americans saw it. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I would learn during my trip, is there anything that this relationship is more complicated: some parts of the mexican leaders and their links to the diaspora Bildungsbürgertums would resume. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> You want to mexican Americans as a provisional “ambassador” for Mexico, their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should have our american colleagues, telling them how great a visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership, their ties to Mexico to step up. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many wounded feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid there you need alone, cronies. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some mexican Americans harbour a grudge for how their family members until not so long ago were treated. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are “mexican” than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be a windfall for the cornerstone of peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed-and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while Israelis and Palestinians in their historic conflict seem to be caught, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither will be won or lost </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, optimism, given the current situation inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week&apos;s fighting Hartgesottenen on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group itself has seen major losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders were killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip, in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel, yet managed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, the Hamas in the West Bank, which Fatah&apos;s rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe is controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> So, as islamists in the arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power wiedererstarkende, once known as Israel&apos;s closest muslim ally has for Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an islamic crescent-from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren-style before the Stürzung Bashar Assad&apos;s regime could, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, far and away the most important arab einwohnerstärksten and land on the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, Egypt&apos;s secular despot, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders verschwägert Volksansichten more dependent. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States are not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, suggest an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s “Iron Dome” missile defense system, has been able to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel is sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States steadfast in its position, many european countries have Hamas for the latest escalation. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remained, not least thanks to the security wall in the West Bank, and thus in the body of an eventual palestinian state hineinverlaufen. protect the jewish settlements, which are illegal under international law for have been declared, but always be developed further. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party in the run-up to the election on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren allied group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this nanny hinterlistigen Palestinians and give them a state of their own devices? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they are really controlling the West Bank, would it not just as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also fire missiles? </seg>

<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will look first to the difficulties in their own country. </seg>

<seg id="2250"> For the near future, the small-hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now get together with Turkey and Qatar the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before to Hamas to the idea of a jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince. </seg>

<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest Raucherquoten in the world and the changes only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco companies fought hard against the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It was said, with the laws, the black-market trade favours what to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> “The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of british American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and indonesian counterfeiters are far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws of their business have been encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis Silikondeckeln and to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the corporations, british American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the australian legislation failed. </seg>

<seg id="2280"> “If tobacco is marketed and only a small area has its products to apply to the Internet is not around,” says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman, an increase of Erfahrungsberichten to brands, noted the “ordinary people”. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question must be asked: is this just a private person, so the great service of Marlboro cigarettes, that even includes a video-or has a marketing agency to do? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing to focus, with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> She has even gone so far as to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay the new rules-to challenge those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries to consider similar Verpackungsgesetze. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was in 2001 was the first country to photographic warnings required. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>

<seg id="2290"> Many australian smokers are defiantly. </seg>

<seg id="2298"> In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, unexpectedly, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course Tax-free shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more graduates and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, whatever the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us these days almost permanently on the other screen or a rigid, brings the benefits of boredom, not more. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I will come back once again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increased leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of “Boredom: a Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011), sees it that way. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> “In fact, the boredom has a very long history,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The Hauswände Pompejis signs a latin inscriptions on boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long, reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of around 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, “a satisfactory job, but it does not want to be able to define.” </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not employed, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The Schlüsselerfahrung boredom, he says, is to “disrupt Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and feel that time passes slowly.” </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can almost hear such as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people the problem in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that us is dull, even if we only have problems, we have to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In its study, “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention” in German, for example: “the inert minds: the definition of boredom in the light of the attention in September in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listening to a band, in which a person a Magazinartikel read. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television channel from neighbouring areas, which has nothing to do with the content had heard it on other low-volume, so it was almost invisible, while the third group was not hear these noises. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who are barely recognisable television echoes surveyed, more boring than the other two groups, to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote of their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to take on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> However, if you have a dreary work - “like the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored.” </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people who physically can fight to remain alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> “Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln should learn more and more information than those who keep the Stillsitzen be forced,” Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us at some point my boring-delayed flight, a loudspeaker dröhnender, a particularly tedious film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> These differences in order to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980&apos;s, a “scale of Langeweileanfälligkeit.” </seg>
<seg id="2334"> At the bottom there are statements such as “many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonously” and “I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything.” </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scale, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida-particularly on the need for more and more diverse external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991 led Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents for seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework Erledigen were bored, while 23% said that seem to be, if they are not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of the parents surveyed, bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He was sure, however, that “the youth is regarded as a particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers do not have a big influence on their Alltagsablauf. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my Ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> In the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads to extreme physical people to take risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate, studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Vodanovich, this view is Professor of the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> “With the boredom to the brain of a saying that we should do something different,” Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is best to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is dull and the energy used to Gitarre to play and cook will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can do in the short term to ensure that these Glücksgefühle verflüchtigen long term but again. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, a child who his gelangweilten iPad is enough, it can distract from the boredom; it has not learned to run or to control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: “self-regulation spreads from one situation to the other.” </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child is learning not just to entertain but also receives more self-control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not to be critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our goal should be to us outside of the permanent Aktivitäts Technologieberieselung and at ease. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> “It sounds as if we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that people have in fact, look for a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> “In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert will find it hard to look at when the noise has fallen silent again.” </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidance on the new Marihuanagesetz </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco was that he and some friends on a Septembertag drive in Lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco had been in the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien summoned-Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 and have received a court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> “We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is he? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, to legalise the answer depends in hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes by the law, as the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, have already dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession of small-scale, which is legally permitted once the new legislation in the coming weeks to enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing Marihuanadelikte quote and people are still on trial. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in a number of cities, suburbs of the Denvers until the Western Mountains on new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte attended the opening of their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> “This situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of the theater in Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a road map for establishing a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug-and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado, in every case, most states is ahead of what the regulation of marijuana is where the drug only for medical purposes and then Eigenkonsum legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> “Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide,” says Brian D. Smith, the spokesman for the Insurance spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith is also on the ground or that no system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> “We have no real precedent that we can follow,” he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this time around, such as the imposition of a state of “fair access” to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare centres should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> “Nowhere is it more difficult to be a location for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “Center for Legal cannabis,” a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November Chief Oates sent his staff theater in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said the prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, no longer, and that the police had “immediately” no prosecutions for such offences will strive for. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to prevail. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck a harsher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences have been indicted. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> “Our agency has the duty to monitor violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt crime was,” Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions themselves are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the Landkreises shows for the possession of small quantities of adults no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> “I do not think that I waste my time in order to enforce the law until it is changed,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the beginning that this would not be a simple matter, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the conflicting reactions throughout the state that encouraged local officials under a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> In Bezirksstaatsanwälten was an “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for the defendants Marihuanadelikte in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization to reform Marihuanagesetzen operates. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> “You have such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for the legalisation, that they still cannot accept,” he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol will deal with Colorado and Washington as a national test-cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue to treat as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The Legalisierungsbewegung advocates hope that the Justice Ministry to give in. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical Marihuanas has the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former-drug policy advisor to the Obama Administration believes that Kriminalbeamte probably no doors are leading to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but is likely to resist that, under the new legislation, state-regulated legal marijuana shops. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado did not even wait for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the election, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week decided Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> “We do not want to get into a position where we license and then somebody at the federal level have a huge problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the change in the law. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We have, for which the community has decided and did not ask for what the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many unanswered questions. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was bullied because I am a Tory </seg>

<seg id="2433"> As an incredibly tentative 18-year-olds, I was in September 1986. </seg>

<seg id="2441"> “Miss,” Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt died (now), “please translate the first paragraph”. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I came here. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face as from Kuchenteig, and quite unpleasant. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> “Weigern is Thatcher, french supporters to learn, or are they simply stupid?” he asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students kicherten. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Wallten tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> “I propose that in your leisure time, a few Französischstunden-so if you do too much with their social activities are employed,” Pitt knurrte me. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned with hängendem head in my room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That evening, I sat at the College alone at dinner, when someone easy on the shoulder tippte. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a Englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> “I know who you are,” he said gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is the way it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of Tory to be harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the incoming Tory claim, members of the Labour Party to be. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub later, I tried to block me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I cannot in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher&apos;s views. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> An incoming in philosophy, politics and economics, the irony is that as a conservative force in Eton College visited, said to me: “you are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins.” </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students who shared his views. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and bad way. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> “The tories have sex?” asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The beat each other, right? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt, as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation of the United States may have felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever get to Oxford University to lead a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would like only after dark can make? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress it? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years before me were spread before my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, who is openly as Tory was was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only for it to be hated, a conservative, but also because it Thatcher at foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place it was small-minded and provincial, rejected him for his marxist-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> “You will not be happy,” he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began, between Oxford and the house my parents commute and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated, Oxford and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed in disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the vierzigern all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> “But it is the best place in the world,” he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Something they would never do that, not in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes tarnished. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Give it a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure someone neckt you only. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart if you gingst. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakening. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, the pressure to renounce his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a Tutoriums during the following week, in which another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I secretly zerging in shame, I made that my parents had been subjected to “a brainwashing”, and called it “silly old.” </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career beating. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was closed. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Like you can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-olds should ever at a school in spite of such intimidation and have to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And it is even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory originated, but far behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought in hiding. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> “Valentino is elegance of celebrity” </seg>
<seg id="2502"> On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino-Master of Couture,” which opens this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other clients of the famous italian Modemachers. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the british capital, the accommodating an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> This has the designer with the opening of “Valentino: Master of Couture”, a bright Retrospektive, for the more than 130 clothes the Haute Couture were being compiled by his “Maison” over the past 50 years have been created. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> “I love that Palace,” he says, with his distinctive italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the conclusion of a story, the sole protagonist in “Il” Signore Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele would be written. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino had always been stickige and fascination for the distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, which will continue until March 3 to see, there is a wide range of private letters and photos with the signature of the erlesensten aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social advancement in the city by the modest Modemacher Voghera in northern Italy for the International Jetsets idol. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> In love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> “At least they are not their overturned on your beautiful carpet, as some celebrities do fine from the pop music,” says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular and elegant, more generous hosts. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> “We all saw us if we were invited to his house in Gstaad,” says the “Exfrau Heini” Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always been the elegance of celebrity instead. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And yet, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Also, the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the Modemachers not. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago we went into a Modeschau on Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music and its influence is felt. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> “All the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, which her career in the week of the Haute Couture in Paris began in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> “You never go out of fashion, because its design works of art,” she says finally.. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Latest origin </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The lives of Garavani is no history of Versessenheit of mutual love affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He may people with good education and top titles, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries in Somerset House was in a glorious and 60 meters long catwalk of transforming a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and the catwalk, along with a “fantastic” audience to admire masterpieces of Valentino, as, for example, the dress, the Jackie Kennedy Onassis for their wedding with Aristóteles chose the Kostüme, Monica Vitti in “La Notte”, or a wool coat and leather, the Empress Farah Diba belonged. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In this audience from Modepuppen emit as the name of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria from mail-coaches and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Abascal and Naty Modemacher, 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these much-say that the first Valentino is like the first love, “unforgettable”. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I can still remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a record type “Gillette” and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> “It was a present from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the Inter arma silent Musae the Designers. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> “I prefer it to all others because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty,” adds the former Duchess Feira added. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like the colours that he used, very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Princess and the fashion Meinungsführende Della Patricia Giovampaola d&apos;Arenberg can remember the first time, when she was wearing a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of the age and to have the opportunity to one of its Abendkleider … </seg>
<seg id="2539"> At the end of the 1990s, we had finally. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought me my first-Valentino dress for a festival in the castle I Vetters Edouard de Ligne, the Prince. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red dress with a flying rock and drapierten Oberteil refrain with a name. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> “It was a dream come true to hear about,” says the widow of Rodrigo d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> “Valentino depends not on the fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explained this italian Aristokratin between París, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Princess D&apos;Arenberg preserved their Abendkleider the Modemachers “with scrupulous care”, because “a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories.” </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The “king” of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the Hochzeitskleid by Marie-Chantal Miller for their marriage, with Pablo de Grecia in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Four months of work and 25 “Ragazze” (as the Modemacher his Näherinnen called) were necessary in order to this elfenbeinfarbene silk gown with 12 different beads, embroidery and a four-and-a - half metres long Schweif. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, was this dress is a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return to the top of the serve society.” </seg>
<seg id="2549"> For years, with the “savoir - être” of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award Cavaliere del Lavoro, Italy), Commandeur de l&apos;Ordre et des Lettres, the Arts awarded the Honour, Garavani added so many honors, as each of the husbands of his serve. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> “I always be sophistication, his calmness, his appearance and perfect gepflegtes noticed,” d&apos;Arenberg, too. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> I have given it the last time a month ago at a gala dinner in the de-Orsay museum. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the top table of Gräfin Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> “He was a stellar; the time leaves no trace of him.” </seg>
<seg id="2555"> And that says a princess … </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The most difficult job in the world: the human pests from Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four of the euro, the winner of the indonesian volcano, their lives and their health at risk if they have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter, their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He has every day, right down to the ground, where his Kraters rise from the earth ausströmende schwefelhaltige gas in contact with the air in tablets. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After great Schwefelsteine has fallen, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported them into two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope of stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to a level of 2386 metres but the exhausted bodies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, while the balance and keep their steps must be careful to ensure that they do not slip and fall. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> You know that every step of their lives can cost, as a french tourist happened years ago on the steep slopes of the Ijen Kawah plummeted. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Top arrived, they pave the path between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen taking photographs and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a Minengesellschaft a little further down a total of 1850 metres set </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, which they 662 indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilo of sulphur pays. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It sold them for 10,000 rupees (83 per cent) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in everyday life is widespread and the manufacture of matches, Feuerwerksartikeln happening, cosmetics, and even the bleaching of sugar is used. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> “As we normally 70 kg, we receive for each way around 000 rupees (3.8 euros),” says us Anto, usually three routes on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> For every line it needs three hours that he is fully managed, at the end of the day, however, he then 120,000 rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What a lousy pay for such an almost superhuman effort looks, however, is three times as much of what he would earn in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> “The Tagelohn Minenarbeiter here, where the Kaffeeernte 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day will be paid and the average monthly two million rupees ($167), is very high,” said the winner, who had previously as a builder on the tourist island of Bali was working. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that in Indonesia, as important as the sulphur is: “I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have them to Java brought them to convert to Islam.” </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases irritably. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27-year-old Anto sets for three years of his life at the Ijen Kawah on the line, the sulphur to him before the first traces, though he has his face with a mask and Spezialbrille covers. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases from the volcano irritably. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price for reaching his dream, he must pay. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> “I will be here two more years of work because I opened a shop or would like to learn spanish or french,” he promises, in a more than decent English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or reception at a hotel, but instead work he carried out the work of one Tragesels. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty Holzhütte with other agencies and is every morning at two o&apos;clock at night, because the sulphur ausströmt, where his distinctive yellow paint bläulich shine in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadow of challenging, it is rising in the light of a small Stirnlampe on his helmet, which he himself from his own money has bought into the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Approximately 400 vehicles, on the Kraterboden baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite their huge profits, the Minengesellschaft the mechanised Schwefelabbau not in order to cut costs, and gives the providers that are working on their own account and will be paid for by weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> You also get no benefit from the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this national park, along with the entrance fee of $15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists, the photography of the volcano and human Tragesel. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> “This work is for the animals and not for the people” protested Madrusin, a stämmiger, 42-year-old, winner of the three decades since leaving school at Ijen Kawah works. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is capable of up to 110 kg and assurances that he continues, “as long as it is”, because it had the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulphur&apos;s throat burns and eye jucken, when the wind suddenly turned around and the Minenarbeiter in the thick pillars einklemmt from the crater to intercept the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases … except, of course, the usual Arthrose, breathing problems, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets are distorted. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> With the basket on his back, with his flowing Unainik 53 years in the position, 50 kg. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his allies break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a Ziegenpfad between complain to the camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> “I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano all my life,” explains Unainik, when he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children working the grandfather with his 30 years as a sulphur-bearers. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the mediocrity, generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who as human Lastesel Ijen Kawah on work. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs the economy to save babies </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singapurer doing that they do not have children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> “The population of Singapore has to grow.” </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife, we are fulfilling our patriotic period and we create our lives! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons but, nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a Rapper-song, the local sayings such as “pushing is a “bao (loaf”) in the foot, through the low birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, the video has spun preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music that people wanted to get a “national duty”. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The Fortpflanzen, we are the worst in the world, which is why we have said that this is an issue that we have had to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the sale of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating evenings (quick flirtation). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who is this issue does not easily is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year they 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage more people to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But it has had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a hi-tech, wealthy city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to its national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time the rate was about 2-what is known as Ersetzungsrate-was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why not get the Singapurer more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Wei Ming Tan, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is a “better education” and “greater career”. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> “This has been possible for people, except to marry and have a family to provide more options in terms of life goals and to have to set priorities,” she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities of the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth contributed to the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy that has led to a surge in migration, the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites, where the little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who criticised the low wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election was an attempt, the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate the known impact on the growth of one nation, tax revenues, the health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore, unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to achieve that not so many small houses to be built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> It has already, impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has started, the number of small Appartements control as “Schuhschachteln” are known and in certain areas of the city build. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These have a Wohnfläche Appartements of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyles of the people living alone, and that it deters large construction firms, to build housing for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the EL Immobilienfirma Developers, says that his “Schuhschachteln” much more quickly than larger housing units will sell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger housing units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> That lead them to our cash flow are a great deal better. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He is, however, that the new standards are the developers of clearer guidelines, which previously obstacles placed in the way they were, if too many small housing units in a project to build. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore, a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could be the talks with the Singapurern in the City to work indicates that it will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> “The people are very stressed, housing and education is expensive, which is why many will be delayed,” says a young managers. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The other children can get. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> “It is important for me about my own money and time to have another one,” says about 20-year-old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women in their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons why they are not able to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Therefore the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The offline private offline is privately online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary, this is the capacity of private or “the area of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference.” </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for someone under the age of 16? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How will this definition to their everyday lives and the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> They understand the risks to which it is exposed to situations on the Internet if he makes it known that he would not share in real life? </seg>

<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, teacher of English with degrees in teaching and learning, says that children and young people to understand that it must be the purpose of the social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> “The Internet was created as a vehicle to search for information, with the appearance of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academics, Marc Prensky, holding a Masters title in teaching at Yale University and the author of “Digital Natives plant and Immigrants” these concepts in the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The Digital Natives, they are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> “We are the digital immigrants that they should have taught us, where we even learn how to do it,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that this is a complex subject, “because we demand that they have a defined criteria, which spread to be published or should be mentioned, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough.” </seg>
<seg id="2687"> “You should pick if it is the most important thing, to be loved, thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,” he added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people of what privacy is to ask them questions, they think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> “You have to tell them that they should not do, is not working,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras called then some possibilities: there are things you a stranger who would not tell us why do it then you on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or: would you like it if you have a photo of you published, such as the one that you have published a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> You are the other person&apos;s permission before asking if you have photographs of celebration labelled? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another question: what you need to know, at any moment doing? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another is that they understand that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> It is the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> “Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply for social networks,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully. </seg>

<seg id="2740"> “America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,” says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with “South America actually learn from Europe.” </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa on 6. summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), participated in Lima, Peru, the state television said that the Europeans “in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing” and “almost a mother country.” </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project, a south american citizenship to create the Member States of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> “Erreicht must be the free movement of citizens and workers in all latin american countries, as it already is in the Andean Community of the time, however, there is still a reactionary sectors which is aiming for a return to the past,” he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the Organisation of American States (OEA) below the target, the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and those that take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights have signed up. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who teach, pledge never to something and, in return, we sign the South Americans all the time. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> “It is incomprehensible that the Inter Commission for Human Rights, based in Washington, and will be financed by the United States,” he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he did not regret that decision because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his “deep democratic values and views on human rights” has fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it had been “well-founded suspicions that Assange be extradited to a third country and procedure was not respected.” </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the swedish justice system that requires him to have him on its territory because of an interrogation of alleged Sexualdelikts, while “the swedish jurisdiction it via a video conference, on the Embassy of Ecuador in London, may be carried out.” </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be disrupted. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> “Since then he has been in our embassy, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,” said the head of state of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger, though, that he would take some physical and mental harm because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors could carry out. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> “That would affect the health of every person,” he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa has said that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was granted the granting of a Freibriefs which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe&apos;s. he stressed that there had been talks with London to resolve the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, the word we use for this case in that it does not have, though, continued talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> “The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various european bodies”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> “And if the UK licence granted this morning, I feel that this is finished.” </seg>
<seg id="2759"> If Mr Assange in Sweden and the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogated on Skype, as the swedish case law allows and in other cases, is the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took advantage of the opportunity to make itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he would not tolerate “the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie of the freedom of expression.” </seg>
<seg id="2761"> “The worst enemies of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, journalists, but bad for profitability and blackmail,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador not more of such “journalists and not by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries dominated”, and, before that, when it comes to re-election a “the revolution will deepen the way forward in the right direction.” </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur dating at least to maintain its next elections, arguing that the body must be “tough and not of opportunism and not as legally verkleideten coup d&apos;état cannot accept,” because it “the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed.” </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire of his “other” Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua seerechtlichen privileged, with the borders between the two countries to negotiate for “absolutely right.” </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Currently, this judgment is not implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a south and a central american state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must in the pursuit of a common path to be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be fully treated so that they will be overcome and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that “it is right for Latin America, international bodies, if both countries pledge to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh.” </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in his third consecutive mandate to achieve, he admitted that he “that possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, though it is sometimes very difficult.” </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but under such circumstances as unjust in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> “My political movement had the belief that I was the one that likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I retreat from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This is also true when we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> “That has been decided,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I was just with Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment went there, and that he expected that after the election campaign again travel to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> “It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez,” he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The ecuadorean leader, today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) participated in the call for greater regional integration has been completed, in order for a sustainable progress, equality, and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the inquiry confirmed that HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> “It was as if a bombshell,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success “tried to weaken.” </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He chose to be alone with his disease and began to inform itself; and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients of the unity of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt “because it led to a dead end.” </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, many people are still in the hospital, none of their disease and know where the virus already has harmed and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world, i. e., the date of the first reported cases, means “the great success today that the survival of a patient&apos;s treatment in time, and the survival of the general population exactly are the same,” said the head of the HIV-unity of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life to the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment depended, and that those who do not have greater opportunities are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above mean that anyone under the age of 25 years of the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, “easily 75 years old can be as long as he is under control,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> This progress with properly needs to be reminded that the life expectancy of the Mexicans live an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report) reduced the ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS 60 per cent of the national database covered patients have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; it will, however, be assured that, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Why are people still die in that? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think the problem is not the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems of supply of the drugs; the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i. e. in a very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a striking statement: “nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. global mortality can influence, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where necessary, massive screening tests should be offered.” </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida (en) (Coesida Jalisco state committee to AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio to the test at a private laboratory carried out, and it was only because a friend he had made, despite his young age already in the AIDS era, and even the Kaposi Sarkom krebsartigen tumor - (a), as one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> “If I have to die, then it is better to burst” three times, as we say in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was designed to improve ernähre me out, I corner well, sport and take the medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> “I am working, doing much to have an active sex lives, but responsible, I respect on my health and that of the other person,” Fabrizio, counts on the agreed with his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they are already aware of the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Behind the counter condoms </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In some places it was “the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The Risikopersonen for new infections are among the young. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> “What do you need?” is a common form of social workers, Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, staff at pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested that these inefficient distribution to change the direction; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be encouraged promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They are not the beer and Motel will be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under its management condoms will be distributed. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> “Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms those closer to the sexual activity”, he got straight to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key facts of Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen in National 4. place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV. </seg>

<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered 4 or 5, there are people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group Vitro does not recognise, that have a Handelskonkurs in Mexico was reached a pernicious precedent for every national companies with operations in neighbouring created, the insolvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the mexican laws allow, in the land of stars and stripes in conflict with international agreements have no validity. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the judgment on June 15, recognition of the ruling by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale of the Northern District of Texas, the mexican company the confiscation of their property from the other side of the River Bravo helpless are exposed. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the decision opens up the largest Glashersteller in Mexico and, because of inconsistencies in three of the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2869"> Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of the country as “Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes.” </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before he by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first National League, agent and head of the BSN with the President or the Vaqueros de Bayamón Basketballverbands. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> “My whole life I have many basketball donned hats, indeed, several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and President of the Union was in the 1990s,” recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he met his wife, Isabel, trusted for more than 50 years, lives. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> “Basketball was my life.” </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is exaggerating with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In the heart of Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotionalsten memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, remember where his 15-year anniversary as manager of the club or Mitgeschäftsführer celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> “These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 as a manager or coach, Mitgeschäftsführer be allowed. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> It was rewarding for many years, including five finals in succession from 1971-1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said with a championship in 1981, the year of the Debüts Jerome Mincy to BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then took “Cuco” Ortiz, who is a very good manager,” says Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that my genes Bartow, here as coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a very strong and 2 metres in great players. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Would you use it?” </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow recommended then Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, acquire and one of our best Werfer was. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I know, even as he said that, if a championship for Mincy Bayamon Gausse, allowing for another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship with the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but even from a distance because, in 1988, he is already at the top of the association. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At this time it is, and the executions of Mincy to enjoy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we first vorolympischen at the tournament in Mexico against the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup in 1990, on the fourth documented bronze, which really should have been, if not this canadian referee would have been the last of us Spielzug repeat for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who used the Olympics in 2004 against the dream team won. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the United States offered a fight, as when it against us in the World Cup bronze won. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario Morales, the “Quixote” because of a 1990 Knieverletzung could not be present. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team which, perhaps, in terms of personality, not the best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, was the tournament&apos;s 1995 vorolympischen in Neuquén, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blockage of players because of the events in the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, despite every prediction, we won the gold medal. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without his career in different leagues, in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, Patents Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Armandito Dalmau, Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you believe is the best of what you have achieved in the club? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have imposed, e. g. the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The boys in Ponce, for example, only in their area, and only in the Playoffs on national teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, many of the children unnecessary travel and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, table-officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I like to listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and I can go to a Basketballspiel. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side. </seg>
