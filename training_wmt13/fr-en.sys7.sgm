<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Centre sees it as a myth, stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, the Republican lawyers have reported that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments passed from 2009 to new laws making it more difficult for the registration or voting process. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw it add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the single year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral law requires that voters have an identity card photo and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce periods of polls, invalidate the right to register as Polling Day and withdraw citizens with a criminal record their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state requires voters to present an identity card photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state to ask such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities moved rapidly to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card photo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card of health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people to vote, do not possess photo identification cards issued by a government agency in their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required ID. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the ID card photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, voters considered voting more for Democratic candidates, are not permitted in several states to use their ID card photo issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same states allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs who vote more Republicans to use for voting cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to make such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Moreover, Republican legislators have sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the rights of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 pushed the registration rate of 17% of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of polls. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same was true with Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, whites made up 76% of voters accounted for 46% of the electorate voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters were strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card photo. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics Democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, and they see it as a clear aim to influence the results in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What to do even more reluctant men already reluctant to undergo screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We sought the advice of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study found a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who did not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test out of 50 years, or from 40 years if you have a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others who are sleepy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of cancer, by offering options, treating not necessarily prostate cancers that do not affect the long-term life, and instead, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who are detected cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will suggest active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it accurately determines criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not we should go. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that makes it possible to assess the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (in English for the time being, a translation will be available shortly) at http://. Movember/en/mens/prostate cancer screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> There is no magic recipe for preventing cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one smoked, the rate would improve to at least 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many are also totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This greatly harms the health of people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; deplores the André Beaulieu spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer fell by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also encourage the onset of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity a lifetime protects against colon cancer,&quot; it is said. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too much, it raises the risk of getting colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Also, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explains it. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research is not conclusive at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;To pass a screening test, it does not have cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs hulled </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs has created quite a stir last summer. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that it is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, just that. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;less worse&quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure whether the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and it looks a lot like the Higgs predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be perfectly clear. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose it is the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law absolutely unavoidable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you will be hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yet even though particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that she, too, a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - the &quot;state&quot; loosely consisting of some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists classify the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely adhere to the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These particles are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, that will not be, and the &quot;particles of force,&quot; by which the great forces of nature spread and that the Higgs would be somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These particles, it must be noted here, are not all creatures as exotic as you might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to an extraordinary banality: the photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or changing direction, it &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field here, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; is a photon of light or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.), and this is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons &quot;with force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true with the Higgs, the difference is that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; to appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, just as if it were a frozen pond that only a very large rock could ride the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator such as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers circumference! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> These are not all particles, or all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, never takes itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (like the photon, wish) did not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what is &quot;can bring&quot; all these searches, asks Senator Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also a strong desire, because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and plugging some holes in the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we did not find such differences at CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of such research in the daily lives of ordinary people, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Consider: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Bell Laboratories, never suspected the revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, we have already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has developed the first continuous laser (the first was clean), in 1962, at the outset the laser was seen as a &quot;gimmick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, in the course of its work in perspective. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not his original intention, now serves as an &quot;eye&quot; in digital cameras in the world, and won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die.... | </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his death in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume shortly while a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this vital area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir tried to take a closer look. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer that had left him a two-year respite. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago,&quot; he said, figue mi-mi-raisin, lying in his bed at home for palliative Victor Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, you can&apos;t be prepared for it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is a huge weakness which prevents him from travelling alone to the toilet, and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat in front of a delicious lunch, he agreed to get help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him give his medication, offered him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I am recovering from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man, it stands up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept the regression, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the view of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor Gadbois all suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum of three months of life prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called curative care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Ms. A., 89 years ago, the worst fear is to die &quot;conscious and stifled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease showed me my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no more wishes in life,&quot; she says, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It expects in the next few days, a final visit to his son come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make it more comfortable death. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It&apos;s very little when we know that we all end up dying a day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions,&quot; said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> In the dying, we will accept mouth brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, it was used as a beer with Mr. X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who finished beer to the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help them as much as patients,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of health care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At home Victor Gadbois, the days go, but are not the same. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Alongside an old man of 93 years who savored his last meeting of family in the courtyard, well suited to his pillow while Pain in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after any attempt to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For the past six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer aged under 45 years of age,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to Victor Gadbois come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, hospital or nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as Victor Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home in Greater Montréal, specializing more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in health care in Quebec who fear several physicians in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto, signed by leaders of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health care system in Quebec is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to carry out euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I saw a patient spent 14 days in emergency rooms, in great pain, without the need for relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients do not want to die because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists are fighting on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The survival hopes of Helene Richard were already minimal when she gave up challenging chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop fighting,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Yet, she told me that I was finished. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thanked caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for palliative care at home in Greater Montréal, patients would be resistant to the treatment of pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors have resorted to palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, either intermittently or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you to euthanasiiez,&quot; this means &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The achievement of this story has been made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials from roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and experts from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know of a formidable &quot;system,&quot; a mixture of the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that has cost us dearly to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious as the system waned since it took the big ways,&quot; hangs Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, by means of a thorough investigation of corruption related to road work contracts in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had agreed reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report&quot; established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he said, the only Department of Transportation would have saved $1 billion on contracts,&quot; some réfrénant their instincts to receive a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission &quot;has already toppled two mayors,&quot; he says, in the hope that she reaches &quot;demonstrate the tricks behind people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The police &quot;Pauvros Squad&quot; which, since 2009, would have led the &quot;cartel&quot; of Montreal to put the brake on the swelling of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has carried out raids in the series and brought charges for fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resign from his post as mayor of Laval, third of Quebec City. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> They are formally charged by engineers at the Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, Tony Accurso and Lino cundeamor,. </seg>
<seg id="227"> He has raised eyebrows by explaining to the Committee on the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; to obtain public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait money in Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. cundeamor, sowed all winds in the 2000s, with more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also said he had organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts that it inflated costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was running smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, former engineer in public works, has been detailed before the committee: in 10 years, he has received gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes totalling 736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that it inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other road officials admitted he was spreading the raising of 30% to 40% bills, by false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget fueling its coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to pull the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the district of Rivière-desPrairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million developers, booming real estate. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation that will eventually be put in place, she said that she &quot;draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but it should be an investigative unit in Montreal and a day before, not to return the dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As is the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is concerned about the role of elected officials aware of the ruse, &quot; when they do not trempaient in the politicking! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Believing that 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he hangs: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations, but this will not change, he said: &quot;As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He advocated a complete review of the system for granting public contracts and financing of political parties: &quot;We cannot go lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on more solid footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to watch in their own backyard.... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The MTP is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken on a new scale with the MTP. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Why is this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the MTP. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I was making progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also been good. </seg>
<seg id="257"> On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the game, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not excited. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My debut at the centre of pre-formation Clairefontaine to my move to St Etienne, I always advanced levels. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Therefore, you take advantage of competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer recruits are accustomed to playing matches very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> What makes a player like me want to face and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is supported by assistants such as Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a great deal of experience and has won a lot of titles with upscale clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a comforting discussion with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> So I was going out of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Trust me also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Do you see the first part of the MTP season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the 8th final with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the goal of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we will have our say in response to very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to finish first in our group, with Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The MTP can become a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the GMP provides the means to make this happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In League 1, did not win the title, as the last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it was really committed to pocket this champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it has not gone far enough. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It has been a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It was finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be a champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and the players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It accepts completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to us, it is certain that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> You can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to set up a project for the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It has been demonstrated in the Champions League that they could attend. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In the light of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been &quot;turbo-charged&quot; by this new MTP. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The MTP seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that there is a &quot;Zlatan addiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to it, and he proves that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He has demonstrated wherever it happened that he was a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, you respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was committed to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab the game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I was strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I come to achieve good selection matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> That&apos;s what I was hoping since my baptism with the Blues. </seg>
<seg id="336"> It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Do you see the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the Premier League? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had achieved its goal in qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good one (1-1) struck, 16 October, Spain is a founding match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and the costs of treatment between the stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure protocol for the exchange of BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of peer-to-peer files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, has fallen to $2, five months later, before coming back today around a dozen dollars (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She described bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency, such as &quot;credits,&quot; used to move forward in a video game that you win by playing, or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually between two Email addresses in the manner of an Email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A series of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of double encryption key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded exist in the book, distributed across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It involves the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this extra line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase of hash file, which is processing a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number of &quot;chop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number that gives a special footprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once found, other knots check easily that it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the room.... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also noted for each increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen bitcoins deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The flaw is not related to the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company to pay real money using the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB is also the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash is also lacking. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the platform for blogs, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not found. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;balances giants&quot; have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,&quot; says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of an instructional book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement among the merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They only need to provide an address, a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, who has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report, expects to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States should follow in late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is the Afghan peasants we punished as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign army, such as the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will be more when the West will be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the hills almond trees planted through French credits, has been in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no Taliban onslaught on Kabul at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible step forward from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country FLAMES because of the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The most notable of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into business, seizing government land to sell the land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge US subcontracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They were addressed; most of them have not actually fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They flirted with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who won&apos;t want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its Turkish soap operas, which present a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities who will order be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already involved in reconstructing provincial militias, which will be irrelevant to the central authority. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States have tried to turn it into a centralised state structure, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country has, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> There was no road, no dam, no major irrigation system is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that Westerners &quot; were there to grab. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to deal with the iron ore or copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will be a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of French combat troops ended on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, in an attempt to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive action, &quot;civilian-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), eliminated in 2012, led and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and farm-rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, greedy local work, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmland. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What are we going to be remembered, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local conditions of life, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To ensure that they are free of the insurgency by foreign groups, what the farmers told me wish, it would maintain a small civilian aid in their favour, well controlled and affecting them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution in force in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new poker of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him full powers, he decided to play its protagonists. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Taking everyone short, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a draft text, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and led to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, President perseveres in his &quot;autocratic insanity,&quot; continuing &quot;betraying its word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a way to end as soon as possible with the political and institutional crisis by speeding up the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short time, forcing the Brotherhood to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers,&quot; these supposedly due to expire after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamic majority, voted against the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals were missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing it had not been able to assert their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to ensure that the necessary quorum, 11 people have been added in haste yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators have been amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was done improperly. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of all the attention, Article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that &quot;the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace &quot;principles&quot; by &quot;the rules,&quot; which would have allowed stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; are liberals, who see it as a communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because according to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They include Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar university an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify the compliance of laws with sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the expert in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrisome because &quot; people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the beginnings of a theocracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For the time being, there is no religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not scholars but academics, some trained in the French system &quot; temper Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the words go to religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It refers to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question could in future be the extent of the civilian judges are competent to decide on it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is widely criticized because of the powers it gives to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood argues that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Nor will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested by the associations of defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be fatal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, the press in particular. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Moreover, no article echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word was not included in the previous constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> While the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;Language in Moscow will:&quot; migrants save money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPs and activists of human rights polémiquent on what is going to give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling &quot;fake&quot; certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their sole purpose: to earn money to help their families back home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December, a law entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass an examination of Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and retailing. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It will be necessary to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Only nationals of the countries where the Russian has the status of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> People who have obtained certificates or education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other institutions of higher education in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities across the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened across the country. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce reviews has been supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what is it going to be? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know what the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, meet representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering &quot;from slavery to work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers,&quot; said the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service (FMS) in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of the rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organised selection will solve 90% problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the prospective migrant is intended to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping, will give him a &quot;trip&quot; in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of others have been tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and will have between 12 and 14 hours per day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We have received many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they promise one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, you take their passports, and they do not affect the planned salary,&quot; confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I do not stop the police! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia trust that they know not only the language of the country where they wish to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> This is obviously not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to take even a primary education fair. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even feed their children without talking about dressing properly and equip them for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people earn money as soon as the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It&apos;s hard when you don&apos;t know the language, they hand. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel diminished and weakened.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Defenders of Human Rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The exams will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or enter&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you can get a false registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, where cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; said reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Do it quickly, unhesitatingly and buys a beautiful work of art&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of the migrants were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The falsified papers come out of an ordinary printer colour. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners do not have for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Representatives of the power and defenders of Human Rights agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can provide migrant workers who have not been able to validate the test for the first time to attend language courses. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Moreover, immigrants who do not know the Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of Interior is not dealing with the arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of Interior is proposing to toughen the law against civilian carrying weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the authorities&apos; reaction to recent incidents: whether the shooting at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has made seven deaths. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raising the legal age for obtaining firearms from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who has promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everyone is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;tightening the screws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various fire centres, require abandoning &quot;this senseless tightening.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of laws concerning civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from buying on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, can be found in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of Interior says that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: the plant at the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market for weapons supplies via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> There are five main channels,&quot; said retired Col. Victor Baranets, who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screen shot from a site taking orders for weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is &quot;the military trace,&quot; i.e. the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,&quot; said Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons from the black market were stolen by criminals to law enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is both stolen from police stocks than those stolen directly to the representatives of law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of them have often suffered explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Certified versions indicate that some fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;You see private arms factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,&quot; said an expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A large proportion of pistols and rifles from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a local production, sometimes a mafia was formed and organizes supply,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts have analysed the reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data relating to weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain researchers, comes from the military and law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons found on the black market was found &quot;in the absence of employees whose work is related to weapons,&quot; it was suggested in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons from military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from &quot;excavations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="675"> A vendor and consultant who requested anonymity ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in the illegal search; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Most often, he says, sellers will seek new goods in military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys through a teaching unit, for example, a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The book by passing the goods through a fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;It flies in the city and sold it to 900 per unit with two chargers,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, for example, when crimes are on the verge of being investigated, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers,&quot; said the vendor. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;Like a luxury shop&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are usually in the form of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I consulted sites, blogs, until a type occurs and I propose to come to the station of Begovaya where someone was going to get me into a corner to haggle. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the pistol, I was given on the spot </seg>
<seg id="685"> Victor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, it is important that I know someone who has a contact,&quot; said the vendor. I know somebody, but I don&apos;t trust. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the markets, but there must also be said for example &quot;of the person, who asked me to convey that his daughter had lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy a pair of American fists in a person to whom I am confident. </seg>
<seg id="689"> It gives me the book only to me because he knows that I am not going to give. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Small new seek weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes, he said, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given a photo album in which there was &quot;everything you want.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I thought I was in a luxury store,&quot; remembers the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is no secret to the buyer,&quot; says Baranets, you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As a potential customer, I am not happy to buy, it goes with the vendor in the forest and installing a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I have learned, and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we are starting to negotiate,&quot; describes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A shop since his sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> Search engines display sites and Vkontakte groups where you can buy weapons &quot;for different purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> To this end, there is no need for any document and person to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It is enough to have a precise amount of money,&quot; wrote advertising on the site &quot;purchase a pistol or a submachine gun battle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> Users can leave their applications and raise their questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And we sell to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Without a permit, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;TT buys Moscow,&quot; wrote &quot;Fedorenkov&quot; in its very direct request. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and collect people who want to buy weapons of war. </seg>
<seg id="707"> People are rushing food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia </seg>

<seg id="709"> I have heard of this type of patterns: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of application of Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer makes payment on the kiosk. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;It receives back a photograph and instructions which is hidden the weapon,&quot; said the secretary of the association &quot;right to a weapon,&quot; Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and collect people who want to buy weapons of war. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;People are rushing food like hungry wolves and then they are to exploit coal in Siberia,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov for $100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of an illegal firearm, say experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the association &quot;right to a weapon,&quot; you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100 - 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It will take about a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> He came out of the warehouses long term by the management of these mid-sized warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of these crimes has declined in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs fell by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> USA: employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests is rising against the low wages of Wal-Mart supermarkets and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take off or weaken quickly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by unions and a number of left-wing associations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest wage increases that perceive employees at Wal-Mart and the fast-food chains, the organizers of the protests seeking the creation of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For the time being, this sector is not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the &quot;black Friday,&quot; when a freak rain seizing of millions of people swept across America and sometimes triggering clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On that day, some employees of the company Wal-Mart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their positions to organize picket lines with the unions and the left-wing activists in stores in the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Wal-Mart sells everything: layers to shotguns from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That&apos;s why many low-paid workers at Wal-Mart shop solely on their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of products have made Wal-Mart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Wal-Mart can afford to sell its products cheap, particularly due to the low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They are also complaining about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants of the events of &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased by 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the basic employee at Wal-Mart, which affects 9.5 cents per hour, it is an amount that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the California University of California at Berkeley have shown that if Wal-Mart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Wal-Mart put any increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would amount to 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Wal-Mart note with satisfaction that the protests have occurred in only nine states and there have been no harm to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;black Friday&quot; continued in stores from 8am to midnight the following day, and Wal-Mart has sold 5,000 items in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its funds have made at least 100 million transactions for the &quot;black Friday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post that &quot;fewer than five employees of Wal-Mart had left their positions and that the protest was a&quot; communication operation &quot; of the union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Next customer!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York and were not Wal-Mart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet implanted), but McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announces sell billions of servings and after you do not even sick leave and you do not pay the work you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage under the federal law and New York is $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants are increasing with time, but few average employees are New York 8.90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one affects less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> It is inconceivable for me to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald&apos;s after school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as their main source of income or wished to stay for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald&apos;s employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with them. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal includes comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don&apos;t know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 of the McDonald&apos;s near the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than two times the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They were also set up unions in the area of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters from a union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration rarely simplifies life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They disagree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day of the McDonald&apos;s near Times Square with the intervention of several local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of servings and after they do not even sick leave and you do not pay the work you have done honestly!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other Democrats New Yorkers, including by the candidate for the post of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot; we must all support the employees of the fast food they get a fair wage and economic wellbeing that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized this event as the largest ever fast food throughout its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people attended all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is now difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, there is only moderately to deceive the brain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Recently, fans of the new technologies have become accustomed to seeing reality increased through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Initially, it was Google, which unveiled its current model at its annual conference in November, we learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Dr. Shahram Izadi, scientists from the company, the glasses are already history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his hands, through the creation of virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> You could say a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and we are trying at the same time to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole remained at the moment to pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox are sold today because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> We reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although it has made the physical interaction, a lot of things go on flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D operating on different technologies, including the projection technology. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, making it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And for starters, let&apos;s get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> What do you think about the voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but isn&apos;t overrated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> We cannot say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we did not always want to inform others of its actions or its intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet gestures, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn in the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a clock. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + votes. </seg>
<seg id="799"> -? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you take this bear? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would do with words and gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Usually, I speak only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Therefore, you want to force users to adjust depending on what the machine can do at a particular time? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of human beings. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be an example of laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you are interested in your work on the Xbox sensors, what you don&apos;t like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> In principle, it is on the current generation that we use in our work on 3D recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> It would obviously get approximately 8 megapixel with a speed of 1,000 c/s.. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Compared to the last point, all current technologies are pretty good, it adds to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It should be borne in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is very important, too, the number of executives in the second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond gave the touch sensors on a regular schedule between 1 and 100?s, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60 - 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I need a device of this type in my work, but do not need to touch, to have more executives in the second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> But we don&apos;t want to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Now has three &quot;cameras,&quot; one is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the signal thought. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually a normal sensor in the visible field. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A lot of cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the required volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that a point of view of the daily use of technology in the augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands is not practical, but here&apos;s what I think: the best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality that you would from a platform to move in the smartphone glasses. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device and that&apos;s their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses won&apos;t get you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographic virtual objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem that opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands do nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group planning in relation to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In my course, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could very well be adding tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a medium of image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is perfectly the pressure! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute the palpabilité to these &quot;images in the air&quot;: for example the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed towards a specific point where the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the time being still weak, a breath of fresh air on the ends of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also an axis of perspective. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to mislead the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a job down here on which it will take a long time of evil: how to believe someone who is physically in a space so small that he works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of race carpet (nothing to do with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, there is only moderately to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt. </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;the vanguard Petersburg&quot; dedicated to city dwellers who find themselves in advance, at the forefront of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list has already hosted prominent players in the arts of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new &quot;Rosbalt&quot; hero is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The entire city is Kirill Miller, this rather bearded, dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in festivals and exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller always bring together the crowds, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> He is one of the storytellers at fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the vanguard Petersburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, smiling people and good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it has become a symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had sufficiently matured in this difficult role in his life, his philosophy and his image of a bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill, why do you tour the city in red and yellow or turquoise for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the red as a designer specializing in appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> While in society, everything that is not grey is aggression and a negative unrest. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to begin the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of old unofficial painters grew and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started to tie my friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya&quot; and then there is no wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it ended up in your art... - it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took Pouchkinskaya housed before a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: NOM, Tequila - jazz, I can still see Chnour come up with the project &quot;the ear of Van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang songs easily playback in skinny shirts, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer now in fashion. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to live, it became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg drove some emissions before the Gali Hali era. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We have given Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that he has received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> &quot;D137&quot; floor, &quot;Griboedov Club&quot;: this is the impact of the artistic Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are parties as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture wanted to say something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was named &quot;artist of the year,&quot; and that&apos;s when my reign ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a current and a very strong stance. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibit &quot;the Russian museum through the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was somebody, now it hurts and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world through the full and mandatory disguise. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress that is important, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Perhaps you can&apos;t give him a hand, but instead he spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be erased by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently we have seen in the role of the organ player - a cultural city must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else I can play. </seg>
<seg id="896"> But perhaps commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today&apos;s commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the dumb one. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into small communities, it is hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, you have to think about who you love it. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> These are people who come to see is the sexual and social side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately less management, money, everything languishes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not wrong, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the usual tables are those that are painted in the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, it is often confuses ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It is said that there are spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money specifically for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Kirill, what&apos;s missing in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the culture official. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone can work in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> During the reign of good, it wasn&apos;t like that, Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St. Petersburg who may be experts, but they are excluded because it requires higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> At present, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot; which flourished. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, there are painters who have to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> For you, what is St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture, there is a ground for this. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art has struggled to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers, it&apos;s bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there is a lot of curious who are going to see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> At home, this layer is very thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make art in fashion, as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with land aboard are searching for a backup planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to keep our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is little choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are two true planets that can be won, even by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It&apos;s Venus and Mars,&quot; says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the Institute of State astronomical P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If Mars conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> We cannot live at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It has begun to address the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a century ago, it was conducting experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit in no way differed from earth varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, it has been put in orbit insects, small breeding Drosophila flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get to exit a chick quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find support, it must be put on their legs and begin to move,&quot; said the director of the laboratory of the Institute of biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By finding no support, chicks stirred disarray. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours, the new born saw their instincts completely atrophy. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were neither light or sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they died just at the end of four days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We have been witnessing the eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The latest biological &quot;miniature ark&quot; with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the &quot;Bion biosatellite&quot; ship that species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, we have discovered nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience this kind of research is needed,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it does not yet make reproductions directly into space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is not a simple matter. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instincts. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, human beings are capable, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional substance. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women go into space for 50 years now. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity is more valuable. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our seagull went up and no one on Earth could not say whether he would after a flight in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody responded to this question,&quot; said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Andrian Nikolaïev was also astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and have worked even axiomatic, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very few cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during the flights in orbit,&quot; concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia hero, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory hydrology of the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts: mandatory step in preparing for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular exits. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment for infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Insofar as the baby grows about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the mother&apos;s womb, it is easier to get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is in principle logic, because since its birth until its first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It&apos;s very little to forget,&quot; explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a nutshell, if the child who is born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitational force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis decreases very quickly, the ability of the baby boom is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> OK, do not know that based on birth simulators. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is of course preparation for childbirth in a special chamber, the woman will get him out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then?&quot; asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite them to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the Earth&apos;s attraction, the agency does not form the skeleton and the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t wear an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It simply will be deprived of its vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience that we would seek in this case by imagining the birth of a child in an environment abroad will return to Earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté, provides for the Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Medicine - biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in space is still theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time this will become reality, when the world will visit their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the ISC (Supreme Audit Institution of public finances) said: &quot;The control of the pseudo self-employment (Czech&quot;?varc system &quot;) has failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has qualified inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in terms of its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what Miloslav Kala said, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview with Aktuáln?. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking for us,&quot; said Kala in his comment on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> An inspection carried out jointly by Czech and German inspectors would also suggest similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot;?varc&quot; by Petr. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not disturb contractors with controls; it is therefore permitted or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent action authority to inspect to demand compliance with the law,&quot; notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> During the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-Polish German project which has been compared the legislation in the field of public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it in practice? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the European legislation provides for how to manage the procurement and specific national legislation as well as an actual practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have collected and although this monitoring procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be &quot;tougher and better,&quot; however, according to some parameters, the practice itself is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continually develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How does this project can help you in practice and that is it for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should help ensure that we get to try to clarify the law, to reduce and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find a lot more opportunities than if the threshold was higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems regarding the implementation of the procurement legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organisation? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In terms of institutions, similar to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly, there is also a board constituted a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it is also at the level of the Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to the national legislation, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I don&apos;t want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we cannot say that it is better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, we must also say that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> The amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet impact on our screening operations. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we make control afterwards there is some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations relate to, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new tool for &quot;risk detection of mismanagement&quot; with which we have vetted nearly 14,000 public markets - of course, these changes will be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you consider, therefore, the adoption of this law rather as a benefit or a burden for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can happen is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to respect them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the regime of the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forces controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it useful to make the law more stringent in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not this way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decisionmaking process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> What is the solution to get out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look where we are not going. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with control of the so-called?varc system - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The?varc system is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent action authority to inspect and require compliance with the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We are going to change the law and authorize,&quot; but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the market has relatively strict rules on formalities to be completed and precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking at home. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads are frozen places, but most remain open. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network remains largely practicable, in some places with greater vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary region </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were this morning, but by frozen places and also snowy. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 and -10°C, but they should increase slightly in the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The snowfall ceased in the region and in the plains have only a thin layer of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The ridges of the metal (the Kru?né Iron) are still covered by about 30 centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> According to data from the regional maintenance of the roads because of the fog, visibility was reduced places. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The R6 fast track and the national roads in the region are now passable without difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Vigilance remains, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All roads and pathways of third category, including mountain roads are also impassable. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> There are still some sections of the remains of frozen and places slowed down by traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Regions of Pardubice, Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> Roads and highways reported on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow packed by traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous areas and located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The maintenance of roads warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan?kroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poli?ka, Svitavy or Tatras, mainly on the road and third category. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> Roads I/43/34 in the vicinity of Svitavy have been chemically treated. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> Snow is primarily in the Giant Mountains (Kokono?e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické Iron). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn??nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in areas located at altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> In Eastern Bohemia, the time today will be dry, most often reached with potential cloudy. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> It will blow a low wind and temperatures will vary widely between -3 and +1 C. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Pilsen region </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Roads in the region of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise greater vigilance and adapt its behavior to weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It freezes this morning, temperatures ranged between -3 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After the recent snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen places. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility will be improved gradually. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> This is what it appears from the information of the regional road maintenance service. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The D5 motorway goes almost without difficulties, maintenance of road communication recommends greater vigilance between 80 kilometres and 131. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen South and in the district of Tachov. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The departmental channels and third category are wet, and in this case applies the warning against the frozen sections. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on roads less crowded in the area of the?umava. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Drivers travelling in the areas of the region of Olomouc located in altitude must now count with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> This layer remained on the so-called &quot;?ervenohorské sedlo&quot; and on the road in the direction of Videlský k?í?, after the chemical treatment. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The snowfall forced overnight maintenance of roads to travel on the ground, according to the services in charge of the roads, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of?umperk. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> &quot;On the heights of the district of?umperk are remnants of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Drivers in the direction of Euracademy&apos;s should expect &quot;?ervenohorské sedlo&quot; a thick layer of snow and soft, &quot; said today ČTK the head of the maintenance of roads in the district of?umperk. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Their colleagues in the district of Euracademy&apos;s went up during the night, according to them, after the chemical treatment, roads are now open and wet, even in the highest areas. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> In the district of Olomouc roads are passable with difficulties in the district of?ternberk drivers should be careful in the sections in forest areas remained wet. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Ústí nad Labem and Liberec </seg>
<seg id="1098"> As early as this morning, the maintenance of roads in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> According to data from the police, in addition to certain areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and thus the snow and ice should remain on roads in the plains, particularly in the south of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem, and the roads are generally dry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> No traffic problems were reported at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially in the vicinity of?t?tí. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for his training: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> It also points out, since the main axes of movement, difficult conditions on National Route 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches bent under the weight of the snow to reach the road. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Ornest?imon said: &quot;Together, we want to collect the positive energy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love to fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap rather laugh and say that we are the only group able to collect the remains of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, you climb in December, a project quite unique: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you provide more detail on this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity that we are preparing for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11 10 o&apos;clock in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will be completed almost as ending the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, a time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who has had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think it was my idea, then we have developed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and the original key to the end of the world, by buying them online at tap. People can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled &quot;end of the world canceled&quot; (Czech &quot;Konec sv?ta zru?eno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, will hear it at these charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems also will join at a given moment in the context of a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The lyrics of the song were written by Tomáš Hanák who is also the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We are working with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we hold many concerts and charitable events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to engage intensively in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and it&apos;s fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with limited mobility and which we are working to achieve in the framework of the Jedli?ka institute, with the association Tap, and that for the past six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers visit regularly with students from the Jedli?k?v institute and propose activities that interest them and play. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli?ka Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and performers will perform on stage in each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria do you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will perform on stage Chinaski, Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jirì Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You can find all the details on: kpks. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Also prepare for other &quot;mega events&quot; of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the context of the Prague Spring; again, we will surely have a quality program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I&apos;d like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you handle the organization and logistics of your tour? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not so terrible that it looks at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in the electric wheelchair must travel, of course we also trimbalons a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything has more or less always gone,?SA and British Airways were always fully prepared for us, they have surprised more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access for people with limited mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards the disabled and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiences so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only electric wheelchair in the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet consider evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there is also an association trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> How do we still catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There is a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and developments always depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap moving only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, at the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary at the forefront of progress! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and famous lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years ago, what you drove in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started working as an educator at the Jedli?ka Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am a musician (I play the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music business. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with time, as our moderator Lá?a Angelovi?, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success has happened over the past few years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> This is true, to create links with singers and work actively in promoting the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, in addition, we can afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The show business is full of tips that mimic each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In some ways, it is logical: everything is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who we see for the first time is, of course, it is natural.... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a life full and flourish, provided the necessary means, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities are able to do something, this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Is that your success is not due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by a lot of people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come here with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they need to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one, Lá?a Angelovi?. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come and go, you can&apos;t help it. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want or wanted to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the case on the eve of the scheduled date of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21:00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in the Incheba arena in Prague, Brno at Fléda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when jointly sung the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;end of the world set aside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre which is located in the Jedli?ka Institute in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the tickets are open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full fledged member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had engaged in close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has been involved in a number of projects in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Poland&apos;s road to space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they were not always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like to mention the conference of A.?ternfeld at the observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from her pioneering book &quot;introduction to space travel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left viewers cold and years later?ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski turned his attention to his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934,?ternfeld won France&apos;s Robert marques and André Louis Hirsch for his book &quot;introduction to space travel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a big propagateur of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski has become a propagateur of the world-renowned astronaut, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Since 1925 was built in Poland a hand car intended to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> There is, unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or curb the hand car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only known information on the hand car are those of the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to focus on the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> According to the documents that this research had reached the stage of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the searches were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, plans for a hunting photoelectrically rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi?ski, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba i lotnicza&quot; by an author named Leliwy Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects were aimed at military use of the rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all projects using the technique of rockets were being carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo - Naukowy&quot;), who coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war ended. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish company Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish company Astronautics (PTA) efforts to enter the International Astronautics Federation (created in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice president of the International Astronautics Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He kept his office until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Starting in 1956, the ATP made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had an 80 cm long and weighed slightly less than 5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently built an improved version, RM - 1A, and during summer 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket was launched in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket par-34 should have a range up to 14.5 kilometers and be used to observe the wind at altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development work was halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, led to the first rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor 1A, 1B and 1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor rocket - 1A had an area with a volume of 0.4 per litre, whereas in Meteor 1B this volume was 0.34 per litre and Meteor 1C of 0.62 per litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor missiles were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials started in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor rocket had an initial weight of 380 kilograms and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kilograms at an altitude of about 60 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently they built the Raytheon versions - 2H and Raytheon. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland has also been involved in space exploration on Soviet space satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second Soviet cosmonaut program. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on utility work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision was raised in the public a lively discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with a financial excessive speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The significant differences in the price of labour (wages) generate tension on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer attempts by the importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition by making it more expensive &quot; the price of a competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and to increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear, the result is a high unemployment in the countries where prices are high compared to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thus responsibility for unemployment it creates, payroll taxes necessarily increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage to the whole of society by this race. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital are resulting in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of the private capital without taking into account the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is evident mainly in the amendments of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to compel economically its own people to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This happens through a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and deepening of differences between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there has been for years public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already millions of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries that the government is forced to pay extra to ensure that they reach the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economy of virtually all Member States in the south of the EU are, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), either to eke out a living with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital investment in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here we have to ask the question: where will this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty from one country to another; this capital may not come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also applies to Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media say, that the state cannot make capital investment in its own economy, that the economy run led to an economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital in favour of the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then you have to wonder if the private capital does not influence, and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the entire state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer is undoubtedly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby and present in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is wrong, but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The entire power does not come from the people, such as the Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled &quot;the Crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Julius Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The state had long been deteriorating and functions were assigned by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The kickbacks and corruption have increased without limits and people went to the elections with votes already sold... the honest people were unrelated to obtain functions, the result was once the state was 8 months without Consuls... &quot;&apos; really began to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man...&quot; it is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who has transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, now as in the past, a decline of elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> So we have to look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of affairs, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current elites ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, social and humanitarian crises that we are now witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by the old and recent history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on utility work is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is indeed systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution consists of reforms referred to social policy, which will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing ever comes out of violence and never will,&quot; says Sting in the song Fragile whose main refrain is &quot;let us not forget how much we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my son did not want wars, there would be,&quot; said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her death bed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some take the party of Israel, citing its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in his recurrent waves of killings; in short, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a point of view located &quot;behind the curtain,&quot; benefiting mainly from the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern countries. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others have emerged from my own understanding of that, or rather the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so obvious is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they were to their acts to the throne to someone who led their actions in terms of objectives set out in advance. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in an era when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don&apos;t know if these families still have a leader, but I do not excluded). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they have acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious crimes to which they were involved and who had always meant for a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major holdings in almost the majority of the world&apos;s central banks and preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Qaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America, the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war of its own money (I&apos;ll) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to make money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the EDF for triggering the economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power at the global level led in 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was designed to eliminate the big state monarchies in Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including British, and the third is expected to reduce the world&apos;s population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution), and in the end, acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (ab chaos - chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to ensure that there is no repetition of the crises such as those they began in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Russia in the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany to a war reparations creating the conditions for a radicalisation of impoverished masses (then they only need to put a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (she was actually fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local Arab population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948, the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire area that can lead to a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab population or Muslim generally in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a mistake causes another mistake in a circle of violence without end and where, at the root of all the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It should make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like us, international bankers do not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascisant politician, fair to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) spread to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 percent of the world&apos;s oil (this corridor has a width of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> What light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which any new born is implementing birth an electronic chip to be completely controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;They are all individuals, large or small, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or forehead a trademark red iron, so that he could not buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this wild or the figure of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> We need to understand: that the person who has common sense figures in the wild. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number refers to the man and is six hundred and sixty six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Argo film: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students stormed the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which backed his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to secure the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, compounded later by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate was in the United States, a wave of solidarity and a feeling anti-iranien. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The Argo film, the actor and directing Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is occupied, six employees are out of encirclement of the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get out of Iran through a daring coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team filming location for the filming of a blockbuster science fiction film. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Gender mix </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The expert in slipping Tony Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines of this film, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation remained long secret, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a political thriller designed realistically, but also a &quot;we movie,&quot; the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - such as, for example, in the Ocean&apos;s trilogy eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The move: Tehran sequences documentary style (subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these pictures, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in a remarkable manner. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Ridiculed actor, he became a respected stage director and his player has ceased to elicit wry remarks. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third film after the dark cop &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first Affleck film that is not taking place in his home city, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put his first films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran &quot;is bound&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in streets, during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the collapse of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that would suggest the confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, wrote a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many shares in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The film and stage director has had to contend with a few exciting scenes in the film sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He fared very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a phone call in America and the prosecution on the airstrip are fairly drawn by the hair). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood members, their characters deserve a greater place and it is not far from here, only in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Affleck lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he is a moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the styles of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services, such as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server: bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry into the bank charges the most absurd, decided to launch the competition or ideas from &quot;EU workshop&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40% of women for the management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision,&quot; said the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Some of the nonsense mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision by the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far, however, women were better off in terms of insurance rates on life because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report until the end of the year, any other idea incredible &quot;the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013,&quot; he advised. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuel, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of using the term &quot;butter&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the European Union, bananas must not be less than 14 cm or present an &quot;abnormal curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonise national standards not homogeneous complicating trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruits and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some Member States, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded to the settlement of the EU in this investigation last year that must appear on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has made reference to a US survey that balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years in terms of blowing trumpets show. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> For us too, we have bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the &quot;let&quot; association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.COM has appointed in this investigation, in addition to absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set maximum volumes for the supply of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic was second, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risqua, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas are not from Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact of not having a sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union a refund.&quot; as expressed in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following the so-called &quot;interventionist&quot; purchases, the state got full stocks that he then had to export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> At the end of the day, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and held a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for obtaining grants have been proposed in the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel N?mec (US - DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write requests for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU states: &quot;The bizarre regulations are rare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations often provoke criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, deserve more praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the European Union, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these traditional products (which it does not always wins) has been an emotional issue for the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have defended successfully the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky,&quot; in which the name &quot;Tuzemský&quot; which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzemák.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the alcohol of cane sugar, not sugar beet, can wear the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products from the EU, is now in the company of world-famous cheeses such as feta or Gorgonzola, the Luebeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarské suchary&quot;), the Poho?elice and in carp (&quot;Poho?elický T?ebo?ský kapr&quot;) and hops?atec (&quot;?atecký chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread Pardubice (&quot;Pardubický perník&quot;) and cakes called &quot;mid-1865 Ho?ice&quot; (&quot;ho?ické trubi?ky&quot;) can also be proud of their Community trade mark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want to save the Republic, but I&apos;m just an amateur, says Senator </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Senator, how did the idea of standing in the presidential election? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president who counts for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything was operating without problems in our country, I am not a candidate anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I no longer bear to see it as the country has been plundered for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement are increasing. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I didn&apos;t have the ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t want, then I try to find a solution to that change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation to come to the Senate or presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered the Senate, but you quickly put on the road to the castle (N.): seat of the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do you not go back to those who have elected? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I am in the battle for the Castle, according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Subsequently, I pointed out that if I were elected senator, I will come back to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument which will allow me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That&apos;s why I need the greatest influence and the broader mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television, but it is also that we are stalling those who are trying to bring change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This is the press that breaks the reputation of people and freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, it said in my speech I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Turning to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have begun the fight for the castle with pet projects the themes of the physical and criminal liability of politicians and tax returns retroactive beyond 20 million CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of a tourist guide as a liberal profession, I have won. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is easily outmanoeuvred: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused, and it delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent, a member of any party, I am much more likely to win the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take each party what is best for our country and implement. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You see yourself as a man of the right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people are rather left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, whether a little left or right, this is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What matters to me, it is not that people are left or right, but to bring people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution that contributes to the public good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS, and I am equally impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you said does not prove? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to get closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about have been applied by the world and experts have spoken. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, it&apos;s only a slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You do not long survivrez in politics with it. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you go to see people and tell them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the physical and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get to my camp in order to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the physical and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should eventually explain why they do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality that will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been achieved through the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I must admit, bluntly, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and my views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just throw myself into politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try only to move things forward, and if it doesn&apos;t work, I will stop in six years and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It&apos;s a bit like if needed to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person cannot make a difference, that&apos;s why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come to the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met with participatory Jan?ura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> At least I gave the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I came because people are really upset, but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not vote and, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, there are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, such as the election by direct suffrage of mayors and governors of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to base your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I don&apos;t have time to check whether the history of each potential member is spotless and then I don&apos;t have the financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for my presidential campaign, I only twenty thousand on my &quot;transparent&quot; account. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You do not have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about tax returns, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think about 60 million the value of my personal property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I was in Prague a field worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth around 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda SUPERB with a value of 1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was compromising with women and fought against evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million, and you do not have money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic, but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have $15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should go into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great deal of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I have no obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I will receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live, for example, pay the English school for my son, which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only goal was to earn money, I did not introduce myself to any election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will continue your business to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Did you say that you would put your activities in the background? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the amount of such remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will spring the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But even though I live in something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in Saturday&apos;s edition of the newspaper Práva. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the MVRDV office show that the real adventures are not just imagination. To convince, it is enough to look at Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think it&apos;s funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a nearby large company, said: &quot;Yes, it is actually nice, this building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody goes voluntarily in one of these libraries of yore? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a special record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brain drain, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful miniature small reinforced concrete painted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> As a result, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to resume the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the architectural firm of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold diagrams and creator of buildings witty and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and ran the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury is still watching, bewildered and shrugging his shoulders, Maas, the brash, his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech arguments activists backed by a &quot;common dear!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, or as they say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros poured out of land. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project including an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books has received the second prize &quot;Best Library of 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, this small town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian mall and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades suggest they contain a dairy, has grown from a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the a-value </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: paradise of the book under bell cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Of course, an elevator brings you back to the heart of the massive, but the real joys of a-value and architecture are open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior entirely of glass is bright and clear, soil in Dutch bricks and elegant street lamps speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public places. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking in the eyes of the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all of the books, books and books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; said Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and open spaces of a-value from inside to outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, railings and stair ramps. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for sight, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers in the building do not want unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Thus, one day we found in a farming business Frisian an ad hoc waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, it is used for years of the synthetic membrane thick as a substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It&apos;s cheap and it saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, plates of a thickness of four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the effect of heat and pressure, the &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including the smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the stairs 105 is the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of nearly 500 metres, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, but also of Dutch nuggets and potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They create an atmosphere, but above all, they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It&apos;s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology,&quot; said Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books lies under a glass bell, the sun lights up little time inside, even the days of good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams mounted over the facade of glass are used, intercepting a large part of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The atmosphere is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The automated blinds take care of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already been risky to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig was already there too. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described the Boekenberg as &quot;the soul finally found&quot; Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago, at the time of the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully furnished (today, it has 70,000 books). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full of all sides. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if only for decoration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> As a result, MVRDV has reached the discipline known as, in the professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Even though it may seem young and poorly educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has chosen the abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinian observer state to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then, she has chosen the abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must exercise caution, because it has special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support the US position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention in the vote on setting up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the European Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans therefore face a number of fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy &quot;more normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, such as France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That means the term &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to take positions independent from those of the United States and European partners, including in relation to national issues. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced Germany&apos;s position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstain from the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That&apos;s why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is undoubtedly a key element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I do not give too much importance, because it is not exclusively one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case, this is a key element in the German strategic thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany affect its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that Europeans and Americans understand the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe Germany will only be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the US domestic political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course not defend his position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastic about the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany is finding it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it does not make things easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans if there was a European policy consistent and uniform, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot register within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is what they are currently in the question of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been tricky. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany is playing a role player in weight on the international stage, Germany wants to play a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is it always difficult to assume leadership roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at, for example, the crisis of the euro, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not make things easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this perspective, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must deal with neighbours and very varied opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the United States&apos; influence on the European policy is diminishing, but at this time, the EU does not fill the void, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will only need to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if they don&apos;t like it, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, that&apos;s life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name is a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand is such that the company that bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if she could, it is not sure she would win. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of property in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new record arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators need only a few extra letters to be able to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, there are Lu - Gucci and Prada, there are Prada - Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also copying legally, such as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a folder where registrations from the Trademark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has filed trademark Zegna TE Puma, a name that the firm was artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It&apos;s a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of the copy and the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities, there are malls on several floors selling and only counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents to deal with the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak of &quot;bang Mingpai,&quot; parent brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from &quot;bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are designated women who marry wealthy men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It&apos;s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,&quot; demands Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The mark is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the flagship expensive products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third largest market for luxury goods and the one that develops more quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to write off the dubious records of the register of trademarks and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reports on the trial in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name had become a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch says that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be forced to pay money, because it would have been detrimental to its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also involve graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of construction machine Sany, the same company that had bought the producer of concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, Volvo Data-Loggers, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely was forced to change. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against Même in Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits having experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the Office would have spent the last year of an &quot;emergency situation in the course of the work in a restored normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> For example, the number of opposition procedures untreated would have fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications for the trademark, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the office, it is a record and this means that China stands for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This should also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each recording reported average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle will cost much more, as illustrated in the case of the German family business chain. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Of course, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese trademark chain. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault, because the family names cannot be protected in Germany,&quot; said Hanno-Ring Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the objection of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has won two following bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Vigilance is </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praised the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, he added: &quot;The procedure is long, difficult and it costs a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the actions of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side a &quot;lot to six figures&quot; to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This is what we can see what it means for us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if the region&apos;s imitators ensured the exploitation of unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a company to produce footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;Vigilance is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advise the German companies to exercise caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, according to them, to rely on the international trademark law, foreigners should also register in China everything that is likely to be protected,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Day World AIDS: foot-stamping, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The Imbongi choir repeated in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> This is the story of a relationship that is much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, the slap of the foot: the cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies and moccasins for men seeking the pace by striking the ground very quickly, they find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, the voices of the singers escalate slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano, they win, and follow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses its canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeated a new song in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 came, the geneticist in human medicine man at home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos; Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each choir member has different words, in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland has 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association &quot;Voices for Africa.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them are enrolled in a high school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This amount ensures the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi in Zulu means &quot;storyteller of stories&quot; or &quot;praise singer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly 10 years, the choir repeated songs in the foreign language she has worked in Germany for now in his native region: southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> For 8,733 kilometers bird of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of people </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 residents, some of whom live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 among them are orphaned because HIV won their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> At Esitjeni, we can see smaller scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection is the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees yet proven a reduction in the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the thirties. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, the Imbongis have seen many children in the street which lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country without school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the outset, it was only a few people who personally agreed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer a hot meal per day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely a year later, the choir was &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; an association that has since almost professional AIDS orphans to Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Bacterial infections include syphilis, chlamydiées and gonorrhea (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The current infections are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic infections. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four out of five reported infectious syphilis cases in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of HIV spread between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, there is a rate of infections related to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the evolution of the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately bonus cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared with the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause genital urinary pain, loss, pain in the lower abdomen, and the emergence of buttons and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can we protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Experts recommend to anyone who often changing sexual partners to get regular exams. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the infections detected quickly can be cured, and the late effects can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that reap the singers through their voices throughout Germany, accumulate. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of themselves, who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that the orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> There is the so-called old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go every day at school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan is greeted in a safe place for Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 starving children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two barns. With the assistance of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized a HIV testing for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is visible across the country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is a real taboo,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is an issue that affects sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It&apos;s pretty curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in the place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These mores sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> There are condoms on every street corner, &quot;says Annette Lennartz,&quot; but almost nobody uses it. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Culture is different, flesh against flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers are travelling every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the edge of the black continent are still having the time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes also squeezed a tear to a few formidable guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitjeni, you will find light,&quot; say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, in front of these singers who tap their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Strasse, there is also light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The layer of ice could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains water frozen, as explained in three studies published Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably came from comets or asteroids may have hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, no link between the discovery of water and the assumption of life on the planet,&quot; said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, they send images to the ground, such as small cracks through which we look at infinity. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet,&quot; according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;babies&quot; in the delivery room of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where stars are born, called &quot;W5,&quot; a little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, about 6,500 light-years away. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the bright glow of a star dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the vast Trifid Nebula, discussed light-years away from Earth, gas and dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birthing room. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades cluster of stars also called &quot;the Seven Sisters,&quot; can be observed with the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope is putting more colours in value. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this infrared photo, the Propeller nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> His similarities with a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and the infrared camera can observe a spectacular hue. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn&apos;s rings. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared, there are 4.5 billion years without trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and most photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope is the galaxy of Twister. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the hue, photographs of spirals can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Trifid comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the gleaming heart of the place of birth of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of murder: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies merge rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble Space Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you don&apos;t like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of &quot;wheel of fire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Céphée. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The black hole is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current house dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was developed using optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle composed of black holes, which is 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies known as Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy &quot;1810.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1830"> This is the group of the brightest young stars in our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The celestial cradle always gives rise to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are linked by the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars at 8,000 light-years away from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> We look at the universe: major telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo utilisât a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see ever further into the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter is about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its uniqueness lies in its great ability to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;) using the computing power of his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> The Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope (&quot;very large telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a very large telescope every Large Telescope is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive height of 42 metres, it will be composed of nearly 1,000 pieces of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory to observe the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of the mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration makes it possible to admire. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the most important space from the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990, we book images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found $1.235 planets since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be tasked with finding the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists believe that the South Pole is also home to the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data on this theory exists because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar data indicated that for decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> With the launch of the probe in 2004, the first orbiting around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young at 97 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young at 97 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip to the mountains Talysh is an unbridled romanticism. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Looking at the many twists of the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, looks almost like in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which little is known, except that they are fluent Persian and Azeri and they have a great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminal: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era, which is not in keeping with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles because the road has only one route. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May, thanks to the Eurovision contest, and the next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; said Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> There are the lives of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who have more than 100 years, Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Still have a child at 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is?irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is no birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when you think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems to be more than questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,&quot; said Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and he would have been 23 children, at the age of 136 years, he would have even designed a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> ?Irali Müslümov would have erred in calculating his age of a few decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Surprisingly elderly people also live in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia, too, there are men who are incredibly old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is nevertheless a fact that people in the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> What is the reason for longevity in the south of this country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the Talysh energy-dense meal, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the young people? Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives in Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years old, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the floor beside a churn, which she beats content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children also have in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for guests served in armadus glasses typical in the form of stomach. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding long braids of a dark blond that his son reveals with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always washed my hair with milk, and so I have never lost and they have kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In all my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took orders. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He has been in power until 2003, his son succeeded him thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Whatever the case, the elderly do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the long greying son of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;Seniors have a great respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;Human rights&quot; omitted in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has surfaced in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not a man of few words full of emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to make a successful transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was aimed at the entire people, but especially the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslim and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition confused and desperately divided fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, having temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its own &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, holder of a doctorate from the American University of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary will be overthrown? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly muslim of 100 people during a nighttime tour de force of 15 hours are indeed worrisome to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft stipulates that the jurisprudence is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was, and it is always a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the legal leeway resulting to apply a more strict interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case suggests a newly introduced stipulating that, in relation to all matters relating to Sharia law, the Al-Azhar university must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance shines across the Sunni Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative process, resulting in de facto guardianship of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is likely to maintain the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to repress opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 13,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state must also can be read in the project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote its moral and its values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, it is simply censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantee equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead of it, another article forbidden to offend or defame the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> On the other hand, the article does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are subject to interpretation in the project that will submit to the vote, which, in his own words, will &quot;very soon&quot; the subject of a referendum among Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution from&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition rallies for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down Sharia law before it enters into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is rising and we are going to win,&quot; says Hamdin Nasserist Hamadin Sabahi, who came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is &quot;to throw in the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of trying to foment a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow,&quot; exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purged,&quot; said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, has called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;The people call for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;It cleans our country!,&quot; asked, saying that &quot;the Koran was their] Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place, where it all began, would have quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, that&apos;s what the supporters wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The Islamists&apos; project certainly will win the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned once.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which should have been extended until February and encompass all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Counsel for Human Rights 48 years old and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he shared their conception of the world, but because human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> That is why he was subjected to beatings, tried and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution,&quot; he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of the three powers has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy, and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president makes it de facto all its powers,&quot; says Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, a democracy cannot function without organisations of civil society. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> It could afford. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protester on the spot warns: &quot;You family of a monster that you will not be possible to control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The Norwegian rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway are one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the country&apos;s success could be linked to the local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take advanced cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a pile of football wet and dirty clothes. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled salt and fermented in water for a period - depending on the smell that you want it - which can go up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness settles and that it is cold, the Norwegians gather in droves to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,&quot; said Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full-time, the so-called &quot;rakfisk General&quot; responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and don a large amount of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer aquavit to the rakfisk,&quot; said Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid getting under your nose, it is not bad - it sounds like a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water in the air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once fermented fish came out - and undoubtedly undermined by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals whose country there is not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, from Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This makes use of the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost $10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not for him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about the killing, they talk about &quot;the incident on 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 1970s, Norway has its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, the blond hair and a blue numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plateau of rakfisk in hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how can you say - prudent people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like most people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not like to point out. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution, except for a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries threw money through the windows, over the years that have led to the financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep it tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as you can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,&quot; said Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk,&quot; she adds in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger consisting of momentum, a real discovery is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where there is rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It is like the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What have you given to the best fish in the mountains Thor - Juergen&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;This is our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> You hear laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto has experienced a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, addresses the difficulties that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is well, the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very crowded and sprawling gripping the capital, on his land of choice, views on this new leader are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Locals attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr. Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once deep and full of cracks. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plaques bearing his name hanging outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to implement lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope a real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It&apos;s a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the autoponts highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the military has been called to the rescue in the fight against drug gangs that are rampant in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone, was found on the edge of landfill, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back tears when she shows pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of a suicide by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,&quot; said the Lady Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigidity grafts had already begun. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana covered the wall, beside a cross containing the word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is exactly what the family has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> I have been treated as if I were an old gossipy, a hero of disorder, a pleurnicheuse. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he would make his priority during his term. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it will be as good as president when he was governor,&quot; said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, say prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning would have been a victim during detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning took place in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the case be closed because it was done in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were subsequently published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the hearing Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had met after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum appendages from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Officers have asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke about the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment of his guards was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had been in the prison was generally &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms showed no complaints of abuse, although officers have directly questioned about his prison treatment, said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said he had orally expressed concerns about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not documented the problems. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They have written&quot; no problem &quot; (after having addressed the concerns), and this does not mean that I did not raise any problems,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a &quot;risk of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level under close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to withdraw this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life, from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the U.S. Marines at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he had contemplated suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted again because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact of not having been kept abreast of what he was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon in the cage,&quot; said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only objects available were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay open during the day was contrary to the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woken up in order to be able to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Counsel for Manning filed a formal complaint for the treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- after being forced to sleep overnight in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to be covered with a blanket during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the judge&apos;s questions Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to drop coverage, which would have been able to conceal her nudity, but he acknowledged that no one ordered him to surrender. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences during his detention and that it will greatly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted by court martial, a trial should be held in early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense said that Manning plans to plead guilty of less serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all charges are retained, he could face imprisonment for life. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identity crisis Mexico-U.S. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette said that Mexico and the United States are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two ways: one for the &quot; &quot; (&quot; Mexicans &quot;), another &quot; (&quot; Strangers &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what put me. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I was called the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is an ethnic epithet, in the same way as the one that my friends in Boston are when they say &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York when they say &quot;Italian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then I became &quot;Mexico City American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land that saw my grandfather, no need for a special word or hyphen. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in either language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native, and I can&apos;t lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and I headed to the &quot;Strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their territory at the tip of the gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, as soon as an official US formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma are seeking the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with more than 35 million Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want to address the issue of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, one person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most often, this person was a typical profile -- a dark-skinned, educated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we are living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We are in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class, we do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them a humiliating defeat and we stand beside as if we were inferior and not enough Mexican strain. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be quite good, our relationship with Mexico will never be quite strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families did not fail when they lived in Mexico, they would never be gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would be stuck on the right side of the barrier, comfortably living in the United States, but as lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, I am reminded that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans, Mexicans strongly assert their identity and Mexico City - Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although US citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> On the other hand, many Mexico City - Americans that I know do not appear to be part of one country or another. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are regarded as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are regarded as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate the relationship, as I have learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico City - Americans work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a wonderful country we must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, considering the wage inequality, corruption and violence linked to the drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You will have to fend for themselves, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It&apos;s normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they have treated Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico City - Americans always want how family members were treated there is not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> We may be more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will never be a lasting peace between the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another blood seems to indicate that such hope is futile. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While there are still the same futile argument about who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s largest city, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab spring is breaking up, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Maybe their struggle will escalate further. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there is every reason to believe that it could help them to get out of this deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser and no winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of the strength of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has suffered a beating. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Killing some of its leaders and expelled the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has been rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a booming regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, took for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Members of Hamas are and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where Hezbollah exercises its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar al-Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, a despot who has ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are relying more easily to the public. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player who will not be ruled out by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been called into box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The interceptor missile system known as Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly at night - for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rocket attacks from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, notably through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in respect of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose party two-state merged with an even more hawkish party leader Avigdor Lieberman in the runup to the election on 22 January, was the beautiful part. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why there&apos;s Palestinian state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they were running the West Bank, do not launch rockets, as their countrymen have done in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hit them as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but it may be that the Arab spring is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists take power in Egypt and elsewhere like Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> He has worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think about the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need to be pushed by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is advocated by reasonable people from each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now try to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the next proposal for a state to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama has also any interest in what Israel has agreed to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is a very narrow view. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This involves a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws for neutral packages of cigarettes came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and pictures of sick bodies cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most stringent regime in the world in terms of tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government said that the aim was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any glamour representation. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that they will never start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by tobacco companies through their brand image,&quot; said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown that children associate the crown of a logo for a princess. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies have said that it would boost trade in the black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The negative consequences of this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have said that this law boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, such as silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has increased significantly, there are two months since British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you are working in the tobacco marketing and that you don&apos;t have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place of excellence,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of the marks on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and bother to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulations in place rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar legislation on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning photos on the packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these pictures. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos don&apos;t bother. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you screwing the package,&quot; said Victor El Hage when buying a package containing a photograph of the mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason I will stop, this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the tobacconist Pack&quot; in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I needed an hour to unload a package now, I need four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to prohibit once and for all, and we would have said OK, it&apos;s good, you stop and you put the key under the door,&quot; he added, by lifting the arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> As a result, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in the child&apos;s development are praising boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This would force the brain to borrow interesting paths, or even to feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as for the most part, we are constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So should we embrace boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First, like a lot of people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, &quot;said Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of&quot; Boredom: Lively History &quot; (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The problem goes back very far,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii are graffiti depicting boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then there is the definition we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After going through numerous publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified boredom as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but not to engage in a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task that she would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a gloomy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or the world, while those who believe that the problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we sometimes think that we&apos;re bored when it is actually a matter of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> As part of their study, &quot;the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard from the room beside her too much of a TV show who had no connection, others have just heard the TV, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level said they were annoyed that the two other groups - they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to focus on a difficult task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you make a boring task, &quot;like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you don&apos;t get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, now we know that when you are wiggles or scrawls, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to space to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay quiet,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all bored one day or another - the delay in my flight, a speaker with a voice lacking in sparkle, a particularly boring film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;scale of susceptibility to boredom&quot; in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes statements such as, &quot;one of the tasks that are performed, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many centres of interest that I don&apos;t have time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, adolescents are quickly blase. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32% of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their duties at home, while 23% said they feel bored when they were not at school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3% of parents reported being bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of today&apos;s boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level,&quot; particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I based my question: boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boredom is the way that the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, you will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, you will be happy in the short-term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it gets lonely, but he has not learned to deal with alone or autorégler, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;This autorèglement move from a situation to another,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to entertain, he gets more control of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we should glorify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think we should criticise. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable outside the constant ferment that generate business and technology is the goal to which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to annoy us more often, but boredom evokes an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the downtime. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés,&quot; he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, has been indicted for something that will become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that can be used for minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use is more dependent on the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been closed. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have ceased to charge adults 21 years or more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts in Colorado have called to speed up the existing cases of marijuana and continue to prosecute those who have. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains now vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the state in their neighbourhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what lies ahead,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in the state of Washington are also quite a few questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are seeking guidance on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in the area of regulation on marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes, and now in relation to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, which is called 502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of a year, during which the system will not exist yet, while the possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees an adequate access to marijuana approved and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis within a radius of 30 kilometers around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no more difficult than urban areas to install an approved trade sale of cannabis, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legalisation of cannabis, a research group formed recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, Aurora, sent an Email to his officers announcing that the &quot;attorney City&quot; (representing the public prosecutor) no longer would pursue those 21 years and older who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop charging people for this type of crime &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Weld County, in northern Colorado, the &quot;district attorney&quot; (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to pressure on users to wean. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 people have been charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has an obligation to take legal action against those persons who have committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was an offence recognised,&quot; said Mr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer scheduled to appear in adults for possession of limited quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to drop all cases of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, providing a legal framework and appropriate government for the personal use of marijuana is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various US cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier&quot; with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (&quot; national organization to reform laws on marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, too, have difficulty in accepting that it is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to deal with the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and representatives of the state are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they are waiting with concern the directives of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has enabled businesses of marijuana for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police will probably not break down the doors to seize small packets of drugs, it is likely that it opposes licensed outlets of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoria on the creation of new businesses selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year postponement. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> A lot of questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not just today&apos;s students who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother have studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a sort of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to do my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of the Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room beside mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. Wilson said with quirk that I was having been forced to drink in chipped cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled because I had been a victim of intimidation and has been the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in the cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was a victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very good idea influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why talk about it today, you might say. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students will suffer the same kind of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were &quot;often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want there to be a representative in the university&apos;s Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;the country wonders: young, Intelligent and Right&quot;), dedicated to the policy among students, and portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA),&quot; which travels by Rolls-Royce, wears a full silver and travels with a cane chrome head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the increase in tuition fees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, &quot;said in a Sunday newspaper&quot; that there is a bias left growing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have met.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR to the people who are centre-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the wellbeing of its members,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think during my first weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a paralysing shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the earliest days of the host week, when new students came with others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that teachers not only participated in the taunts to Tory students, but that they were taking pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy on minor strikers, privatization and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of the classroom. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm that I experienced was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I wasn&apos;t prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost my footing. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man in the face pustular, won easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Do the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears burned the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I would suggest that you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends,&quot; he launched a vicious tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner this evening, I sat alone and then I felt a slight pat on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in the second year of study in English, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said, politely. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that this happens. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is being targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It&apos;s already pretty hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I shamefully tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that had told Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This ploy failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students echoed the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Tories do they love?&quot; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, isn&apos;t it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> I would have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> I would have had to become Labour and deny my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only openly Tory teacher was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was an adviser in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place and insignificant, as well as its accession to the Marxist point of view - deterministic of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You are not happy here,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started commuting between Oxford and my parents&apos; house in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends who live more open-minded. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They wouldn&apos;t do it, not in the city to the dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends had impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Leaves them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is to tease you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would break the heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and waived his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a session of tutor-supported the following week, when another professor of history suggested the more seriously in the world, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Blushed with shame, I admitted being a victim of the brain washing my parents and the traitai &quot;old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who drove the final nail in my oxfordien coffin. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my rivals dropped out. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never went back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me chicken pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no child under 18 years of age should be a victim of such intimidation in a school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also enjoys a strong reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers the elegance to fame&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: a Master of Couture,&quot; which opened this week in London, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer acknowledged at the opening of &quot;Valentino: a Master of Couture,&quot; a prestigious retrospective, which brings together more than 130 models couture created for his couture house over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this palace,&quot; he said with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;signore&quot; Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March next year, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino is displaying memorabilia such as trophies of his ascension: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the jet set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong with people like royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least, they do not crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some stars of pop music,&quot; said Baroness Fiona. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all worship be invited in his Gstaad chalet,&quot; explains the former wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, close friend of beauty of the time spent as a Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to fame. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, each guest was important and appreciated,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; which began working with him during the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;It will never be acceptable, because his creations are works of art,&quot; end says. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Line of nobility parade </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but shared love. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves people and with the greatest titles and also love. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and paraded on the podium to see a &quot;public&quot; dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the suit chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that was Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among the public models include names like Sybille Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a trousers, a shirt, a &quot;gillette&quot; jacket and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection in 1971-72. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a gift that I had done,&quot; said Naty Abascal, one of the designer&apos;s muses. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer to all the others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it enhances our beauty,&quot; said the former Duchess of Feria&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colours he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and Patricia modeuse Giovampaola della cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward Line. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red party dress with a skirt, a draped bra and a bra to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Rodrigue. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,&quot; said the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess retains the designer&apos;s evening dresses with &quot;the utmost care, because an evening gown is not just a dress, it is also all the memories it conveys.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The final major exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the designer calls and seamstresses) to carry out this ivory silk gown with pearl inlays, 12 different kinds of lace and a long tail of four metres and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress represents a historical fact of fashion from the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of clients of the high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the &quot;skills&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani earns as much as any spouse of his clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;Its elegance, its quiet, neat and perfect I have always been glaringly obvious,&quot; acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw it was a month at a gala dinner at the Musée d&apos;Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was perfect, the years have no effect on him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it&apos;s a princess who says... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 kilograms of sulphur through the steep stone trails. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living in the Ijen Kawah volcano, in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth hardens in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having collected large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilograms, he installed in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the steep trails. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and not stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a mistake could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur extract. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once they find their way between the tourists who photograph as if they were circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little down to everyone metres of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> These are PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and you can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It sells to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, since it is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to launder sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we haul about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; says Anto, who usually performs three trips per day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Everyone takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would do well in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; said the bearer who once worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (EUR 6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have returned to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At 27 years, he has spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though it covers the face with a mask and wearing special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work even two years ago, because I want to open a shop or study French or Spanish&quot; promises in an English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of this, it is the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a wooden hovel unsafe with other carriers, rises every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because sulfur does not always happen at night, when his yellow became blue and shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying darkness, Anto descends into the crater with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 carriers load sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its comfortable profits, the company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide equipment to carriers who are working on their own account and are paid to the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In addition, they do not affect a 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is done for the animals, not for humans,&quot; protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old stout porter who works at Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, it ensures that he will not stop working &quot; as long as he can, because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulphur can damage the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious illnesses... plus of course their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53-year-old, can only carry 50 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and fellow troops extract 15 tonnes of sulfur from the volcano, three trucks at the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 miles away from a goat path overgrown with weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life,&quot; said Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a bearer of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore seeks babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans cast responsibility for this lack of children on their careers, stress and the cost of access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore must be developed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, are fulfilling our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as &quot;will be open in the drawer&quot; to make a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in an entertaining way through this advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people meet their national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we have been able to make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a theme that we had to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to concentrate or organize speed-dating evenings. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we said the following: what&apos;s more creative to solve this problem than a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The Government of Singapore does not take lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1,300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers pays up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city-state rich and high-tech southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time he found himself above 2, considered the rate of renewal, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of the marriage and the family of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the establishment of a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delaying marriage and births, which result in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> In the meantime, an immigration policy designed to drastically increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites that is a thinly disguised against new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are accused of pulling down wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has seen last year its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the implementation of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unanticipated consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;box of shoes,&quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale has won a lot of success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers who want to build large family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its &quot;boxes&quot; are much faster than larger dwellings. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much more quickly than those of larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who have previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, that&apos;s why people until later,&quot; said a young man. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,&quot; says another young twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, they are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private offline is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sector or &quot;private life that we can protect them from any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What does - which is the responsibility of the private sector for less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Does he understand the dangers to himself by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he would not be offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the web. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they were associated with the term &quot;something very personal&quot; and &quot;the password and user name&quot; when they have applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I&apos;m not going my most personal secrets in a post,&quot; said Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account over the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very confidential, but not my mother can know everyone,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> I post pictures or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discussed with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I do not share one of my photos or someone who would be the fool,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 FB friends, as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they say, I just position,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He says he will never accept the demand for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He will not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of José, 14, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on the latter, he admitted that he did not know about 20 persons on his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, no one has made advances nor asked her address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they gave me the pressure or demanded, I just supprimerais my account,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that are now known as cyberstalking are not alien to the young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A close friend of one of my friends was extorted money from a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They have threatened and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;It has only happened in private profile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait pictures of knowledge in awkward or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would if I were angry or upset. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know that it is cyberstalking,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a professor of English and Licensee Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras says Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in education from the University of Yale and author of the book &quot;digital natives and immigrants,&quot; uses those words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives, children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, we are digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are learning,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He added that the issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should be or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We ask them to be selective when what is most important is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers confidentiality is to use issues that make us think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so is useless,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you don&apos;t raconterais to a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or would you like to have that they publish a picture of you as a friend you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identified pictures of celebrations, requests you to other people permission to identify? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everybody needs to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be on social networks,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and counselor education, says that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions for the use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> With each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the seven party representatives. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency said at the outset that it would be disclosed after the close of the summit, and said it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information about the summit has consistently been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message &quot;private session, audio restricted&quot; was published in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among the journalists were those given by the press of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an Email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In October last year, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Summit - Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been asked by the press body, it did not broadcast the statement called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, you can verify that the document was published in the month of March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague that a different border between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of both parties in the trial that Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and fulfil the verdict that will solve the disputes we have today before the international court,&quot; said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international tribunals,&quot; said President Piñera by shaking hands with President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundary with Nicaragua it considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was asked to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the summit would &quot;important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He was informed that action would be put in place to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;economic consolidation (Latin America) must not be complacent but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples,&quot; concluded President Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... by uniting our countries and generating new economic channels,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the cross-cutting areas of its territory, from the coast in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give more details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbours, is another issue at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to review all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which will seek to have a discussion with this country,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,&quot; said the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the power of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the context of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet first to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn how to integrate citizenship,&quot; said Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which &quot;South America, in this case, was to take on Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told the state TV, Péru TV, that Europeans &quot;were killing each other during the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but that they were now almost a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the proposal to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member nations of Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, the Ecuadorian President has been in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the United States and take into account the Pact of San José on Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who have bombarded us never compromise anything, on the other hand, we have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington in the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador in the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa maintains that he did not regret his decision because he did not himself betrayed its principles, but he instead met its &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that at the time, &quot;there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice that demanded that it comply on its territory for interrogation about a sexual offence then assumed that &quot;the Swedish legislation allows us to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the physical and mental health deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being locked up in a small area without being able to exercise outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This is about the health of anyone,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa noted that the solution asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a permit that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures from various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thinks that &quot;if Britain gave the pass tomorrow, it would end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Ecuador Embassy in London, or Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that it will not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies that are harmful to freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, it welcomed the fact that it is not this kind of journalists &quot;neither bankers nor the hegemonic country and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than put forward his re-election, &quot;it would deepen the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency &quot;should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup disguised&quot; because in reality, &quot;it would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the time being, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It must be solved in their entirety to overcome and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said that it is &quot;beneficial that Latin America must seize the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so strong that it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this opportunity &quot;with a great deal of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured him that if he lost the primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I have never had interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty cannot be solved by means of political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that it was me who would guarantee this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last presidential term, and I then will retire from politics. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will do as well. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chávez,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the result of the test: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen on the head,&quot; he said, referring to the time of the announcement that the doctor had tried to make it &quot;less painful&quot; in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid with his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take one of his illness and began to learn about him and his persistence was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye to him &quot;because he was speechless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of a patient starting treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectious disease specialist and an expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of 200 men and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive an HIV diagnosis for 25 years, &quot;as long as it remains under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; said the scientist asked. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to put this progress in its context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of the Mexican is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has risen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Just in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we will ensure that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why are there any deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That&apos;s how I see it, that&apos;s what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they are learning to advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is making earlier diagnosis, and for that, we should offer screening tests to all those who request it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the Council of State AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has to do its testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffered from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think they are going to die and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am going to die, it is better than I was three times a week,&quot; they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> So far, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, just like anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but colead, I am careful to me and the other person,&quot; said Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with Milenio Jalisco, thanks to his testimony, to help those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day Against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, are responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places dedicated to this, &quot;it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we packages of 100, that&apos;s very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;What do you do?&quot; asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at counters, but distributors of public toilets and in places that are frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not to pay their girls and the motel, said Governor Emilio González when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It&apos;s not like this that works sexuality, it is better to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Jalisco figures </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and HIV 1,320 Serviced). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is the fourth state of the country in the number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in the number of HIV patients. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of all HIV infections are through sexual contact, 6% and 2%. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because in each case, there are four or five people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgment call by a US court ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a negative precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and having solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the Stripes, opposite view of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargo on their properties beyond Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow Mexico&apos;s largest glass manufacturer to capture the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge in the case noted that the creditors will have to register under the law on bankruptcy in the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would be to denounce the international cooperation procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies having a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the law of the United Nations for the shortest of the International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, the Swiss Federal Institute of Faillites had guaranteed the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> In addition, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is the &quot;vulture&quot; funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergència, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have won the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A given omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he met since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis which the United States, spreading costs in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the time being, the company of family González Sada file an appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote in its entirety, with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance will not prosper and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;) in which detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, noting that the freeing of the agreements signed by the two countries to the same level as paragraph 15 of the Law on the bankruptcy of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, he noted that the country has complied with the principles of the UN Commission on International Trade, the rules for cross-border insolvencies, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pileup of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> Overview </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Complaints from unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of Aviateurs Drivers has already encountered problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Morineau Chávez, has just presented a criminal inquiry against the National Banking Commission and the Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied that it provides information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos in the name of the Mexicana de Aviación. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Authority. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As we all know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> They besiege the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Meeting at the end of the week in an auditorium at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of the Great Wall, with an area of housing for employees of 150 companies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> ACTA died </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico&apos;s ambassador to Japan had signed the Agreement Commercial anti-counterfeiting, known by its French acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As everyone knows, it&apos;s clear that the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Long term Homex </seg>
<seg id="2862"> In order to pay long-term debts without affecting those in the short term, the property developer Homex was launched on the market in the stock market for 500 million pesos. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The issuance of securities is the first of the four programs for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> Birth of Competival </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Integrated by the NYCE company, Quálity and Kernet, leaders of the computer, a new consortium to name Competival is born, whose goal is the market for software services in Central America and the South. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Investments in this area are more than 1.5 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> &quot;Hetin&quot; Hector Reyes &quot;basketball is all my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotting basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the land and, thanks to him, has traveled worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as great as &quot;Hetin&quot; Hector Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the OBS, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more in the same time, as when I was president of the OBS, Director General of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s,&quot; recalls Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is all my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes did not exaggerate when he made this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memories that recall his unconventional route, show. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In the heart Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who recall him as a player within the team of Vaqueros in the mid 1950s until 1982, after 15 years as a manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;This has been my best years, I have benefited most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, either as manager, manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championship matches from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrew championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From here, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the helm of the team, &quot; said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a big player for you, two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then advised me Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of the best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He welcomed the championship Vaqueros with Gausse, but only distance since in 1988 he was already the big brother of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his expenses and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we have won for the first time in the United States during the tournament pre-Olympic in Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game,&quot; said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team for you? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favourite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold, and that we have put a beating on the US team, which was quite similar to the one who had won the bronze medal at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), there were also young (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-Olympic Neuquen in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacement players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Undoubtedly, it&apos;s Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level, as did Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in the various leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It&apos;s very hard to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In young people, I love the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest success within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the OBS had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that boys Pontius only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people are travelling and playing too, even though it is not necessarily necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I have seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, the field staff and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I would like to take the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, has been universally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as JR in the television series &quot;Dallas,&quot; in which he was a businessman unscrupulous, ruthless and manipulative. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, the role of oil tycoon unscrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J R in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., home production of &quot;Dallas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing ironic that he loved the most,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas on the holiday of Thanksgiving. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who was performing the role of his wife in the original series and later was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and he will miss me. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional person and he lived life,&quot; said Gray in a news release. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Doctors had diagnosed with liver cirrhosis Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted having a drink for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he had undergone a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman had been known to television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams,&quot; broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he walked back home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He has also played in two comedies that have remained little time for the antenna, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here we Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his roles in the films, there are roles well received by the critics in &quot;the group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously evil J.R. that Larry Hagman had its greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been released from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;who shot J.R.?,&quot; invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars in bets. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record audience at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers averaged in front of their screen and made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had attracted 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. was pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people were also reasons for the attack. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and greedy man, but the charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to commit his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what it would take as an epitaph for J r,&quot; said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> You should write: &quot;Ci-gît honest citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only party that he has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, who cohosted the original series, was recalled Friday Hagman as a &quot;great man, both on the small screen and in life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the chance to know and love. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is under construction, told the channel. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the moment, neither Warner nor the TNT channel reported on the way will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who enjoyed fame with classic works such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to counsel Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It was there that he met the young interior designer Swedish Maj Axelsson and he has married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he has titled his memoirs &quot;Hello: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot; (in French: Hello: the ruthless memories of J. R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I have nothing written in this book that can hurt or affect any way whatsoever,&quot; he said to the press at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active campaigner for organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help patients worried. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advise, I gives them confidence, I am with them when they come to do it,&quot; he said in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I am trying to offer them a bit of comfort, such as &quot;don&apos;t be afraid, it won&apos;t be easy for a small moment, but it will go well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course dealing with the &quot;end of the world&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, viruses and germs and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;count&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as proof of the end of the world imminent. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expected over the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed &quot; the Armageddon of debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists thought that would trigger the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that it was going to be the most apocalyptic six months I&apos;ve ever experienced,&quot; said this week Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers University, Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we racontions, it was a very good time. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only professor to give courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Temple, the Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the &quot;media, culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, viruses and germs and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We look at this because these ideas are proliferating with time,&quot; he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with examples of real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed to give a course, simply titled &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We are adding&quot; 2012 &quot;to have the opportunity to give the course again, in the event that the world does not would go away,&quot; said Professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;disaster,&quot; students must study, develop projects and spend their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give student choice but to work &quot;until the night of the end of the world,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The course proved to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was complete in two hours,&quot; said Restall about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received Email several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the proportion of people who asked if there was still room. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University, Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and sickbay of 25 years, says he has watched all the apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this matter,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us believe in the date of the end of the world of 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,&quot; said Julie zegle, a student last year at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I admit that there is a fear about the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a rise in such speculation. </seg>
