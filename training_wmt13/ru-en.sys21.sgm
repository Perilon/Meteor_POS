<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance of Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies to combat spin in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the native believe the myth, arguing that the cases of electoral fraud in the United States more rare than deaths from a lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By the same token Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States over the last ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing you can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Therefore most state governments since 2009 adopt laws, усложняющие voting or the registration process. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result only one 2011 was taken by 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 state. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, упраздняют voter registration on the day of voting rights and are eligible to vote for citizens who have a prior conviction. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state, which imposed a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years they have bills, forcing voters to present a photo ID, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11 percent of the American people, that is, the 21 million people under age, do not have identity cards, needed to vote with the government agency issued a photograph of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds $100. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 15 percent, 25 percent African American men, зарабатывающих from 18 to 29 years of less than $35,000, 18 percent of the population over the age of 65 and 20 percent of voters do not have the required ID photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that&apos;s not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students - voters, who are supposed to vote for candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID, issued their educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of hunting and fishing clubs who vote for Republicans used mainly for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004 no staff demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Beginning in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, obviously, aim to limit voting Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers raised in 2011 упраздняющие registration of voters on election day, the laws in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction was not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make the lists nearly 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures ranging from 17% in 2009, led to a fall in the level of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting in five other states. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 election in Florida 33 percent of voters, exit ahead of schedule, were --, although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters across the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with people from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike the whites, forming 76% of voters, among vote ahead of schedule was only 46 percent. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters vigorously oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration drives. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws were ветировано governors Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most ambiguous laws was suspended for intervention by the attorney general of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has partly to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws, requiring a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules, joined in the action, of course, will implement the voting rights in the 2012 elections. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction in order to influence the 2012 election results in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The center&apos;s report native from 2011 shows that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, a PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, sometimes and лжепозитивные that cause бесполезному medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, is from which hesitate even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two experts opinion. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The research, conducted in the United States, experienced numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any specific recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European, found a different level of mortality in those patients who underwent screening, and those who don&apos;t walk him. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed that, after a 12-year-old observation, the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40 percent higher than those who had not passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting with 40 or 50 years, if one direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of African origin also are at an increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The cancer can be as aggressive, as well as вялотекущим. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient must clarify the extent of his cancer risk of the disease, offering him options, without the mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, while making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men, have detected the cancer will not undergo a course of treatment for their cancers are aggressive and does not represent a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer them an active surveillance, and if we start treatment, the disease will progress. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we with precision define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it also consult with your doctor to determine whether to pass the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, мовембер created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (as in English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is not a miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Is that if all the people well fed and quite moving, 30% рако cases could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, this figure rose to at least 50 percent,&quot; said Andre meetings, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, an estimated 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused наследственностью. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer are totally unaccountable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer-fighting smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85 percent of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is doing immense harm to public health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today in Quebec has 1.5 million smokers,&quot; says spokesman Andre meetings. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The encouraging fact: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, Tolstoy and colon, esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; adds to the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The association also recommends limiting intake of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausage products also should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;recent can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explain the association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists engaged in the study of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But for the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called straight. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, study of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In the assessment of influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr. больё stresses that their anxiety and family history information important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Бозон Higgs in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer a message about the fact that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs бозон, caused a fuss - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this бозон explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, he said, is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or, in any event, &quot;the least imperfect descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, but which have not been found experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physics is not yet fully convinced that it is concerned about бозоне Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles бозон Higgs predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data, presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, though for the full confidence of some of the data still lacks. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same that talking about бозоне Higgs, as well as a chance to make a mistake seem minimal, and let&apos;s see what this means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> One law is, in this world is inevitable, said that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule, there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;квантовом condition&quot; is a &quot;condition&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> As a result, physicists share particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find good citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the principle Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> On the other hand by бозоны, гнусная gang anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle that means that they might be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the Web site (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley Lab, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: мезоны, about which we will not mention here, &quot;particles and forces,&quot; through which apply the basic forces of nature and to which in some ways is бозон Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all exotic creatures such as you would think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this chronicle, this one by one incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or &quot;Baath&quot; of light, which is a &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic forces. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when a particle with an electric charge, accelerates or changes of direction, this &quot;violates&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone, brought in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violations&quot; born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a фотоном - and, therefore, one бозонов &quot;vectors&quot; forces. </seg>
<seg id="123"> The more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same thing happens with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this бозон appeared, should be &quot;disrupted&quot; the Higgs field, another field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to rouse him, to achieve very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That&apos;s why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated in CERN&apos;s Large адронный коллайдер, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! &quot;to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field is also to explain the relationship between бозоном Higgs and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all of the materials and not all particles interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) didn&apos;t have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, as a &quot;can do&quot; all these studies, asked Ms. пламондон? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts cm. </seg>
<seg id="133"> At the same time some of them passionately crave, to reappear this divergence, T. K. slightest discrepancy could open the door for a &quot;New Physics&quot; and plug some holes model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, you have to say, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which produces about 80 percent of the universe (ouch-ouch!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while the CERN found no such differences. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it isn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Watch: in the early 1960s pioneers laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They envisioned their applications in science, but not more than that. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he has developed the first continuous laser (previous were momentum) in 1962, said that initially the laser was more like &quot;gadget lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And, moreover, can have an application for tools, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969 has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; in digital cameras everywhere in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question at the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should soon resume, but at this time is the bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Yet in this crucial area remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;debt&quot; to look closer to home. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago Mr L. Still lived alone in his apartment in монтережи. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, his разрушавший inside, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;gave me five years, I lived seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the orphanage in palliative care Victor гадбуа белёй, which came on the eve of the visit. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, for it is impossible to prepare,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet, and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at a table, on which stands аппетитный lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him take food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He бодрится, even manages smile, talk with strangers, which employs around him, bring him drugs, do it in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in front of the usual death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest wish that cured me from diarrhea, it&apos;s humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found the drug from this malaise. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;For the life of US taught that a man must urinate standing up,&quot; said Pierre-Victor гадбуа Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the status of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on a person&apos;s ability to tolerate the decline, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who arrive in palliative Victor гадбуа shelter, all have cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts see them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called &quot;therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to learn of their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I&apos;ve got good kids,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I don&apos;t want anything else in life,&quot; she says, before allowing put her mask, developing breathing. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting for his son&apos;s last visit in the coming days, recruited from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> At the orphanage гадбуа Victor with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which remains that nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11 700 residents accounted for one seat in palliative care institutions. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian an orphanage - one of the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we accept provide ротовые wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics we no longer force to control sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought beer Mr. X, who died today in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son допил this beer in the legs of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are close, as well as patients,&quot; says Natalie Savar, director of nursing care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At the orphanage Victor-гадбуа no day is similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on their подушках during a toast in his honor, 36 years young man dies tragically, surrounded by his wife and two small children, parents and перепробоваший everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients in 45 years of age,&quot; a doctor says Christian an. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken in an orphanage гадбуа Victor, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> Is that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided, to alleviate the suffering of the sick, included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home or in a hospital or at the orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as Victor гадбуа shelter and the Society of palliative care at home, the big Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Is this a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors - palliative care specialists fear the new law, легализирующего the assistance and help with suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by beacons in palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and so-called for their disagreement with this initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christian an, Quebec&apos;s health-care system is not effective enough, to provide high-quality palliative care on the right before the transition will be allowed to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, &quot;I saw пациентку, who spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients are willing to die only because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my онкологу that I stop treatment, she told me that she regrets that I stop the fight, &quot;said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> At the same time, she told herself to me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Care is not all-powerful </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. an believes that 90 percent of patients who ask about death, thanks to medical staff, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with the pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to элси Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home, the big Montreal patients not receptive to обезболиванию in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> In the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> No more pretending that we don&apos;t know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I wish I had the assistance,&quot; meaning &quot;I want me to become easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible by a journalist grant from the Research Institute of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The real estate with large-scale scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of political parties and experts of the Italian mafia day by day tell what they know about the system, &quot;colossal&quot; опутывающей construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the gangsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;The industry, which is very expensive cost taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;Curiously, the way the system after all the funds were put in it, Jacques дюшено joked, a lawmaker and former Montreal police chief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is due to him in 2011 scandal as a result of the investigation of crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, to which the prime minister at the time of the liberals, Jean balloon, agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;The report дюшено&quot; established a direct link between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one of the Ministry of Transport would have retained a billion dollars in contracts,&quot; if some withheld their instincts take share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The commission шарбонно &quot;already сместила two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that she could &quot;open the scheme behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> The permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The case had created a permanent division in 2011 on the fight against corruption, which entered a state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>

<seg id="227"> The latter detonated a bomb, after the investigation of the &quot;system&quot; of government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Within a few years замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, a facilitator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, his party mayor жеральда трамбле money &quot;joint Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000-s замбито сорил money foolishly. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to various parties across the province, mostly liberals, who then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that illegally collected funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie нормандо. </seg>

<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received the bribe, завышая account for 30-40% using bogus additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one of the organizer of the party&apos;s mayor, Martan дюмон, accused Mr трамбле in the fact that he deliberately closed his eyes to the existence of parallel budget, наполнявшего party till dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations Mr трамбле resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis. </seg>

<seg id="243"> As we убираемся at home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques дюшено notices for his part that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but especially his worry about the role of the &quot;elected officials knew about the scheme, but is not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the share of dirty money to finance the re-election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: &quot;Until we strictly limit elective spending, in politics are dirty money.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="250"> &quot;псж - not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you in псж achieved extraordinary scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and the new measurement псж. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profit great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Beside them I расту every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also brought a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during a match, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t распаляюсь. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the very beginning in the center of the provisional training in клерфонтене ниф and prior to my arrival in Saint Etienne I always strode forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you take the benefits of competition, by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Renewing this summer is not a novelty play matches a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> As a result, that a player like me, wants to be at the same level as well as best as possible. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti assists in my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Substitutes such as Claude макелеле, who played in the same position as I help him. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the master of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspire respect the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in the league and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I went from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust, which he supports me, also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season псж? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the first league leader Lyon took place in us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Champions League is one of our main goals: we spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We&apos;ll go as fast as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now everyone can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We can say their word face to face with very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group, in front of the Porto, in order to be able to accept the return match in one in eight of the final. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether псж become excellent European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already has a budget for this... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate positions in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially псж have the funds to make the project viable. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Don&apos;t take the title in the league, as last season, will be a huge flop? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we operate fervently wish to win the crown. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, was a disappointment, because we had everything to reach the finals for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Earlier this year, I think everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux joined in the fight for the title, I think that we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> If you don&apos;t think that the media can expect too much from псж? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It&apos;s normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have the players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared for this. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what раскритиковать, of course, it&apos;s a little bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder, what people expect from us in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We&apos;re not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to introduce a draft of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We proved in the Champions League that can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons can&apos;t go in one-eighth finals, although they also spent huge money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount invested, we have presented by 15 points ahead by winter перерыву. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be a dereliction of our opponents and the French championship. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; this new псж. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that how увлекательна first league. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can smile and say to yourself that, as a result, despite all the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Псж seem entirely depends on the deeds Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So what if, say that there is a kind of &quot;златанозависимость. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this and he proves that he is the star of the first league. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a star on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done, it really exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others to improve his game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Тьяго Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have Euro-2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I earnestly wanted to participate in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw many things there, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Now I can play good qualification matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first months Didier дешама led blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They are effective for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the group selection for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He was a coach, he is close to the players and inspiration for victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I wouldn&apos;t want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified us in euros. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier дешам lead Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good-draw (1-1), вырванная on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of the banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the numbered центробанках transactions between the converse parties C комиссионными levies on their treatment. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented сатоши накамото (a pseudonym), at the same time, a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure the exchange on the type of BitTorrent protocol, which allows the exchange of files between members of the same level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course биткойна, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011., five months later fell to $2, before return today by about ten dollars (courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) a virtual currency in his report, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes биткойн as &quot;the most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as the &quot;credits&quot; used to advance in a video game, which earned during the game or who might buy (and sometimes and exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the operation of exchange controls and processes any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In all parts of the network биткойн are simultaneously holders accounting books, auditors, issuers of currency, покупателыми and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How is this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each deal between two users actually happening between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction, signed electronically, using encryption system with the double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> The contents of the file, it is possible to verify that биткойны used in the deal, the book does exist in public accounting, разосланной across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The registration of the new transaction is a key step in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> She passes through the mathematical tasks, разосланной computers, decided that, as a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Speaking of the phase hashing file, that is, the transformation of a large file in a digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> &quot;computers take&quot; new transaction and add to her room, before &quot;хэшировать all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number, which gives a digital signature (many zeros in the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as the number found, other sites to check that it properly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction thus finds нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished would pay twice in one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed the network - and the other remained unproved, because they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, set a task, receives 50 биткойнов. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid a reward on a regular basis, inflation is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number биткойнов in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by стомиллионной one that leaves another reserve... </seg>
<seg id="380"> Also, the complexity of the task grows with the increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has experienced ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The sites, providing services Bitcoin, were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The defect does not apply to the protocol,&quot; says Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - the company been paid real money using Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also told about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the money also have the disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as WordPress blog platform, let them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently дорит Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed accounting book and found that almost 80% биткойнов not are in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;giant sales were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty-thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; rejoice Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which manages конвертацией биткойнов into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Another author, Pierre нуаза allowances for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a network operating. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or advantage payment via mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to check transactions, thereby getting cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> A better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Just enough to address, which can &quot;see and photograph&quot; phone, clarifies Pierre нуаза, reassuring that there are already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before the Bitcoin settles itself, will take place for some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to a variety of risks, considered today elevated, in the case of the system&apos;s success. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the United States of supermarkets and fast workers go on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Through his work at McDonald&apos;s hand goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days in America a ride the wave of protests against low wages at a Walmart in department stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, &quot;Bell,&quot; &quot;tacos уэндис&quot; and &quot;Kentucky into the чикен.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one is predicting, into whether this surge in the ninth wave or she is destined to expire in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The shares are supporting the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> But the modest increase in wages, which are ordinary workers Walmart and fast-food systems, the major tour organisers of protests is the establishment of trade union organizations in them. </seg>
<seg id="728"> As long as this sector of the economy barely covered the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America crumbled orgy cheap sales, annexed by millions of consumers and sometimes сопровождавшаяся потасовками. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some workers at a Walmart, in which around the world are 2.2 million people have left their jobs, and together with the trade unions and left-wing activists picketed Stores Corporation, whose goods provided on modest and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores at an average annual rate of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many underpaid workers Walmart come only have themselves at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The range and availability of goods made Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods sell-off in part because little pay their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Recent also complain about poor working conditions, for example, the shortages finished or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Shares in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; participants demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from $30 to $100 a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The average employee Walmart, получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, cannot afford the expense, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raise среднуюю salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it currently spends on a salary. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers that they will do every visit to the store just 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, they will spend more on any 12,39 dollars than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of a Walmart rather noted that protests have occurred only in nine states and not have any corporation малейщего damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its stores with 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday of the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of her cash machines produced in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> A spokesman for the corporation&apos;s Dan фогелман argued in an interview left the site The Huffington Post that jobs left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees, and that the protest was but &quot;the latest пиаровским gimmick&quot; slaughtering its union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;a free ticket!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where their marriages were not stores Walmart (them in this progressive city not LA, and therefore they are not yet), and the &quot;break&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald says he sells billions of dollars of cabins, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you sick and don&apos;t pay you for an honest job! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Джумейн Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law is 7,25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants, over time, increase it, but not much, and in the middle of their ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one does not earn less than them in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can exist in New York on such money, incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through the &quot;break&quot; was almost a quarter of American teens who подрабатывали behind them come after school, living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few who saw in it the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I constantly наталкиваюсь &quot;макдоналдсов,&quot; in an interview with the employees who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, hangs on the Wall Street Journal Forum newspaper commentary, the author whose notes that irresponsibly have children, if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday from McDonald&apos;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and поварам fast-food systems began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that were established in the sphere of fast food trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish the trade union movement activists harassed and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to reach a labor union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - extraordinary turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Restless </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The action came in the mid-day rally at McDonald&apos;s near Times Square, on which made several local Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council джумейн Williams, insisted: McDonald&apos;s says he sells billions of dollars of cabins, and after that he didn&apos;t even don&apos;t pay you for an honest job! &quot;and gives you the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators supported and other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de бласио, insisted that &quot;we must join together in support of fast-food workers with the fact that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new йоркец!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the New York Times described the incident, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people participated in it, though not all of them were fast-food workers, in which tens of thousands of people employed in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> While it is unclear whether this would spark the flames of a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as fool the brain is either&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately is seen largely through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Microsoft and Google, and then became aware that the application filed for a patent in November. </seg>
<seg id="776"> But from a conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in a laboratory кэмбриджской Microsoft шарамом изади is that for this company scientists points - continue stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Them an opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please, in general terms, what is your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;We are human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far in the mass of humanity, at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We also want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The Xbox console and the Kinect sensors, for example, is a step forward, and almost no one today without Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting жестовое management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Is that still awaits us ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> &quot;Despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction on the physical level, a lot still comes on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Enter information improved (system) gets more data, and the conclusion is not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We&apos;re trying to change that, working on a 3D display systems on the basis of various technologies, including проективных. </seg>
<seg id="787"> To release the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can add to the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> &quot;What do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but not overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> &quot;It certainly can&apos;t be described as a panacea - the question of privacy, because they don&apos;t always want to notify people about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project, in which we thought of gestures, but not over), and over such being stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> At the same time gestures filmed наручным браслетом rather than the device&apos;s camera that recorded the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> As long as he is big, but in theory it is possible to reduce the size of the watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general the future for the hybrid type of management, for example, a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;Is it? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - for example, how can you ask me to give you the bank for the pizza? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the same time show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> &quot;I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> &quot;Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> &quot;So you want to get users to adapt to what may, or may not, at the moment the car? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - does not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think, in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine a person&apos;s reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;If you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensor, which claims to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lack of authorization, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> &quot;In principle, it is the current generation, from which you can work in our work on 3D with big demands. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it was nice to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 Mbps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it&apos;s not in themselves мегапикселях, as well as the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From the point of view of all current technologies for us isn&apos;t good enough - it adds to the work of designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is to be remembered not only about the resolution on the axes X and Y, and z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also, the number of frames per second, the speed is very important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movement of the person is dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen бетишес from our рэдмондской laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how it affects the interaction between humans and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work very extensive equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний that frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - and there is no need to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - the Kinect now has three &quot;camera,&quot; one of which is actually the infrared излучатель, and the second - receiver reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> As for the third, the camera is, in fact, a sensor, the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of payments. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play with кривизной location cameras and see how it will help in 3D determining provisions. </seg>
<seg id="827"> &quot;As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You don&apos;t think in terms of daily use augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising technology platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;Of course, all the while разгуливать, holding a smartphone in raised their hands, not very comfortable, but it&apos;s what I think: the steep option would be&quot; переходящая restricted reality, when cloud-based platform, you could switch with points on a smartphone, the projection screen and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device, their strength in this (private things you see only), and at the same time the weakness is restricted reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony старку from&quot; Iron Man, &quot;but also an ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem that often point critics such ideas: no тактильного revocation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepares to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> &quot;I often say that restricted reality is the seventh in his lectures on the account of a breakthrough in the interaction between human and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Think eighth may well be a supplement of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile one interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for images. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It perfectly captures keystrokes! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is technology, which is aimed at giving it a &quot;plethora&quot; pictures in the air - for example, интерференция several aim ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where there is a finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak, as if you blew on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The wrist bracelets, which affect nerve endings in the fingers and there is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;And you were trying to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at that moment, when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> Is this a good idea, we haven&apos;t tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task, over which will have to fight for a long time - how to make a person is physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and the concepts of running tracks (not moving platforms, such as the clubs), as well as huge balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While fool the brain is the medium, the work is still very much for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> What makes the work of virtual reality so attractive to the investigator - many things in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Вкусовщина instead of culture - росбалт.ру </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt continues to project &quot;by the avant-garde,&quot; dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> At the top of the list already were vivid figures art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="850"> A new hero &quot;росбалта&quot; эпатажный artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, which meets the Russian Museum, the fashion, the summer garden parties and вернисажах. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The paintings Cyril Miller has not always gather a crowd of spectators, wherever they are. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller - one purely Petersburg social and philosophical сказочников, the creators of the new lift. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant man Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s to the early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing smile among the citizens, encourage the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently he took at the hands of the Petersburg шарманщиком шарманку, as ripe for this complex role with all my богемным existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why do you still go around the city in the red, but not in yellow or бирюзовом, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose the color red as a fashion designer who view and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world the color red is a compromise between the artist, имиджмейкером and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although everyone in society that almost no grey, causing agitation and aggression malign properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at ensuring that the conversation began. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;And when you realized that must be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> &quot;My work in the theater where the Nevsky were displayed at the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this is my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free unofficial artists staged, a new, free like me were unintelligible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the &quot;Pushkin-10,&quot; and there was more waves. </seg>
<seg id="868"> My throws in music, clothes, theatre, in all genres, but the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> &quot;And all this combined in your art clinic.&quot; I was important experience in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where should gather all the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there has not yet been repair, a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the St. Petersburg богемы house. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were born: номы, tequila-jazz, remember cord led with the project, &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under light plywood songs, they were in обтягивающем tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group parted alive, she became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Трахтенберг was leading many programs to галивских-hahli era. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them трахтенберга, and went to his great career and basic education and upbringing he had received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> &quot;Gallery on 137 of the club,&quot; &quot;грибоедов is resulted from art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There the habitués and our employees are gone. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I&apos;m the hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was &quot;the people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the category of &quot;artist of the year&quot; was named I ended my climaxes. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable work, I&apos;m a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are, you can be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> &quot;Your work is modern style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> &quot;Many hits in them is my pictures vividly reflects the severity and urgency. </seg>
<seg id="885"> My program will be the exhibit, &quot;the Russian Museum in the клоунах.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used social was, now look like this is painful and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the tragic irony, all размазывается клоунах shot. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love we have гротесковые ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing isn&apos;t right. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now on clothes face, based on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps, his hand to it and spit it in a face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the fraud will be lifted by dressing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;As we recently saw you in the city&apos;s role at the organ-grinder.&quot; the cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, like me, they have. </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;Well may and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people crowded together in flocks, богема one loved, простаки another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all crashed on микросообщества, now it&apos;s hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I don&apos;t стодолларовая paper that all like. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we need to think who you like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now every 100 fans of cult hero. </seg>
<seg id="904"> &quot;And the стаса Mikhailova comes as several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> &quot;Come on him брошенки, where сексо-social sphere works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on cultural grounds 300 people will come, and 10,000 not come, and as a result fewer management, money, still languishes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the important thing is don&apos;t deceive them, not spoil possessions. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in his youth such paintings that have one collector they hung on the wall beside ларионовым and фальком. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confused notions. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Say: the spiritual culture, a culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> In no culture of consumption is from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, rose examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned for the sake of money drawing pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I for one&apos;s culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, which lacks high drama? </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing, an official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can engage the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> If correct tsars was all wrong, Kings, maybe not quite understand the culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg is that the experts, but they could be closed, as will require higher experts, who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives вкусовщинка. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same эрарта, but they are what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are artists who have sought to other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is it for you - St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;St. Petersburg is not much more of a culture where the soil is in Moscow, the cultural capital. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have now more than readers, writers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> That&apos;s a lot of people in Europe любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have also made this layer. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project implemented in grant funds of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Having in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans spacecraft with землянами aboard go for the search for extra planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, raises the question, how to continue his race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets, which can develop at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It&apos;s Venus and Mars,&quot; said a senior fellow at the National Astronomical Institute named п.к. Sternberg (the Sai (Vladimir сурдин). </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions more suitable for life on Mars, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures up to 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Can only live at a high altitude or the orbit of Venus... in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach human reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations already in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - getting into the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-дрозофил. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 перепелок eggs are sent into space to see how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get to withdraw completely normal having. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But beyond the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is related to the fact that this птенец should find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving,&quot; said Head of Laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical problems (Vladimir сычев имбп) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, the chicks fluctuate кувыркались. </seg>
<seg id="951"> But after 10 hours of the newborns was complete atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks don&apos;t have responded to the light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that after four days, they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;and two times we вылупляли baby, after it refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them,&quot; concludes the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir сычев. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time with animals biological &quot;миниковчег flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But the биоспутнике &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> He was an experiment with mice that have been sent into space with a fetus. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing unusual. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just a биоспутниках, but again, this is an experiment, and to conduct such research,&quot; said Vladimir сычев. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But approach to the problem of duplication directly in space until it. </seg>
<seg id="963"> No easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, losing, customary habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The same man, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and in a position to create подобающий emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women in space travel for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Tereshkova&apos;s had the greatest risk. </seg>
<seg id="970"> But the most precious thing that humanity is have a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our PM Chaika, and no one on earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether she would have the baby after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;On this issue because no one answered,&quot; says a veteran aerospace industry Vakhtang вачнадзе. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child андриян Nikolaev also was cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana савицкой, twice tested in orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, units are astronauts, from whom after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;But if more, then it is dangerous even when orbital flights,&quot; concludes the Hero of Russia, the hero of the Soviet Union, cosmonaut Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, humanity must find some new way in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The CPC гидролаборатория - mandatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in a zero buoyancy astronauts work skills in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If the water for adults, albeit convenient, but still the alien environment for newborn children - one element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ихтиандры if confirmed - life on the land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months mummy in окоплодной fluid, it is easier to get used to it, then to водичке. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swim, is only two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little to forget something,&quot; says the instructor грудничкового swimming Marina Aksyonov. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if a child is born to weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for a woman gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, reduces the ability to выталкиванию fruit. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Oh well, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special cell to go on birth, chasing it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot; asks include questions Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> No sense of Earth&apos;s gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, dress in a costume for training load. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He simply would be deprived of the fact that he will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, in which we go with you, assuming the birth of a child in the alien environment, an amputee would lead to the fact that we bring to the ground, fully дезадаптированного man,&quot; foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics имбп Ras Igor пестов. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Over time, however, it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships head on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the control department: Schwartz-checking system failed the fault of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of government procurement the Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security-management department, in an interview for the website aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough,&quot; commented the current situation Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar conclusion provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices are Peter нечаса approach to the so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - is it allowed or non-smoking? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be somehow set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister cannot withstand the institutions, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments,&quot; Kala concludes. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a session of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you were talking about a joint project between the German and Czech parties, under which would correspond legislation on public procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> A parallel check in mind, we started, probably two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question is, what the law says, how should be public procurement, next to the national legislation and then also apply in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - in short, the legislation may be &quot;infallible and precise,&quot; but in practice we use in certain parameters behind Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> From this is that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules should focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But exactly how this project can help you, what does it mean to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> This joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the laws, improvement and reduction of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy is getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price, to avoid enrichment and, possibly, of criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the fact that we can&apos;t achieve this, reducing restriction orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system переполнится &quot;securities&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction does not dropped. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems practical application of the law on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as the control system operates in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there such an organization like ours KRU ревизионное-security (management) or it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for institutions, there as our KRU advocates bundesrechnungshof, which in our principle, there is also the board, working a little bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a unit of audit and at the level of the federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Brh could manage only federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the computational Chambers at the federal level. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for local laws, it&apos;s easier than we have? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I wouldn&apos;t want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take, for example, but you can&apos;t definitely say that she is better at all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> So, because they cope better with the control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I don&apos;t like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But we must say that even the model of the country are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If you talk about domestic legislation as an amendment to the law on public procurement, somehow, reflected on your show the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it still does not appear in our works under control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we have control, in fact, be some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take this into account in preparation of future inspections - we only began to use our new tool &quot;неэкономности risk detection,&quot; through which we are almost 14,000 state contracts. &quot;We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will occur, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of the bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope he is. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem, which may arise, such that the rules &quot;ужесточатся&quot; and it will be impossible to observe. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules-controlled enterprises intertwined with the provider (e.g., Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) in the fact that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in this case to tighten the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I don&apos;t think in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not a decision on Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system would only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And while out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s recognize that this path does not lead anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister recently said that GFC will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called system-Schwartz. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; permitted or banned? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be somehow set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister cannot withstand the bodies, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;We&apos;re this law and solve it,&quot; but you can&apos;t say that we will pretend as if nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement has very strict rules, as well as what is right, and should be formally. This would protect public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it&apos;s tragic when a candidate with the best offer only disqualified because of technical shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The road was slippery in places, but mostly проходимы. </seg>

<seg id="1145"> How do you forge ahead with expensive in terms of organisation and logistics? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five players on electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo hold of a large amount of cargo and drawers, in addition to the instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until this справлялись without problems. The Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways have always been great for us prepared that I surprised many times. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without any problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have by now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, London, Luxembourg, and other countries, where everything is better than we had, in Russia, we witnessed what in the East is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared with Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise independent movement of a man in an electric wheelchair at the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also there in the banal things such as a disabled person in the elevator to the road. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> But what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who is concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid perfectly normal that people with the severe form of disability to move on the streets, can go to the bathroom, in the museum, yes anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities participate in public life, and in this we are with the tap tap a little bit superior! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us are well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, the ground and then everything will change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, this isolated cases, people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group tap tap currently very popular, but back on two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the institute едлички as the teacher, there was a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> But because I am a musician and play in a interesting musical circle including the saxophone, along with a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, but over time, as our leading ладя ангелович says, it&apos;s a little bit run amok (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The same popularity came only in the last few years, or something I путаю? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us what we started to join famous singers and actively working on the group&apos;s propaganda. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can appreciate, essentially as if it does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the European Union means we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> The goal stood before you so well turn the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, подражающей one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical that all new shall be taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few rare things, but I&apos;m here to say that tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it naturally. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this sorry completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not any backgrounds and all abandoned by individuals, whom we should pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if something happens in people with disabilities, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Whether the success that you provided a strict head, what do you think? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the job properly, we must be in many things hardcore and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it&apos;s normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week to walk into rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At the present time as a group the tap tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were in the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one ладя ангелович. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and the strength of will, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He will be held Thursday, the day before the expected end 20.12.2012 at 21. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will be held in Prague in the stadium - in the club fléda in Brno and Ostrava Incheba - in the centre plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert all three cities joining телемостом at the time of the execution of the group&apos;s songs the tap tap the &quot;end of the world is abolished.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The goal of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for an educational center studeo with едлички Institute in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Tickets for the concert cost 400 kroner, for children up to 12 years free entrance tickets can be purchased in advance at bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency&apos;s Poland adopted twentieth as a member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started the close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and took an active part in a number of projects over the next years of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But Poland&apos;s path to space began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have flights into space, but it&apos;s not always found with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Let me remind you, for example, about a lecture. Штернфельда that December 6, 1933 represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from its pioneering work &quot;introduction to the космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience unfazed, after a few years штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Yang гадомский was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 in France штернфельд won the prize Robert эсно пельтри and Andre Luiz хирша for the &quot;introduction into the космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Yang гадомский (1899-1966), referred to above, later became a great пропагандистом Astronomy and Space Science. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He wrote a number of books devoted to this discipline and published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Гадомский became known worldwide пропагандистом space, and his contribution was praised in particular the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway дрезина, equipped with missile engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained a mystery, as well as the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even for acceleration or braking carts, the rocket was to be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this дрезине known only from the press of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933 Polish artillery began thinking about missile стрелах. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The study was section of weaponry in cooperation with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops work was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in the specialized press appeared idea фотоэлектрической rocket-fighter, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the following year was working &quot;aerial torpedo-missile and rocket-and-bomb&quot; aviation author леливы-кживоблоцкого. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society space (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine &quot;problems,&quot; in which published four wordy article on астронавтике. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one professor m. Суботович offered to organize a society that will engage космонавтикой. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the same time already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since 1956 Polish society space (ooa) tried to join the International Federation space (founded in 1951), and the autumn ooa became an active member of her. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> But in the next year the first chairman ooa Kazimierz заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position, he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 ooa contributed a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, выполнившей a scientific study. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> A rocket capable of overcoming the distance of 1,800 meters, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently, the improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 tests were carried out on the lake бледовском двухступенчатой RM-2 missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a position to engage in genuine scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 kilometers, and its task was watching высотным wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But it was suspended in 1962 to further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Heiress became the first missiles of the type of RM meteor-1 rocket, developed in the years between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as двухступенчатая, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Developed by three types (identified as meteor-1A, -1в and -1с), who were split by the size of the camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, or meteor-1C - 0,62л. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> All three types have a maximum range of flight was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968, took place at the Aviation Institute of meteor-2 missile development, and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor missile-2 with initial weighing 380 kg was able to cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then the meteor-2н version was built and meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Should also mention Poland&apos;s membership in the Committee on Space Research (коспар) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee коспар two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in Soviet artificial satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The ruling sparked heated debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the topic from a broad perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of a multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that separate economic units, the national economies, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no restricted the movement of private capital along with unrestrained financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) raises price tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept to understand the condition, when producer by delivering cheap goods to survive in the economic competition, however, that &quot;misleading&quot; cost competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or shifting production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where labor costs, compared with others, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital has no social responsibility, including unemployment is produced for them are inevitable state spending on social spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> On the whole, the situation is the unwillingness gentlemen employers pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that you don&apos;t have to be specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Бесцеремонные methods of private capital create economies at the level of individual states situation, when governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the government put the population at the mercy of their own private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> It is also reflected primarily to change the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is economically make your ​ ​ people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It operates as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and, at the same time, serves as an instrument for cuts workers&apos; rights in the area of labor laws. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of increased levels of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching $1 million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy constantly cases occur, when employed people receive a salary that state they must доплачивать, so they got a living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economic measures in virtually all of the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition, in which people, under pressure from the catastrophic fall social status, forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist at extremely low pay on the outskirts of society in the hope that someday private investment capital comes into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But the question is, where he would? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the funds come from other EU countries, while poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as well as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for European share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the equity capital management, which managed the economy will lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not managing actions to interfere in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Further should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost managing policy and to the entire state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> A definitive answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and the omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result, we have a situation безысходную проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost everyone deserves punishment, but it is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is that the public ministry due to a lack of financial resources are drafting bills to private law firms, which are closely related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then the Bundestag claims these bills. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, Western-style constitution reads, and from financially powerful groups, prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly turns in such ​ ​ situation, as described аппианом at work &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Pompeii and Caesar&apos;s&quot;: &quot;The state has long been falls, and agencies involved in the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The bribes, illegally receiving handouts with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any taboos, and people went to vote with pre-sold &quot;voice&quot; decent people never баллотировались for the position of the ruler, ultimately, once the state for eight months left without consul &quot;....&quot; seriously started talking about the fact that the energetic man &quot;autocracy and necessity of choice is the only salvation in this terrible situation.. аппиан thought it was Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced on democracy and autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard for the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital has at its core is not intended for use in public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to reform itself deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of fascist and communist regimes means we should look for the reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> To date the existence of the liberal type of democracy and the absence of these regimes can be seen as a pause, after which the next round is expected. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First and foremost, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, social and humanitarian catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least will not last forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both at the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will boost shares of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;The violence will not do, and never could get&quot; sting, the song &quot;fragile,&quot; where the main стихом рефрена are the words: &quot;Don&apos;t forget what we&apos;re fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons don&apos;t want war, they would not have been&quot; dying at hatterelles шнапер, wife меера амшела Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, caused a lot of feedback. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some favor Israel, defending his position, however, that he has the right to self-defense, but Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, the Israeli state, and the state of Israel to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of the killing the victim is the criminal, and who, in the end, today&apos;s Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and has not been seen since the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, take a look at the people first and foremost are going for 95 years of tension (counting from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning backed historical facts, some of them are on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily the story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less clear is whether these people to take their own steps, or someone who stood behind the throne of them directed their actions to advance its goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Should admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and something from them, the authorities could not happen for the life of a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the rich families астрономически is one that could be seen as the head of octopus (I don&apos;t know whether someone is on them, but it&apos;s not excluded) - Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Don&apos;t write a lot about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to put an end to rumors linking their name with criminal action in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and that has led to consolidate their power, augmenting the wealth or at the same time, and in addition to another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Among them are key stakes in almost all of the world&apos;s central banks, and against the countries whose central banks, they do not have their own shares, they have or are preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq was five countries, only four remained after Qaddafi&apos;s ouster, but, at the same time, the Russian government pledged his country&apos;s central bank in their own hands. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own понимай (-) government money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve (Fed). The deputy Luis макфадден was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst of global power in the period from 1859-1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created a great Mason 33-tier Albert пайком. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first task of the war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially in the UK, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population to approximately 0.5-1 billion (such a number of slaves would be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final grab absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method by which working group of the richest families headed by Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao is the order out of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the base of the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by killing габсбургского heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed by Tsarist Russia Bolshevik революциию. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended in sudden, unreasonable given and economically surrender of Germany (no longer have the necessity of a war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European powers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to facilitate the launch of the second world war the bankers and politicians have latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations, as a precondition to radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans are strong enough, обличающего guilty and offering simple solutions leader, on a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a fifth column, while stoking the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked one branch, the founding of the Zionist movement, which sought to create a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion, preferably in the history of the Jews. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The draft declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, to be the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks there on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler has resurfaced in chains, in which it had originally planned, the bankers, or anything that he did, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was driven by the military репарациями on World War 2-Yu, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create the war home third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp divide people on both supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if all started with individuals and their pursuit of global power greed? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we need to distinguish them from ordinary people of Israel of leaders, because, as we have, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Israel&apos;s current Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s Hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to escalate the conflict in the world, and given Iran&apos;s control of the strait ормузским containing 20% of the world&apos;s oil reserves (судоходный corridor is only two miles wide), &quot;and it would lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In which light now are the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;What we need is a crisis, and people will accept the new world order.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1334"> But is it the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;Argo&quot; operation: when worse nowhere, call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> A crowd of Islamist students in November 1979, demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be freed in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, either fled after the revolution in the United States, which has been the patron saint of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US administration was not a positive outcome of the situation - she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later placed a failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after talks brokered by Algeria&apos;s government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate has provoked a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment at home. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The defeat in Iran have largely contributed to the defeat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, ended the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck&apos;s &quot;Argo&quot; operation describes one of the episodes of history, which brought America small victories. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After the complex changes they finished their way into the Canadian Embassy residence. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, at the same time helped an legend cover, according to which they rode on the Canadian sea as the location for filming crew members of the group, the country&apos;s подыскивавшие science-fiction epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the &quot;evacuation&quot; expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So the legend was true, in specialized magazines, wrote about the film project, said at a press conference, fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony мендеса. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film аффлека is a combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film-киноопус success story,&quot; lead nowhere, fraud is an example might be a series of films about оушена friends. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes from Tehran (a subtitle identifies signal historical photographs of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the movie - there are no big differences in this). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, criss-with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - the men in suits are discussing the situation to the negotiating table, on the staircases institutions, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben аффлеку remarkably accomplished рестарт career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From высмеянного actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;After the operation, his third feature film&quot; Argo &quot;dark detective&quot; Goodbye, goodbye, Baby &quot;(2007) and the thriller&quot; The Town &quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film аффлека, who remains in his hometown Boston is the director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of place in this atmosphere is a quality that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And it shows in &quot;Argo,&quot; Affleck where Tehran &quot;plays Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the confusion and непредвиденности emotions that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in the fictional scenes (fake) headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not suggest a variety of exciting scenes of cinematic significance. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He works very well with this little, sometimes something додумывает - where it all goes wrong elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis in Tehran&apos;s airport, and the chase on runway looks pretty farfetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The lack of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many things in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but more space, but they would have deserved their characters in the film is far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, you can watch a movie with moderate interest, evaluating the and retro-style, воссоздающий thrillers Seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But captures with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for reminders about one, yet in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated notions about omnipotent and всезнающих intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for bananas, balloons and circus asset </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually executes a poll of the most bizarre bank fees, has now decided to announce the competition on &quot;the most absurd ruling or the project from EU workshop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We сподвигло to this recent event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,&quot; said the organizer of the questionnaire &quot;law&quot; Patrick нагер. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nomination already nominated абсурдностей - the recent decision of the European Court to unify the premium rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far the women have benefits for life insurance and for insurance companies because they are objectively less подверженными at risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;further extraordinary ideas from the EU workshop people can nominate for the contest before the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, &quot;said нагер. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The controversial EU directives include, for example, and compulsory appendix биокомпонентов in fuel that damages as a result of nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or directive of cages for chickens, resulting in this year significantly tightened the eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;бутербродное butter&quot; or withdrawal from Sale classic light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> High-quality bananas must be 14 inches long. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> A pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protected any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even threatened вета defends the demands of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The lobby interests are as follows: for example, higher quality bananas in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare to show the &quot;unusual кривизну.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> At the same time the European Commission high-order that only гармонизирует existing piecemeal national rules that осложняли trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, despite the resistance of some states, yet softened the standards of fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the directive will lead to расточению products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The winning candidate in the poll may be, and last year&apos;s ruling, the EU, under which sold balloons need снабжаться warned that children under eight years can&apos;t finagle their unattended adults. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU appealed to American Studies, in accordance with which balloons in the game are a potential cause of children&apos;s death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, which prohibited blowing in ярмарочные дуделки. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Funny ideas are born and at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Enough is absurd and the European officials regarding the rule: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy theme for the use of the name of Macedonia, Greece, and should instead talk &quot;FYROM (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in co-operation with the Association of liberal economists &quot;the principle of non-interference&quot; (laissez faire), proposed for voting, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, the EU rule about the amount of food on the territory of the founding of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU imposed the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Later the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set of canned mushrooms, for which she threatened a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the questionnaire also excited and pay for some countries for the fact that they have no idea of the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for a statement about getting subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage, because we have the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Ask the European Union for compensation, &quot;said in the fall of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw Palace (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The argument, he pointed out that the country was a grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying state was full of warehouses, which was to remove. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the EU, the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, according to the паласу, we had to pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, staged a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development, руководимое minister Paul German (US-of Moldova Romania), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on filing on subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU: bizarre orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the decision in the member states could easily become a target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU grants for projects that don&apos;t have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Evokes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products in Brussels, and it doesn&apos;t always win in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and by the Austrians retained the name &quot;оломоуцкие curds,&quot; but &quot;туземский rum,&quot; tradition has its roots in our country in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the &quot;туземак.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Called for Sherry can only products from cane дистиллята, rather than from sugar beets. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The official list of eligible products in the EU, along with the world famous &quot;горгондзола,&quot; and &quot;feta cheeses марципаном from German Luebeck or пармской ham, already have, for example, Mattoni сухари, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The EU trademark can also be proud of пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие Cork. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want I guarded Republic, but I&apos;m a big fan, &quot;says окамура. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. senator, comes as a man in the head running for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think about how to be a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we have everything in the country function without any problems, I would have never ran. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t watch over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as people here by thieves, raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I have no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like it, then try to find a solution, as this change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was 40 years old and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of the president or a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you got, but soon went to the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Don&apos;t turn you in such a way back to the people that you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I said all the time that включусь in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I said that if I selected by the senator, will run for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need to have the greatest impact and vast powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not only that we as a nation ропщем at home in a bar or watching television, but at the same time willing to bruise on everyone who tries to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The media, which are added to this man очерняют, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was counsel its пароубека. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with theses on material and criminal liability of the politicians and on the opposite of property declarations worth more than twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To accomplish this, we need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have no such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbying all excursions to become free enterprise, it could push. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem lies in политиканстве - when someone comes in with a good offer to the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, and it deters citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent беспартийного person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am without the party раскладывания by Heymans, without looking at the premises can take from each party, what is best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me, my people are likely to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> No matter - a little bit for me a little bit to the right or the left. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it&apos;s important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> This is not about the fact that someone refers to someone to the left and the right, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support the decision of any good for society, whether it offers the hrcm or GFC, and I&apos;m the same way against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry, when someone says you populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it does not prove whether you what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you have some ideal goals and views as well. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And for that you try to come close. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all proposals, about which I say, already operate in the world, or prominent experts say about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics you don&apos;t hold for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you out to people and talk with them, then you will be able to implement and criminally responsible? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Just try to entice them and convince politicians, journalists and the public on their side, so we have accomplished their goal. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, he would not have made the problems to direct TV broadcasting, in which I turn to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in the event of failure, will tell why they don&apos;t want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there will be a strong personality, which repeat abuse, then it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take direct presidential elections - it was to public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Say directly that I&apos;m a lover, not a genius, and not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their views and beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I&apos;m trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, to be completed within six years and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It kind of sounds like окамура should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one, I didn&apos;t do anything, so I went around a number of famous people to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with a large volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also I at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan лоренцову, which exposed the fraud with a light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward his candidacy because people did their dissatisfaction with the decision, but now I feel in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We only two independents in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections of governors and mayors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about it, because I have no time to test the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I have a lot of money on it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about property declarations, and how well your own affairs with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property worth approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have an apartment, a plot in Prague at a cost of about $25 million to 10 million, another 8 million on an apartment, a collection of works of art around 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Boleslav суперб per million, as well as several million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston-Martin emerged from me, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women and, at the same time, fought against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You take on Aston-Martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money in the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but do not want their own money invested in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It&apos;s not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no more than 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I get in debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign, I have already been invested 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I had no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I don&apos;t have to pay for the campaign from his pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on the campaign I essentially cover сенаторская salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But with that money I wouldn&apos;t see, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which costs 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to just make money, so they would never ran. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So, you want to do business, to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Don&apos;t you have said that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, its activities I partially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like, that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I need to live something, too. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> But, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive each month? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From 200 to 400 thousand that get even further. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> But if I became president, my business would be finished. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview you find in субботнем edition of the newspaper &quot;right.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1503"> But Stefan спермон, the IT specialist at located near a large enterprise, thinks so: &quot;No, this building is really beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask myself: why We today another library? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has the iPad, Internet and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now nobody voluntarily walks in such prehistoric library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному city under роттердамом, belongs to an unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat that unfortunate fact several years ago decided to contribute to the overall education and build seven fictional bridges, which depicted on the euro notes, as magnificently painted miniatures of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame Maass from Rotterdam architectural bureau km3, master bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, regarded by the task with his usual - and appeared to tender an audition in 2003 with a grin on his face and five books under her arm. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury he looked and winked, naughty Maass pulls out of his original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my proposal: &quot;Gore&apos;s book&quot; in the so-called спейкениссе букенберг! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain has grown at a cost of 30 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the ревитализации project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of at least 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, &quot;Gore&apos;s book&quot; The best library of the Netherlands was awarded the second prize contest of 2012. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project also participates in the national contest Dutch wooden structures of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, a suburb, who previously could not offer nothing but the postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely Hall, the white facades which suggests молокозаводе, became richer than the one modern piece of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But the most important thing is to спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town public building cultural destination. </seg>

<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually неуютный and a&quot; blame Maass says. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We put the classical configuration of space on its head and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inner space mountain book used skillfully: located in the center of the offices, Internet chess club, a library, an environmental center and technical facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially delight black bookcases that serve the finish walls, then the парапетами лестничными railing. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture and smell unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even sophisticated builders, architects and engineers, lost in wonder, what is the unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We tried to work with secondary materials,&quot; explains йоп трауборст, project manager, who is representing the community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once on a single agricultural enterprise in фрисландии we met an agricultural byproduct. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands as the lining the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It&apos;s cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textile serves one or two of the season, then he can throw. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library this painting - for the first time in such quantities - was спрессовано four centimeters in thickness panel. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, monolithic, durable material, by means of their smell a bit like a new car and a little bit sneakers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top are 105 stages. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Whoever breaks the path of almost 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and tree фикусами in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place to correct the air humidity on literary Hill. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The cost of a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment,&quot; says троуборст. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heat is used for its heating and cooling of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although Gore&apos;s book is under glass entered, even on clear days the sun hits in only for a short period of time. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Vast farms of клееной wood, located virtually perpendicular to the facade, provide shade and take upon themselves the bulk of the sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room is very nice. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The protection offer fully automatic roller curtains. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan спермон mentioned above skeptic of IT sector, has already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Лизетте верхайг also were already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as traditional Chinese medicine преподавательница Cynthia богард, which called the &quot;soul спейкениссе букенберг, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to a book from their own meetings. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully consisting of library - at the time it was delivering books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves заставлены to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than полупустая library,&quot; says the architect blame Maass. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that now, thanks to our invitation, every citizen in some way connected with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is a part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, km3 managed to solve a problem that the professional jargon called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Спейкениссе wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And even though they&apos;re very young and необразованны. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for building identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo said: &quot;The Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to the Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that she will vote against the Palestinian bid to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained in the voting. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in the Gaza Strip. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I think, that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical toward Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, by the United States, to the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent unified policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only нащупывают its role, but are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, which hosts France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly is a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to hold the position in its national interest, not depends on the position of the United States or the European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> German economic interests largely differ from those of other large states, and that is why Germany must defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these economic interests contributed to a position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, she should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I wouldn&apos;t give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-way communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States has an understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think that it was the same dramatic надлом, as the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Germany may even thus gained a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, clearly voted veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There is a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> On the strength of American domestic policy such differences existed forever. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of the European position in the depths of the soul. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But the government in connection with the local political situation, of course, cannot take such a position openly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences in opinion is not so significant, as always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama may not be out of place in a delight from Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> If Germany can combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the European Union on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that this is a difficult situation for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there was one, непротиворечивая European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is why they cannot act within the framework of a more broad-based approach and forced to act instead relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> So they come with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It&apos;s clear that it&apos;s difficult for Germany, if only because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - don&apos;t take it upon myself really the main role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or a leading role still difficult given Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not yet accustomed to it, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, it is always difficult to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assumes an important role, are very different German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans don&apos;t just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, this is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account a variety of opinions and neighbors, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So far, the U.S. influence in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment the EU not fills the vacuum, who then left? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like, unpleasant or reinforces the enmity to you - such is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, the transatlantic Academy in Washington, deputy director of the Institute, in which political analysts, academics and experts from Europe and North America together are the problems of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Szabo, a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic ties. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;trademark protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is it Armani polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is officially registered the name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Yet it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be sued. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But it is unclear whether they assert their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says the company&apos;s lawyer, Thomas паттлох Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights violations on trademarks in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week appears in a case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Имитаторам enough to add just a few letters, to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci is Lu-you can register instead Prada, Gucci, Prada-kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German enterprises, for example, sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Паттлох opens the folder with records of trademark registration offices in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> September 14, 2010 the company recorded a trade mark there Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities have many department stores, selling almost exclusively forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But no such case паттлоха. On behalf of their delegants he opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the agency the right to use the name, trademark registration, which already is somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call this &quot;ban минпай,&quot; Mark-passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with &quot;дакуань ban.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So are women, who are hunting for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;This damages the business, with the need to fight,&quot; паттлох believes. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;trademark pointed, a unique position is lost, the image suffer very much.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The procedural costs in the affected industries and financial losses calculated by the millions, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company&apos;s sales volume of 15 billion euros per year with market research at CLSA, China is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it&apos;s difficult to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register of trade marks, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Паттлох tells about cases in which the court declined claims, because after a long time опротестованное title was &quot;a reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If a complainant is lucky, he will even must pay плагиатору, as did the damage his trade to the mark in China, says паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also a famous case of graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which just before a firm-maker Putzmeister бетононасосов. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> So the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Купившая Volvo, Geely originally used blue-and-white logo, experiencing BMW; the process was a success, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of fashion goods advertised lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, have celebrated the crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities did not consider himself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademark office ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of staff and equipment premises there occurred difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the past year was &quot;a return to normal from an emergency situation in the process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the number of objections of raw cases decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It closed almost 57.000 such cases, by as much as 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To deal with this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This means that China and the record for the tenth time in a row, led the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If simplify, this means that each check worth an average of 160 euros or 1280 yuan. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Contest its worth many times more, as it shows a German family enterprise Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group is struggling against the Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans were able to ensure that the illegal manufacture them fake auto parts was gone. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But simulation secured a Chinese trademark rights Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was an oversight, as well as the names of their own in Germany are not subject to the protection, says ханно вентцлер, chairman of the board of the chemical Freudenberg specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the office registered trademarks ctmo rejected pretension мюнхенцев. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both instances following Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to struggle so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> To be on the alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Вентцлер hopes to bring the case to a conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and robs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs barely to archive and accounting firms to review even acts a hundred years old, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg inconclusively suggested the adverse party &quot;greater шестизначную amount in Euro&quot; for a settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It is clear, however, how much it costs us,&quot; says вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The danger of the Far East to infect even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> But just in case, if decoys register there for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We need to be vigilant,&quot; вентцлер says. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather than foreigners should &quot;all that is in any way to protect, register as well as in China,&quot; says вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can do much more than check. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about a trade mark, it will have to pay the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we supplant in contested segment of the market. </seg>

<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first имбогни participants saw many children in the streets, which not only parental care, but simply lacked the: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without schooling a man in a poor country have no chance at all. </seg>

<seg id="2055"> On Sunday the new head of Mexico&apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto puts the presidential перевязь and will take the reins of the country. </seg>

<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government claims to the Mexican people about their willingness to deal with violence,&quot; said earlier this week Mr Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before such statements by the president of the United States the political career of Mr Peña Nieto evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, in густонаселенном and opinions about the new leader, the vast state surrounding the capital of a country divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> The outspoken man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic town Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents put him in for the revival of tourism, the resort industry and infrastructure development. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Before the city could get through one of the new highway, built Mr. Peña Nieto, the Nam, which differs from the roads with выбоинами and pits that were previously at this place. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> A placard with his name hangs on a modern building sports center and the blockbuster interactive museum devoted to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We associate with him hope of real and serious changes,&quot; says his friend and political ally ольвера Gabriel Hernandez, a congresswoman from upstate New York led by Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect real and decisive change that our country so desperately needed, primarily in the area of security and economic development. </seg>

<seg id="2074"> But in another part of the state&apos;s many people have had a different view of former have. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The municipality несауалькойотль, also known under the name of Ciudad-support, poses the most stark contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under эстакадами highways, in many ways, he is a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality also wear dour character of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year to restrain gangs, drug trading in these areas, the troops were involved; and violence against women is particularly acute here. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> The lake near the vast landfill only a few dozen bodies were discovered over the past two years killed the women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico during губернаторства Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure in the violent city of Ciudad-Wednesday, whose name became infamous прославившемся нарицательным, when it comes to the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about him in the best-case scenario, we can say that during his tenure as governor, he could not cope with the problem of the killings of women. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, if his administration accused completely ignoring the problem. </seg>

<seg id="2089"> This, they said, was denied this family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;state officials appealed to me, as with the old сплетницей upset нарушительницей tranquility. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people simply have to believe what they say, and помалкивали. </seg>

<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not complained mistreatment, the indictment claims. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to refute claims Bradley мэннинга about poor conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> During the hearing, special attention was paid to мэннинга stay in a military prison in Virginia квантико. </seg>

<seg id="2113"> &quot;They had&quot; no problems &quot;(after), but it doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t discuss my complaints raised this issue in a conversation,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked мэннинга, why he had not complained of ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission, рассматривавшей suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve with his shot mode &quot;prevention of injury&quot; and softened the terms and conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited the detention regime - at a level lower than the supervision regime with the aim of preventing suicide - was introduced for the protection of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to know the administration, that is all right with me, so they canceled the regime of injury prevention... to improved the quality of my life, from my point of view,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he held for nearly two months, before he was transferred to the prison at the naval base in квантико, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>

<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> While in квантико, Manning, in his words, spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country&apos;s tough times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben наваретте believes that Mexican American descent torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked along the corridor for arrivals, approached the border zone and remained in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs point to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood for a few seconds before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my whole life was Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York feel Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I stopped at the complex structure of &quot;an American of Mexican descent. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, had no need for conventional names or intricate designs. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak in Spanish well enough to ask questions or to respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the tongue, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I pulled my American passport and was in line for extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered the story a few days ago, when Mexico&apos;s newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were usual for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Peña Nieto president willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, in which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will remain in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Peña Nieto, the president promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but did not mention any specific proposals. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought about the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and under дулом rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans have for centuries, rather than minutes, and see reminders of those events around. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Why should only any statesman us обмолвиться any word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society immediately given complain that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> At the same time Mexico&apos;s relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States are the most complex. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> If you want to talk about insults? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> It is enough for them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves, and those for whom there are no such opportunities in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history anyone - a father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Often they were Mexicans, a certain type of &quot;смуглые малообразованные, from a poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we forget about it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we don&apos;t forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination запутано and is unclear, but we know which country considered his. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> At the same time, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We respond to them in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people like to ненастоящим Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not enough good talk in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico is not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them because of failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We don&apos;t have it now for a silk curtain, сытую life found in the United States, but lost the spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a kid, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is a shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time the Americans of Mexican descent, many of my friends do not feel any belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> But in the U.S. we are Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during her trip, like our relationship without the muddled enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans of Mexican descent were kind of ambassadors in Mexico and represented its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell his fellow Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her visit, and could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will come out of it. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too much offense in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> But given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug binge, many of us do not believe this country is very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but out of this themselves, амигос. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And rightly so. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent were still in it for him, as he recently did with their relatives in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle in the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could be a fragile foundation for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Lee is possible long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The next round of bloodshed leads to a conclusion about the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound, as usual, meaningless disputes about who started first; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном change came to the conflict in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To this can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab Spring &quot;in the rebellious закружили storm many established realities, the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to stay away from the vortex, потрясшего region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than previously. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons, giving hope for an exit from this deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the present situation gives no reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a cease-fire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, that this week&apos;s clashes only strengthened security on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite incurred losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some gang leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact Hamas intensified its popularity on the west bank of the Jordan River - another Palestinian territory, currently controlled more moderate Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working against them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas and more influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf, Qatar followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Торжествующие Hamas supporters claim about creating the Islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, in which governs the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels overthrew the rule of President Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king&apos;s power is threatened by the allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred in the most populated areas on the southern borders of Israel and an Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice cannot drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of a &quot;tough&quot; line in Israel come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In a military sense, Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s &quot;Iron Dome&quot; missile system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many running Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries also laid the blame for the start of the latest round of violence by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets, issued from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall, which comes on the territory of the west bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the Palestinian state, and advocates Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party is in preparation for a course on 22 January elections is reunited with even more violent conservatives led infrastructure Lieberman, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What meaning to the Palestinians and give them their own country? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If put into their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from the rockets at Israel, as their brethren in Gaza do? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise his head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the proponents of a &quot;tough&quot; line victorious; but their calculations can be proven wrong in the Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Though the Islamists, who came to power in Egypt and other countries that are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Defense part of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, Israel&apos;s combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The president of Egypt, Morsi, who worked together with Barack Obama pragmatism over ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the democratic change in the Arab world, depriving the Palestinians&apos; right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later all hell breaks loose on the territories occupied by Israel, like House, взорванному in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population is only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For the bloody operation, which are held every few years for the suppression of the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip, must pay a growing discontent in the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need external a pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Remains the only solution, to which tirelessly calling our newspaper and sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world: the education of the two countries and territories in exchange for security concessions by Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, not too impressive in the short term, &quot;the hope that a cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on both sides of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which it&apos;s time to take the decision to block the shipment of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a profitable position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish state since 1967 borders with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation with Hamas and Fatah movements. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would have made more than the forthcoming vote for the creation of a Palestinian state at the United Nations, the result of which may become a virtual statehood recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Should play a role in helping to bring Israel to the negotiating table, and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented a plan for a peaceful settlement of their own. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he still shows an unwillingness to connect the solution to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> So disastrously недальновидная position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is only possible in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law came into force in Australia about unified packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The images and warnings about the hazards of smoking affected parts of the body&apos;s disease in contrast are on a damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice Australian law on a package of cigarettes and tobacco-type entered into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same transmission glum-olive color with nasty snapshot of the images of the children and the affected parts of the body, whose health has been decimated their parents&apos; smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from different backgrounds and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between wads, introduced in a compulsory manner with this Saturday - the name brands, which published the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of this action is to deter young people from smoking, depriving drop the habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for such a decision on the results of the research, unprecedented that people do not sign up to 26 years of smoking in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Obviously, that even in very young children understand the sense that tobacco companies are trying to communicate with the help of packaging,&quot; explains the health minister Tanya плиберсек, citing studies, Pulp, which, for example, the crown in a logo is associated with children with the idea of the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of similar measures already view and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, in which will be available and cheap cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiate,&quot; says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco companies in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The producers of counterfeit goods from China and Indonesia will supply more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone new laws, on the contrary, contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone boxes, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew (virtually from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris lost a case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> In the words of Sandra ha, Zico company already has about six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, it is good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among just a part of the population that the aim of these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption of a series of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco advertising shifted to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government banned Web sites and local companies advertise on the network, but it cannot restrict foreign sites in this. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet you seem very tempting,&quot; explains Beca Freeman, исследующая issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether it is the ordinary citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare the time and effort and made the video, or is behind this advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of British American Tobacco Company argues that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules, rather than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states make claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relations with Australia is very small. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya плиберсек, government обсуждало with other countries to make them similar laws on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada imposed the first mandatory posting photos, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The tightening of laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures of me not graze. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just выхватываешь прячешь and cigarette pack in my pocket,&quot; said Victor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photo of the pack on the mouth tumors. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, this is the only thing that can make me quit my daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yiu, head of King of the pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, argues that the same packaging difficult job placement of goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before I had the unloading of the new party was an hour, and now four hours,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have taken and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, OK, all over, close the shop,&quot; he says, вскидывая hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it&apos;s not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our aircraft have revealed a mechanical problem and was replaced by another plane, which we and дожидались. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I won&apos;t kid you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, or an iPhone or even shops up trade. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But in recent years, increasingly, scientists and experts on child development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children here are not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This makes the brain distracted on interesting related topics that, perhaps, is the creative work. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And since everyone in the modern world, we are constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we should strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And, at the same time, no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> Still, we return to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Before I, like many others, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention era, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Not so, says Peter туи, professor of Greek and Roman Canadian history at the University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom boasts a very ancient history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in помпеях discovered Latin inscriptions of boredom, from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> At the same time remains an open question, as we understand bores. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, &quot;says John D. иствуд, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that vision and understanding of boredom often spins. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Studying the materials research on this topic and by Professor иствуд and his colleagues, the question of the target group in 100 people came to the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;want but cannot do so, that would bring them the satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, lies in the fact that скучающий man does not do something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Don&apos;t want nothing to do with apathy. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The experienced boredom, he says, is &quot;a violation of the attention and associated with this worsening mood and feeling that time is slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> According to a description boredom can seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor иствуд argues that despite a possible link between the two conditions, скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the outside world and circumstances, and in the Depression, people see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to concentrate on something. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study, &quot;one reason: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor иствуд with colleagues cite previously conducted an experiment, participants who listened to the recorded voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of the programs included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could barely read, and a third group was only recorded voices without any sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The participants, who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, more than any other - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons and claimed that boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or compelling task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. фенске, associate professor of neurology at the University гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное, &quot;for example, всматриваясь in search of marriage in the flow of the products in the pipeline, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> He said that when people start покачиваться on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply cannot relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and turn, learn better and запоминают more information than the children, from which require sit tight,&quot; says Professor фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments we all experience boredom: when flight delay (as in my case), monotonous speech listening, reading неинтересный film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people have different degree inclination to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s for measuring such individual features researchers have developed a special &quot;a propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The questions and statements are used to determine the assessment on such a scale, for example, &quot;a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved&quot; or &quot;me too much fun, so no matter what, do not have enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that скучают boys more than girls, &quot;says Stephen воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly in the presence of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But on the whole the teenagers do often скучают. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted through пейджера nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with seven or eight times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they are bored at school and at the time of the homework, and 23 percent said they bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> At the same time only 3 percent of the parents said that they are bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would have been similar data about boredom, now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that &quot;in adolescence is the tendency of boredom,&quot; mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully resolve than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: boredom useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations of it, as studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous individual actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, &quot;says Professor воданович, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us that it should do something else; it is boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However, this same brain doesn&apos;t always knows what to do better. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you direct that energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you&apos;re watching TV, you will get better soon for some time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child bored and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom on their own or as any other way to manage their time and employment, &quot;said Professor фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;These skills and self-regulation that uses in a variety of situations,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to occupy myself something, he also learns self at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that bores need somehow praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, you shouldn&apos;t think of her as something bad, too. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor иствуд agree with that. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see it in such a way that we need more experience boredom with boredom is extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact people are somehow disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world, we have grown accustomed to constant over-stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when we way, silence and didn&apos;t know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is unclear how the new law will apply for the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony ороско, девятнадцатилетний player the football team and the student community college in southeastern Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be entirely legitimate throughout the state, storing small portions of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. ороско says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with канзасом when police stopped them. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. ороско came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, each of which is due to a $100 fine and appointed a trial date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; says Mr ороско. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But if he was a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of uncertainty, which lasts for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much from the law but from the place of examination. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Marijuana-related charges for minor offences, are already in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations already ceased to charge people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small doses that would be legitimate, as only a couple of weeks later, the law comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in more conservative districts, Colorado prosecutors have decided to review the case, associated with marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time in some cities from Denver suburbs to the Mountain West vote for something, to prevent the emergence of new, state licensed stores in their places for the sale of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is growing so fast that I don&apos;t even know what to expect further,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora police chief in a small town in the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington state also озадачено почесывают heads. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will formulate rules to determine the order of licensing cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done until December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in resolving issues at the beginning of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;in Colorado and a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; explains Brian Smith, a representative of the council to regulate the production and distribution of alcoholic products in Washington state. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, rather than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent on which we could navigate,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and for an entire year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is no more, and the right of possession of marijuana already узаконено. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But there&apos;s more complicated technical issues that must be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of &quot;adequate access to licensed marijuana prohibition on trade with it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and day-care centers. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;particularly difficult will publish licensed marijuana trade enterprises in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21, a police chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates in an e-mail message that the city prosecutor&apos;s office will no longer attract persons under 21 years of age, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations &quot;starting from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A police chief Oates said that the police would monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals in the city, BT marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The district attorney уэлд in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors will still be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users of its people to undergo a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused of and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of our institutions - haunt for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,&quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where voting members rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer draws to adult responsibility for possession of a small quantity of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The District Attorney Pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to charge for already open cases involving the custody of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that our direct responsibility to enforce the law until he will not change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55 percent of Colorado residents who took part in the voting, supported the inclusion of issues of the legal system and the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state, this decision will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> A controversial reaction of people in different locations across the state has ambiguity local authorities&apos; attitude toward the state&apos;s experiment with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The district prosecutors on this issue, there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains Sean макалистер денверский lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They sought for so long people for it, that it can&apos;t really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington, the United States, in which belong to a small number of marijuana as well as to alcohol is destined to become a pilot field throughout the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously await instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to examine the cultivation and sale of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Marijuana legalization supporters hope that the Justice Department will on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several gained wide arrests of traffickers and patients, doing marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases made good on the trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs will hardly rush home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to fight drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election that some of the local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana and so could not open before next year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Over the past week Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, raised on the six-ban on trade of marijuana, which apparently will be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to be in a position that we выдадим someone license, then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and those who voted for that state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Still a lot of unresolved issues. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Петронелла уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I&apos;m a conservative. </seg>

<seg id="2409"> My father and elder brother described him as the best in the world, and studied at Oxford University, a modern equivalent antique symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And yet, after two weeks of study at the historical faculty вустерского College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I gathered my bags and left, which led to the first real scandal in my life. </seg>

<seg id="2415"> In fact, it is not so funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied in a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Hounded me for one reason only, and in this renowned cradle light it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow уайэтт, Margaret Thatcher was known as an advisor, and I myself was supported the Conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You ask, why reminiscing about it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, a new generation of students, rising center-right views, is subject to the same persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to students at Oxford-conservatives is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same kind of protection of their rights, such as the one is disabled, ethnic and sexual minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2431"> &quot;This represents a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, as well as for normal life just members of the club,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I was there in September 1986, робкой and shy восемнадцатилетней girl. </seg>

<seg id="2435"> For the year before university voting deprived former student Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the early days of the week freshmen, when students get to know each other with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that awaited me in front of him. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I still didn&apos;t know that teachers not only looked through his fingers to poison themselves with pleasure, but also conservative students took part in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The political issues - the miners&apos; strike, privatization, and the government&apos;s refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through обшитые wooden panels walls audiences. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> On my first seminar I need the eighteenth-century French text was translated into English, and I was not prepared for what followed it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss уайэтт, a teacher, now the late Harry Pitt said, please note the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text gave me with difficulty, I запиналась. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was very желчным man with a face like a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;тэтчеристы fundamentally not teach French or they simply lacks a brain drain?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students захихикали. </seg>

<seg id="2447"> &quot;We advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rolling in the society,&quot; пробрюзжал Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room absolutely miserable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> In the evening in college, I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, a student from the second year of the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of University of conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Unfortunately, it is as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> On each one suspect in sympathy for conservatives, will be such a mockery. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> Me very hard, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most conservative freshmen притворяются that they Labour. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I did try to face it. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that it does not agree with all that, &quot;says Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The trick did not succeed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Первокурсник at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, which he studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter fascist pigs. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contagious. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students picked his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was worn, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;as the Conservatives have sex?&quot; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;They beat each other, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Am I ever to live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Whether I&apos;m forced to hide their true beliefs and become a лейбористкой? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years I have seem hell, full of loneliness and persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He hated Thatcher not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser on foreign policy issues and one of her speechwriters. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In college he almost never appeared. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and partisanship Marxist-детерминистскому view on history. </seg>

<seg id="2477"> I told my father that hate Oxford and explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He didn&apos;t believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in 1940 there were any political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best university in the world,&quot; he said dismal. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;There is no will, not only in the city of dreaming spires. </seg>

<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes помутнели. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Don&apos;t take any hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I believe that this is just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You разобьешь my heart, if left the university. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was изнурена regular trips to London and my emotional defense weakened. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a conservative, not withstood the pressure and abandoned their beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history quite seriously described me as &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In the shower сгорая shame, I confessed that &quot;I brainwashed the brains of the parents,&quot; and called them &quot;the old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Respite was short. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to score my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time he wrote every week on two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>

<seg id="2496"> When they left, I gathered my suitcase and sat in the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me плаксой and cloth. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years no one should become the target of such intimidation and anger in educational institutions. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The worst that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers of the Tories, but also to the present day beneath an undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence. </seg>

<seg id="2577"> &quot;поработаю more than acceptable English for two more years, because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or round in the hotel, but instead he performs work mules. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Dividing up a wooden hut with other носильщиками, he rises every day within two hours of the night, because sulfur is evident at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging shadows, анто descends into the crater, covering a small lantern подсоединенным road to his каске, which he bought for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters drag basket with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, the mining company not механизировала sulfur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам, who work at their own expense and with such deprivations. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they are not even part of the collection of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the picture, which, along with the input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with his people and tourists who come to photograph a volcano-mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for cattle, but not for the people,&quot; says бадрусин, chunky 42 years, the Porter, who spent three decades at кавах иджене, ever since he left college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Can raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that will tolerate job &quot;as much as you can,&quot; because he needed the money for the education of his three children aged from 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Do not go into retirement, die here, because my whole life is a volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burn the throat and hum eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains to his severe illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, the pain in his knees and sores on his shoulders, which деформировались under the basket. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, унайник now can only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano that three truck transport to the warehouse in тамансари, overcoming the distance at 18 kilometers along the narrow path among Chu. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; says унайник, widely opening his mouth, in which is missing a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, older, more than 30 years, also operates a sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do human mules with иджена кавах. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blame career, stress and education and housing prices in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;Singapore&apos;s population is growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I&apos;m a Patriot, a husband, you&apos;re my wife патриотка, make our civic duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> May seem incredible that these lines are part of advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - is the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying such as &quot;let&apos;s suppose Bao (булку) in the stove,&quot; to laugh fertility in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH&apos;s advertising agency, which has made this video, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising in the tabloid form, they will be able to draw attention to the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to people with &quot;its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government tried to do a lot, for example, to launch the spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why don&apos;t we make the most creative thing from possible, to solve this problem, namely compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who don&apos;t take it so lightly, so that the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $1,300 per year on policy for the citizens&apos; enthusiasm for the birth of a greater number of children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The package provides up to $15,000 for a child, extend maternity leave and provide tax breaks for married couples and parents. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is rich and high-tech state-city in southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management on the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the replacement rate - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Population Management, says that the reason &quot;improved education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities of life, apart from the wedding and the creation of a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms boosted the number of births and marriages холостяков and postponement, resulting in the birth rate has declined in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which focuses on the sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> There are Web sites in Singapore, where thrives barely concealed resentment in respect of many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which is criticized for maintaining salaries at a low level and to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration is also seen as one reason that in the past year, Singapore&apos;s ruling party has received the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> The unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in fertility has known the impact on the nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to built not so much of a small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it began to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> A guide on urban development went to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments with 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote холостому lifestyle and deprive incentive housing developers who want to build a big family. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of this company El developers, says that their &quot;boxes of shoes sold much faster than the more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash earnings increase. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, which previously suffered embarrassment, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too перенапряженные </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after a conversation with сингапурцами, who work in the financial quarter center, it seems, that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are overstretched, housing costs, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it,&quot; says a young administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it&apos;s important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as factors that discourage them to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, no matter how the government tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in terms of childbearing, remains the last word for сингапурцами. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Personal offline - personal online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about the &quot;sphere of privacy or private property, which have the right to be protected from any interference.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> That is personal for minor under the age of 16? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> As he uses this definition in their everyday lives and in the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Whether he understands the danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which certainly would not have shared outside of the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Elperiódico has interviewed five guys from 10 to 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases they associated with the term &quot;something very good,&quot; in a private jet, and &quot;the username and password,&quot; when used it to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My greatest secrets, I wouldn&apos;t be downloaded in the post,&quot; says a 10-year Jorge, when trying to explain the personal accounts on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he had for the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;This is very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB I загружаю beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Also I play with their friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I would not have shared a photo, which is not mine, or someone who behaves silly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy realizes that bad publishing obscene photographs of people of crimes or write fierce or derogatory comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assures that knows 35 in FB friends that he has, and nine of their фолловеров on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most of them relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother of the course, she has a password to one accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I started Twitter to express themselves and to write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know whether I answer, I only their загружаю,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networking is fun, I can talk to their friends or relatives overseas rapidly,&quot; he points out. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Without question, answers that never would have accepted a request from незнакомого faces. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> It would not be with someone who would recommend the stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> A 14-year-old Jose case is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager have opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space, and ask, and in the latter recognizes that doesn&apos;t know 20 people, added to his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It doesn&apos;t scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he points out. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in confidence and not requested his home address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I become pressure or demand, simply remove them from your account,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy is certainly the experience of what is now known as кибермоббинг. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> One acquaintance of my girlfriend шантажировали in the social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> He threatened and extorted money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never found out who it was,&quot; he assures. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, not removed an account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;only included confidentiality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a safe manner. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, the boy would have downloaded photos acquaintances in uncomfortable or конфузных situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would have done it, if people don&apos;t like me, or if I like it. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that this кибермоббинг,&quot; he confirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Марьелос поррас, преподавательница English and an expert on education and training, believes that, to guide children and teenagers, need to understand that the goal of social networks - inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Поррас indicates that master Pedagogy of Yale University and the author of labor, academician Mark пренски digital immigrants and Aborigines, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They digital Aborigines, children and young people, who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He said that the issue is difficult, &quot;because we have certain criteria and ask them what you can or can&apos;t distribute, publish or speak, in the age of maturity isn&apos;t enough for this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;also they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, is to ask the questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;We are talking to them, so they didn&apos;t do this, useless,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then поррас lists some options: there are things that you wouldn&apos;t have told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would like it, if you like that published a photograph published you about your friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that other postings about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign photos with partying, ask whether you permission from other people, to mark them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more thing, everyone should know that you do in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to make them understand that they must behave online just as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;beyond the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social networking sites should be,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Эстуардо гуардия, professor of primary education, the university lecturer and consultant on education, explains the need for the heads of families faithfully read policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> &quot;Every one of the items, they have good reasons for talking with children about perceptions of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what to publish or distribute,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the гаурдия, the key question is to remind the kids a lesson &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The UNASUR summit ends without disclosure лимской declaration </seg>

<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the problem of asylum, granted Assange since June in эквадорском embassy in London, through the provision of the guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Sweden, the UK and European courts, and stressed that the talks were in London for solving prison of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We don&apos;t negotiate about human rights, that we in this case does not use the word, but were continuing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution is in the hands of Sweden, the UK and European courts, because Assange&apos;s lawyer, бальтасар Garzon, leads a number of processes in different European courts,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And argued that &quot;if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, will Senor Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or will it on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, lies and bad faith &quot;that distort the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2781"> The death rate from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Фабрицио was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I like оглушили,&quot; he recalls the difficult, despite the whole cycle of the doctor, the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> To cope with the disease on its own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43-th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Фабрицио - one of the &quot;oldest&quot; HIV patients at the hospital Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), where he came in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the past 22 years. &quot;in the early 1990s in too little, it would be hard to believe existed treatment options, too little is known about the disease, too biased treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security does not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had such&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those times have AIDS was a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without worsening the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;истощил their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, after the first alleged cases, &quot;it is a great achievement for the moment at least, that the survival of patients who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV department of hCG, Jaime Andrade вильянуэва, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade вильянуэва explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system in patients with early diagnosis, with a projected life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4 count, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In a nutshell, this means that whoever gets diagnosed HIV-positive in 25 years of age, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, will be able to live up to 75 years without any problems,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess this progress, Mexicans should remember that life expectancy today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients died in a national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and already registered 187 deaths by May of this year, however, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> &quot;Why there is still a lethal outcome? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I should imagine, as well as the situation in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least for the past 12 years, we haven&apos;t had a shortage of the drug, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don&apos;t know about his инфицированном condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He cited the devastating data: &quot;nine out of ten patients come when, already have some оппортунистическую infection; what we need to do, to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who asked it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like фабрицио, who turned to a private laboratory for testing purposes, побужденный only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma капоши, cancerous tumor, which is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are dead, and didn&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Time will still die, the better I&apos;ll надираться three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, well I питаюсь, doing exercises, take drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I am, I&apos;ve got a lot of class, I travel, am active sex life, but with the mutual responsibility, care about themselves and about the other person,&quot; listed фабрицио, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to prompt his statement in the context of World AIDS Day, those now feel fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let проверятся, if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so much better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that can live like any other man, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> The big gap between programs in health care and the ordinary citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of the city of Guadalajara believes that a problem with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places, dedicated to this task, &quot;actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we have one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to your condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why are you?&quot; is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation from the pharmacy staff, school counselors, social workers and health care workers, who don&apos;t want to hear the teenagers, assured advocate. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> That change is inefficient distribution; that condoms were not just come and that more than a hundred of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often visits the youth. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It&apos;s not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It&apos;s not about payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether the distribution of condoms is possible under his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It&apos;s not sexy, it&apos;s best to make condoms available for those who practice sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key figures in халиско </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Registered 13,435 total cases (12,158 1,317 HIV and AIDS). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state ranks 4th place in the national ranking in total and new cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV. </seg>

<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as well as the one registered case is from 4 to 5 people who don&apos;t know about it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the United States court decisions that elides debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script sets no precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problem. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedure for the survival of firms that make Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The approval of the decision, the ruling on June 15, the practical field judge харлин Hale in the bankruptcy court for the Northern District of Texas, has threatened the Mexican firms face possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the ruling opens the door a glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, causing three inconsistencies in the evidence. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> The first section includes the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, for this purpose was created a model law the unification of the UN International Trade Law, identifying as an arbiter of American Institute of Law. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an election, recognized as a critical mass of competitive production of the debt, which had branches in front of the parent company Vitro, would not be achieved the majority needed for approval of its restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> This opportunity, however, recognize the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme will be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are a half-dozen examples, among whom agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose межфирменные debts guaranteed federal institute competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> True also that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or another Vitro creditors, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds &quot;vultures&quot; like aurelios capital, aurelios convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have reached the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> These data omits the appellate court. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which she has since 2008, affected serious economic crisis, which the United States настиг, stabbing across the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> So far the firm of the Gonzalez family garden would appeal to the Court of Appeals that the vote came to the plenum, i.e., the five judges, in view of the fact that only three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the other case will be charged a petition for an identity that will require a review process by the Supreme Court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worse yet, the court rejected the document, directed by the Mexican government in the role of a &quot;friend of the court&quot; amicus curiae (), in which described the process, which should Vitro within the framework of the law on competitive industries, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by the two countries, to tie it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy. </seg>

<seg id="2875"> Баямон in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, starting in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old performances in the role of an agent or co-agent contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager. </seg>

<seg id="2887"> By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements минси in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we got fourth place and it was supposed to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, said Reyes. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the game plays with that in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that we won bronze at the World Championships. </seg>

<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now they travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary. </seg>
