<seg id="1"> Obama&apos;s election of a Republican strategy of resistance </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies to combat spin in the election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the center of the brennana believe the myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strikes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By the same lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is why most state governments with the 2009 law uslozhnyayushchie, the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the election in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only one 2011 was taken by 180 of the laws that restrict the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyayut right voter registration on the day of the will and take away the right to vote with the citizens, have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the election of 2006, no American state does not require voters to present identification documents with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years, they initiated bills requiring voters to present photo ID in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal ID, as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people who have reached the voting age have no identity card with a photograph, issued by the government of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012, have no such document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters considered voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use an identity card with a photograph issued by their educational estab-lishment. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to use for voting certificates issued by the club. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no olginskaya required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time a similar requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, uprazdnyayushchie voter registration on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction has not gone without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the list of about 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time measures taken since 2009, led to a fall in 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were afroamerikantsami, although the last was only 13% of the total number of voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> With only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike belikh, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, zakonodateli-demokraty and their supporters actively opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills was vetirovano gubernatorami-demokratami. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most ambiguous laws was suspended with the intervention of the attorney general of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has partly to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules are in effect, of course, zatrudnyat exercise of the right to vote in the election of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats denounce bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report of the Center brennana from 2011 demonstrates that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, a test of RVA gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegativnye and sometimes lzhepozitivnye that lead to bespoleznomu medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctant to begin to doubt that mass, is from even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In research conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among groups of investigational, however received data difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time European found different levels of mortality in those patients who were screened, and those who do not pass. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, after a 12-year old observation that the likelihood of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who were not screened. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, I would recommend to pass the test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men also are at higher risk of African-American descent. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key point is the right decision, once cancer is detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive and vyalotekushchim. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to clarify the extent of his cancer risk of the disease, offering him the options, without the mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, who have detected cancer, will not run the course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and pose no threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will begin treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we precisely define criteria for deciding who should or should not be a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of test on RVA. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (as in English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: HTTP://ca. Com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening Movember. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no chudo-retsepta to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all the people were nice and quite moving, 30% Rako cases could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;if no one smoked, this figure would rise at least 50%,&quot; said Andrè bolje, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of Cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It causes enormous damage to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said spokesman Andre bolje. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Promising fact: ten years after the refusal of smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Counterbalancet </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas and esophagus, uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; add to the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Association also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> To avoid the sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Shutdown of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the last may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explained in the association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies is clear. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to an SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In an assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr Beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and family history is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;the analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Bozon Higgs in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer, a message that scientists may be able to detect Bozon Higgs, caused a real boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this Bozon explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the standard model, our best, or, in any case, &quot;less imperfect&quot; descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter - but which have never before been found experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But phisycs are not fully confident that it is precisely about the Bozone Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that she is reminiscent of the Bozon Higgs predicted the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week at a single major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed to be sure, although some of the data still lacks. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same, that it is a Bozone Higgs, because the chances of mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world of one law is inevitable, said that two things may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way around this rule, not even try too hard, otherwise navredite himself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: the principle of exceptions Pauli, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;kvantovom state&quot; is a &quot;state&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Based on this phisycs, padaloto particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, which sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> On the other hand scurrying around bozony, the gang of anarchists, who have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can prespokojno be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the site, by the way, absolutely extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these bozony are, in turn, into two groups: mezony, about which we are here to say we will not, and &quot;particles,&quot; through which forces are the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is Bozon Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same bozony, it should be noted, not all such exotic creatures, as one would think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read the Chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal: fotonu bozonu chastitse, or &quot;lightworkers,&quot; which is &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle with electrical charge is accelerating or changes direction, it &quot;violates&quot; the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violations&quot; born electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a fotonom - and, therefore, one of the bozonov &quot;vectors of power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> A more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same thing happens with bozonom Higgs, with the only difference being that, to this Bozon appeared, should be &quot;violated&quot; another field, the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his aunt, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was about the zamerzshem prude, the surface of which could move only very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated by CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km away! - to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the relationship between bozonom and mass of the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, himself never will be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs: those who interact with masses, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what can bring &quot;all of these studies, asks Ms Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used to test whether the standard model (cm2), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts see. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Besides, some of them passionately wanted to this divergence was found, because the slightest inconsistency may open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oj-oj!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But as long as the CERN such conflict is not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it isn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="138"> (see: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research laboratory in Bell could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They envisioned their applications in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory of Bell, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impuljsnymi) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a &quot;laboratory gadget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, there may be a tool for the accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor light. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, though this was not at all of its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> In the Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should quickly resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Yet in this very important area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;debt&quot; tried to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the monterezhi. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, razrushavshij it from the inside, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived for seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house viktor-gadbua belёj in palliative care, which came on the eve of the. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;but this is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees that he helped to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Bodritsya he even manages to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, do it in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in a death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;my greatest desire to cure me from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours after staff found the cure for this malaise. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;in the course of life teaches us that a man must urinate standing,&quot; said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway-house viktora-gadbua. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the status of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;it all depends on the person&apos;s ability&quot; to come to terms with the rebound, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliativnym care sluchayayutsya important events and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come in palliative shelter viktor-gadbua, all cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="166"> The forecasts were taken to a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses provides no more aid, called &quot;therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has enabled me to know their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in life,&quot; she says, before you allow to put her mask, oblegchayushchuyu breathing.. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She will continue in the coming days, the last visit of his son, come back from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the runaway-house viktor-gadbua with the help of volunteers provide body care and assistance in nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which is when you cannot do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11,700 people account for one place in the institutions of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether the comfort of physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we agreed to provide rotovye wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks for. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We don&apos;t force more diabetics to control blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought beer Mr. H., who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son dopitj this beer in feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;we help the relatives, as well as patients,&quot; said Natalie savart, director of patient care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the runaway-house viktor-gadbua no one day is not similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Near the 93-letnim old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovashij everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;in the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; said Dr a Christian Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken to the shelter viktor-gadbua, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, you have to care that is available to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the runaway-house. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as the runaway-house viktor-gadbua and the Society of palliative care at home of Montreal are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care to fear the law, legaliziruyushchego evtanaziyu and assistance in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, circulates a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfurom mauntom and Dr. Bernard lyapuantom and evidence about their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Christian Martel, Quebec&apos;s health system is not enough to secure the right to palliative care quality will be resolved before the transition to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, &quot;I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists till the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my onkologu that I&apos;d stop treatment, she said she was sorry that I&apos;d stop the fight, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> It I said that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> An all-powerful care not </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanks to the medical staff, for what they have not complied with their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the struggle with the pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to the ELSI Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to obezbolivaniyu in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or constantly. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Cannot be more than to pretend that we don&apos;t know about these suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want me spent evtanaziyu,&quot; meaning &quot;I want me became easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The establishment of this report was made possible thanks to a grant from the Research Institute of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for building roads, building contractors, collectors of political parties and specialists on the Italian Mafia day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot; oputyvayushchej construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;the industry is very expensive,&quot; which cost taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;it&apos;s curious how this system breaks down after they were put in the case of all funds, Mr Jacques dyusheno, the deputy police chief and former Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011 caused a scandal as a result of the investigation of official misconduct, with dorozhno-stroiteljnymi contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean ball, agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;the report dyusheno&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one ministry of transport would save $1 billion in contracts,&quot; if some withheld their instincts to take share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The commission Charbonneau &quot;has already shifted its two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that it will &quot;open the scheme behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Uninterrupting unit to combat corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The podklyuchilosj was created in 2011 uninterrupting unit to combat corruption, which includes extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, members of the special unit &quot;hammer,&quot; which after 2009, forced to &quot;waste&quot; Montreal, to stop the cartel inflated the value of the contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, there has been a series of seachers, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco Zampino and risharu markottu - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> On the line - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired from his post as mayor of lavalya, the third largest city in the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> His neodnokratnom suspected of receiving bribes in awarding government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, the indictment was charged several engineers to service routes Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony akkurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last blew up a bomb, told investigators about the &quot;system&quot; of government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Within a few years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contract in Montreal, a facilitator, connected with the Mafia, which in turn transferred money Party mayor zheraljda Tremblay &quot;joint Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000&apos;s Zambito spend money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) various parties of the province, mostly liberals, was then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that he was illegally collected funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts, in which zavyshali cost </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; corruption was trouble-free. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles syurprenan, a former engineer for civil construction, detailed described her before the panel: in the ten years he received from construction companies in the travel, gifts and invitations to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on matches in hockey and bribes in a total of 736.000 dollars in exchange for a sewer contracts, the value of which he overestimated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that they had received on the leg, zavyshaya account for 30-40% with the help of fake additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer from the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, napolnyavshego party cash-box dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November by immersion Montreal into a deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, zabivshih anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of Okrug rivière-de-preri in the east of the island, she counters with the 2010 sale of the minicipal plot, purchased for 5 million dollars and pereprodannogo... for 1.6 million developers at the height of the building boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She said that the investigation, which will be launched in the end, she pulls the plug, &quot;to understand the system, kishashchuyu Muraviev, to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process it harakterezuet as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will establish its own investigation team and the obsever to avoid the return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we ubiraemsya at home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques dyusheno notices for his part that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but especially his worry about the role of &quot;elected officials who knew about this scheme,&quot; but not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: &quot;they told me that this was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec offers to limit to 100 dollars of donations to parties, but, he said, it would not change the situation: &quot;until we will strictly limit election spending, in politics will be dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing parties: &quot;we can&apos;t go below; hardily examine the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr dyusheno calls on those laughs, look in your own yard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season of you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual soznateljnostjyu, but can - and a new dimension of the Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profits of great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I grew up next to them every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also brought a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t raspalyayusj. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the start in the centre of the prior training in NIF in klerfontene and to my parish in sant-étienne I always Chagall forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you will benefit from the competition by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer is not new in deposits to play matches in a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that a player as I want to be at the level and the place to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He help such hotarirea as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position, that I have. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Carlo Ancelotti, the owner of the position? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect across the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the first League he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with top clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was a obnadezhivayushchaya conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I wandered away from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I trust that he has also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the first league leader Lyon took our place. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in the 1/8 Finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to say their word face to face with very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First we want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a return match in one in eight finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG will become the first European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has to do this already have the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure the position for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the Paris St Germain have the resources to do this project Realschule. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the first league as last season, will be a failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great frustration. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we invalidated ardently wish to get the world title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were this close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are completely ready to do. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Trua and we still find criticized for that, of course, it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what people expect from us first. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We do not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement the project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which has two season fails to pass in the 1/8 Finals, although they have spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount we were 15 points ahead of the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be a disdain for our opponents to championship and France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows how exciting the first league. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So what if they say that there is a &quot;zlatanozavisimostj.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that ibragimovich is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first league. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done, it really is. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you survived the Euro 2012 team from France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I earnestly desired to participate in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw there many things, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play good qualifier matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped since my krikštą in blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and should now behave model. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first month of Didier deshama at the head of the blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They advance for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in qualifying for the group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He is a coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had reached its goal, he qualified us in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> A good honored draw (1-1) had on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of the banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on a tsentrobankah, numbered transactions between receiving the commission fees on their treatment. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), at the same time is the virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure protocol by the type of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between the members of one level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take bitkojny for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The bitkojna, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before to return today about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts. Com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing out of the ordinary in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes bitkojn as &quot;the most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as &quot;loans&quot; used to advance in a video game, which are made in the course of the game or who will buy (and sometimes exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But exchange operations always controls and processes of any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Bitkojn in all parts of the network are at the same time, the holders of the company&apos;s financial books, auditors, Policy Exchange, pokupatelymi and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each deal between two users actually occurs between two electronic addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new paymenta user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information relating to this transaction, signed by e-mail, using a system with a double-pat encryption key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network also can check the authenticity of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the file content may check that bitkojny used in the deal, really exist in public accounting book, razoslannoj across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A key hurdle is check-in/a new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It runs through the mathematical tasks, razoslannoj computers, to which, like a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a Phase-II file that is hashing conversion of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers take &quot;a new transaction and add to her room before the&quot; heshirovatj &quot;all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many hash-value in the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number is found, other sites easily check that it properly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction thus nerarzryvno is associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If to cheat the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wish to pay twice the one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unproved, as they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, the task gets 50 bitkojnov. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitkojnov in circulation, however limited to 21 million, but they delimy to one stomillionnoj that leaves another reserveg. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task also increases with the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites that provide services Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;the defect does not apply to the protocol,&quot; notarizes Pierre nuaza, who recently launched paymium - the company osushchestvlyayushchuyu plăţi real money using a network of Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported about the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the money also enjoy this disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as blog-platforma WordPress, their permit. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron vejtsmana from the Institute in Israel, analyzed the book and found that almost 80% of bitkojnov are not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;the huge sell-off&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; Jon holmkvist, who works in the ifarahon coinabul, which is the conversion bitkojnov in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre nuaza, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) beskontaktnogo or paymenta via mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to verify the transactions, which thus is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner of the better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new hardware or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough to tell the address, which can be &quot;photograph and recognize&quot; telephone, says Pierre nuaza, to assure that he has already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;before the Bitcoin established, it will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to a variety of risks, is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have gone from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What&apos;s next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, without relying only on us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> From the US suffered mainly Afghan peasants, which we saw as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we will, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennymi. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commander of the fugitives in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign forces, as it did with the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They are tolerated, they sometimes help local insurgents, but more of them will not be as only the West will behave more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Withdrawal of French troops from the base of the nidzhrab, which I watched from the heights of the nadiža zasazhennyh almond trees due to the French credit, took place in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters have reached Kabul, not being atakovannymi. </seg>
<seg id="411"> With the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not be. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their irresistible brawlote from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women paid for bigotry of these peasants in which their surpassed Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under building immigrants, returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American subpodryada contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not from thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave as left those who managed the American generosity: a capital outflow. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now has 5 million people, one fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in cities in both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to any mrakobesiyu old parties, nor the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment, the Army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Old commanders, vedshie anti-Soviet struggle, already taking measures to restore provincial milícias, which would not be subject to the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, Gornaya country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain extent detsentralizovan, on the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the election, targeted for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country since the 1950s, and even before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> The industry was not put on the legs, no dam does not function, no irrigatsionnaya system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is made, in addition to fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by decades of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to grab. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without the energy to process iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, no mineral production. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already almost left copper deposit ajnak months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig into a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employer province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It is also to one day by the Afghanistan and Pakistan from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20. </seg>
<seg id="444"> A new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: liceum for girls, for boys, faculty of the French language in the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, in an effort to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and do the impossible task of combining aid from offensive operations, the &quot;voenno-grazhdanskoj activities&quot; at the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC uprazdnennaya) in 2012, together with a small French public organization contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, with an intense involvement of local labor, could help to contain the uprising, irrigation, Wells, drinking water, restoring forests, fruit-trees, protection of soils and increase in the arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> That we leave for the memory of himself, spending two billion euros on military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget it would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, is often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural work, coming from the local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To get rid of the rukovodimyh foreign groups, which want to farmers, as they told me, you need to give them a small nevoennuyu support, which would be good to do would be to them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> The difficult birth of Egypt&apos;s constitution </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all-in. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Exactly a week ago, the head of the state provided the two additional months to finish the job. </seg>

<seg id="723"> Through the work of ticket-office at McDonald&apos;s is up to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last days of America wave of protests against low wages in the Department of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, &quot;&quot; tacos Bell, &quot;&quot; uendis &quot;and&quot; Kentucky there chiken. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one is predicting, whether this will be a wave in the ninth shaft or she is played out in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, the organizer of the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> While this sector of the economy almost not immersed in the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, in the so-called &quot;black Friday,&quot; when on America crumbled orgy of cheap sales, now millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied by potasovkami. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of Walmart, which worldwide employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and piketirovali together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops of the corporation, whose product designed for people on modest and middle incomes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> However many nizkooplachivaemye employees of Walmart come only in their work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Availabillity and range of goods to Walmart, one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of poor working conditions, for example, on the shortage of lift trucks or handheld scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; required to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Average employee Walmart to 9.5 dollars per hour, these costs can not afford, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase srednuyuyu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation in 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is about 1.1% more than it spends on a salary now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entirely perelozhit wage growth on the shoulders of the buyers, every visit to the shop will do them only on 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of the Walmart rather note that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not cause damage or malejshchego Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash machines produced in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The Corporation&apos;s spokesman Dan Fogelman said in an interview with The Huffington Post website that Jobs left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just &quot;another piarovskim gimmick&quot; to its trade union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;free ticket-office!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where their object were not department stores Walmart (them in this progresif city are not favour, and therefore they are not), and &quot;makdonaldsy&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that, he even does not give you the hospital and not pay you for an honest job! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumejn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At this point, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7,25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants with the time it increase, but not much, and their average employees receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less of them in this expensive city earns no one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can you be in New York for the money, for me the incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through the &quot;makdonaldsy&quot; was almost a quarter of American teenagers, who worked for their shelves after school, living with parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few who saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, I have encountered in an interview with employees of &quot;makdonaldsov,&quot; who complain that must live on that salary and sometimes even to feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal hangeth coments, the author of which notes that irresponsible to get children, if you don&apos;t know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald&apos;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and povaram fast food system began to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, that is more than double their current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the fast food were created by the trade-unions organization. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the administration of the trade union movement to prevent and punish activists harassed and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to reach the fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main extraordinary turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Disagreements </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day, and a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the shares appeared in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald&apos;s near Times Square, which featured several local, in particular, a member of the City Council, dzhumejn Williams, insisted: McDonald&apos;s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for honest work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, insisted that &quot;we must all join in support of fast food workers so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every njyu-jorkets!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> What was characterized as the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But there were only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which tens of thousands of people employed in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether this will spark the flames of the mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;until it is medium&quot; to deceive the brain </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology the augmented reality has recently been seen largely through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First in the summer at their annual conference of the model showed Google, and then, in November, it became known that the application for a patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from a conversation with the director of the interactive 3D technology in Microsoft sharamom Izadi kembridzhskoj laboratory for scientists should be that the company points - the stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It is the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> &quot;tell me, please, in general terms, what does your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;we are human interactions with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While stuck in the mass of humanity on the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanjya in their fingers. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting zhestovoe management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what else awaits us ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> &quot;despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, much still is on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The information has improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including proektivnyh. </seg>
<seg id="787"> You need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> &quot;what do you think about the voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but not overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> &quot;it is definitely not a panacea - a question of privacy because they don&apos;t always want to notify people about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the management of the devices in public places we have projects in the framework of which we thought gestures, but not over swinging, and over such short, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not digicam devices, and naruchnym bracelets, which recorded the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> While he is a big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristop hours. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general the future for mixed management, for example, gest+golos. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;it&apos;s like? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - for example, how do you ask me to give you this bank for? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say, and at the same time show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> &quot;I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> &quot;Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - that is, you want to get users to adapt under what may or may not be at this time machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> &quot;it is not necessary, but it is the mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think in the near future we mostly have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will determine the possible reaction of man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;if we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you have claims to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lack of permission or something? </seg>
<seg id="810"> &quot;in principle, the current generation is what can make a start in our work on trivariate recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 with the speed of 1,000 k/s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it&apos;s not in the megapikselyah, and as the Matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the latest point of view of all current technologies are not good enough for us - it adds the work of designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is necessary to remember not only about the resolution of the x and y axes, but Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Flat-125-5 is also very important, the frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movement of people is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen betishes of our redmondskoj laboratory to touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) Index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of humans and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work very useful equivalent of such devices, but does not require it to be a frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - and the number of cameras to increase not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - in the Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually infrared emitter and the second receiver bounced signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And now the third ostava is, in fact, a sensor visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of settlings. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, poigratjsya with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in 3-D definion provisions. </seg>
<seg id="827"> &quot;as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You don&apos;t think in terms of daily use technology augmented reality glasses - it is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;of course, walk all the time, holding a smartphone in their hands, not very convenient, but that&apos;s what I think: the steep option would be to&quot; augmented reality &quot;on the basis of the cloud platform, when you could switch from points on the smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Skill-points is a very personal device, in that their strength (private things only see you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual golograficheskimi objects in the air is not only Tony starku of&quot; Iron Man, &quot;but an ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often show critics of this idea: not touched by the recall! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands don&apos;t feel! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing for the challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is seventh in the breakthrough in the interaction of people and machines. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth may well be additive taktiljnyh sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a kind of a substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It&apos;s great to you! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is technology, which is really aimed at giving this &quot;pictures in the air&quot; osyazaemosti - for example, interference at a certain point of the Rays, with a finger, gives a sense of, but it still very weak, as if poduli are on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;and you tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;this is a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task on which will fight for a long time - how to make a person is physically very limited, to believe that he is open, almost infinite - working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not such as the clubs), moving platforms, as well as the huge Sharov. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While the brain is either a fool, work is still very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things in a rudimentary level. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Instead of culture - vkusovshchina&apos;s Rosbalt. </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;st.-petersburg avangarde,&quot; dedicated to city dwellers, who are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this top-spisok bright figures have already entered art-stseny peterburga, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the nationwide fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;rosbalta&quot; - epatazhnyj artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The entire town knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all krasnoye, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable parties and vernisage. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Pictures of Miller always collect crowds, wherever they are. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of a st.-petersburg sotsialjno-filosofskih skazochnikov, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright man st.-petersburg avant-guard in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, the Man City, their appearance in the streets of the smile for citizens, to the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently he took sharmanku in the hands of Petersburg and became sharmanshchikom as ripe for this complex role of all of its bogemnym existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, and why are you still walk around the city in the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose red as the designer, who has a view and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, imidzhmejkerom and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society all that a bit not Gray, causes aggression and fomentation of the malign properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations directed to begin the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;and when you realized that there should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> &quot;the exhibition at the theater, where the nevskaya were exposed to my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and the new, volne like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with artists of the new wave, with postgazonevshchinoj, which led to the &quot;pushkinskoj-10,&quot; and more waves was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I get in the theatre, the clothes, the music of all genres, in addition to words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> &quot;all of this has been united in your art-klinike...&quot; I was important experience in the center of the culture of peterburga, where should meet all of the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took territory at pushkinskoj-10, and there, there was no repair, there was a muzykaljno-artisticheskij Club, a bohemian Club, home of the st.-petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were born: nomy, tekila-dzhaz, remember, as a string led with the project &quot;the ear of van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord, and his friends sang under the veneer light song, they were obtyagivayushchem tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band played live, she became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was a leading many programs to hali-galivskih times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them trahtenberga, and went his great career and basic education and upbringing he we have received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Palatstso &quot;Dmitrii 9,396,&quot; griboed club &quot;is the echoes from the art-kliniki. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our employees and regulars are gone. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I hero of yesterday&apos;s century, when the culture of something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was &quot;people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the category of &quot;Artist of the year&quot; was named I ended my climax. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not much cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> &quot;your work is recognizable sérieux. </seg>
<seg id="884"> &quot;many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and sharpness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have the software exhibition, &quot;the Russian Museum in klounah.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Expo-center - the timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used to be so social was now is painful and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the klounah all razmazyvaetsya, the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have groteskovye ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world by dressing in the form of totalitarianism. </seg>

<seg id="895"> It is me, they will. </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;well may and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet. </seg>

<seg id="906"> And on cultural grounds of 300 people will come and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end, less management, money, all languish. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the important thing is they don&apos;t fool, not spoil won. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote the pictures in his youth, that they have one collector on the wall next to the faljkom and Larionov hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: the culture of the spiritual, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Cyril st.-petersburg lacks? </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a notion: official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not every one of them can do culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the right of all is not as it was, the Kings, may not really understand the culture, but they felt the need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have in st.petersburg people have, which could be experts, but they are pushed as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and will give them the road. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now the vkusovshchinka flourishes. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who must seek to other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> &quot;what&apos;s for you is st.-petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;st.-petersburg is not a cultural capital of culture, in Moscow, there is far more of the soil. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones of art to grow hard. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Here in Europe are a lot of people who go to curious exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have this thin layer. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented on the grant of st.-petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with the asteroidom-ubijtsej. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space ships with zemlyanami on board go in search of extra planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, there is the question of how to continue their race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets, which can be managed at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;it&apos;s Venus and Mars,&quot; said a senior fellow at the National Institute for Astronomy name P. K. Sternberg (Gaish) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if Mars conditions more suitable for life, then the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century ago conducted experiments on the plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then create in the orbit of the tiny insects, muh-drozofil sporophores. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, the space was sent to check perepelok eggs, as a developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get on an absolutely normal young bird. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But away from the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;the problem with the fact that this nestling should find support, he should get back on its feet and start moving,&quot; explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours of newborn was full of atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that through the four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible there with them to work,&quot; said the failure of the experiment with the ptentsami in space Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time with animals biological &quot;minikovcheg&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, on the biosputnike &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> It was an experiment with mice that were sent into space, already with a fetus. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there weren&apos;t opgedeeld. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;it&apos;s just been on the biosputnikah, but again, this is a unique experiment, and such research you need to do,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But approach the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, losing the habitat, simply may not realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, in contrast to the zveryushka, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create with emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons such experiments are not. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women in space travel for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was at Valentina Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious of humanity, that there is a female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Chayka is, and no one on earth could not say whether he after flying in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether it will be able to give birth to the child after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;because this question no one answered,&quot; said the veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after the first zhenshchina-kosmonavt flight in space, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child Andriyan nickolaev was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman Svetlana Savitskaya, twice visited in orbit and even porabotavshej in an open space, the son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little unit, there are astronauts after long flights, which have all cost, and growing a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;and if more, it is dangerous even in the orbital flights,&quot; concludes the cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, the humanity to look for any new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> He is a gidrolaboratoriya step in preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work on skills in an open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, let the water and warm, but still, the alien environment for infants - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small ihtiandry if confirmed - life on the land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a correlation between what malysh is about 9 months of mom in okoplodnoj fluid, it would help him get used then to vodichke. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;it&apos;s a little something to forget,&quot; says the instructor grudnichkovogo Sailing Marina axenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if children are born to a more natural state, the weightlessness for women - is gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in the weightless dryahleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, drops the ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, skip it, relying on stimulants of labor activity. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, will push it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;then what?&quot; - sets that include voprosy Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, children also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> With no sense of Earth&apos;s gravity, the body does not form a skeletal and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special exercise suit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He will simply be deprived of what he will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;and this experiment, which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to the point that we bring to land a disabled person, completely dezadaptirovannogo,&quot; the head of the Committee for the Bio-and IMBP Igor Pestov of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space - the question of the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after the time it will be a reality, when earthmen on their ships will travel to far-off planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the main kontroljno-revizionnogo management: schwarz-sistemy failed at the hands of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement of the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme kontroljno-revizionnogo management, from an interview for the website aktuálně .cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;the law will never be perfect, but it must be right that, in my opinion, we do not have,&quot; commented on the current situation of Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar conclusion provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices are nechasa st.peter approach to the so-called schwarz-sisteme. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister said that GDP (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb the entrepreneurs -came is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;the law should be in any way, and if it something bans, the prime minister could not resist the institutions, which are required to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations,&quot; states the feces. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in the framework of which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly is it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> A parallel check, meaning that we started, perhaps, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question is that European law says, how should be public procurement, the next national legislation and then also the use of the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> The information was collected and, even with the still unfinished verifcation, revealed the interesting differences - in short, the legislation we have can be &quot;precise and error-free,&quot; but in practice we in certain parameters to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more revised rules, should focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But actually as this project can help you that he does it mean for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> This joint control can contribute in efforts to stop laws, reduce and refine perfectionof restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy means getting appropriate things for reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we achieve this, by lowering the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system perepolnitsya &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if exercitiul not down. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the internal problems of the practical application of the law on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as a system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is there such an organization as our chickens (kontroljno-revizionnoe admonistration) or it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for the institutions, then there as our chickens is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged for our principles, but there is also the board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of the audit and on the level of federal lands - in their system is slightly different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can only control the federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal audit chamber. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation, there is easier than we have? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can&apos;t definitely say that it is better in all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so because they are better at dealing with the control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but once again, such comparisons do not like me. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Speaking about domestic legislation, then as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it still does not appear in our work to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we spend control after the fact, it is necessary to consider some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take it into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have to use our new tool neekonomnosti risk detection, through which we are not up to almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed. There, of course, these changes will come, because changing restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can occur is that the rules of the &quot;uzhestochatsya&quot; and cannot be observed. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules of controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not trade-distorting for a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us realize that this path will lead nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb the entrepreneurs of the so-called schwarz-sistemy. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;schwarz-sistema&quot; is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be in any way, and if it something bans, the prime minister can not resist the authorities, which are expected to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say, &quot;we change the law and allow it,&quot; but this is not to say that we will pretend that nothing is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement contains very stringent rules, like what must formally be conducted, and it is the right thing. This protects the public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of technical problems. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be right that, in my opinion, we do not have. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The road sometimes slippery, but mostly prohodimy. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some places, the Czech Republic road frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> They mostly prohodimy, but in some places with greater caution. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think about that in less than a month should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily popadaemsya. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Together with a group of the tap tap we always joke on the subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to raise enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>

<seg id="1136"> What were the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to make the program, which will attract all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, support lesbiens Chinaski will perform with Dan illustratosphere, Bart, the Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jiri Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> About all of the details can be found on the website www. Kpks .cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you plan any such &quot;grandiose events&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival &quot;Prague Spring&quot; and then, of course, will prepare a programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, as if we are in the US, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you have serious plans, you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logisticses? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members on the electric wheelchairs, their stroller must travel in the cargo hold of, in addition, a large number of cargo and cists with tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, while coping with the Czech čsa airlines without problems. British Airways and British Airways have always been great for us prepared that surprised me how many times. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went off without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the vyezdam abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With than you were at the moment? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, London, Luxembourg and other countries where everything works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared with the Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise independent przesuwanie person on the electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There is also shyrokovzhyvanym such banal things, how to keep out of the way people in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there already are public organizations, who are trying to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And that, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, runlevel which is far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the modification and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people whom it concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe form of disability independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, yes anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are with the tap tap a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public or bezbarjernostj is one thing, but at the moment, when we had the famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as this single cases - people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> A group of the tap tap is currently very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998 forced it to you? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the Institute edlichki as the teacher, around me was a lot of young people who want something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I was a musician and play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, over time, says our lead Ladya angelovič, it&apos;s a bit spun out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I have confused? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we will help that we have started to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, as a matter of fact as if there is no. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the European Union can we afford skilled teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was a goal so well before you turn the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, podrazhayushchej one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, everything new is made with care, and lasts that long. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the man who we see, of course, pity, it is natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this pity is izlishnya, because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all unused personalities, which we should pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live a full life and maturate, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if something happens in people with disabilities, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Whether the success ensured that you strict head of what you believe many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the job properly, we must be in a lot of things hardcore outfit and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I believe that this is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic floorshow and fly in the clouds, and when they hear that twice a week they should walk in rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But as happens in any group that wants to work and something to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the group of the tap tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> As it did in the early in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ladya angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He will be held the day before the end of the world, expected on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will be held at Incheba stadium in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in the club - fléda plynojem - in the centre with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert of all three cities are joined telemostom at the time of the song of the tap tap &quot;the end of the world is cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The objective of the project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kronor for the purchase of equipment for a bezbarjernogo studeo Education Center at edlichki in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children up to 12 years of free admission tickets can be bought in advance at bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European Space Agency as the second country from countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the second world war, Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Recall, for example, about a shternfeljda, who lectures on 6 December 1933 was in Warsaw astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work &quot;introduction to Cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905 R.) left the audience unfazed, after several years of штеrнфельд recalled that only Dr. Jan gadomskij was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 in France shternfeljd won the prize of Robert hesnault-peljtri and Andre Luis hirsha for the &quot;introduction to Cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan gadomskij (1899, 1966), mentioned above, later became the great propagandist of astronomy and space science. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskij became known to the world&apos;s propagandist spaceflight., and his contribution was praised by including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway drezina, equipped with missile engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even to disperse or to pull carts will be used Raketa. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this drezine known only from newspapers of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The study was provided by Section quipment weapons in collaboration with Professor mechislavom voljfke and Gustav mokzhitskim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining materials, you can see that studies have reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the advent of the German army work was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, in the specialized printing of the idea of the photovoltaic rakety-istrebitelya, which offered 28.10.1990 rogozinskij, and the next year was the work of the &quot;airline(s raketa-torpeda&quot; author lelivy-kzhivoblotskogo raketa-bomba and aviation. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects of military use rocket technology was a scientific advisory committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society astronautics (Polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine &quot;problems,&quot; in which published four long articles on astronavtike. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, a professor of mthere subotovich offered to organize a society that will deal with the kosmonavtikoj. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society astronautics (POA) sought to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn POA became its full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the next year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimierz zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the Federation of International Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956 POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful meteorological rocket RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vypolnivshej scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Missile capable of overcoming the distance 1800 meters in length, was about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built the improved version of the rm-1a, and in the summer of 1959 bledovskom to survive was carried out on the two-stage missile rm-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> That rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already able to do this scientific work - Raketa rm-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962 further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The heir of the first missiles of the type of RM Stala Raketa meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Raketa was conceived as we use two level, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> We have developed three types (identified as meteor-1a, -1v and -1s), which is the size of a camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Raketa meteor-1a is the space of 0,4 L meteor-1v, l.lipinska, and meteor-1s - 0.34 - 0,62l. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of flight at all three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute to develop meteor-2 missiles, and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Raketa meteor-2 with the initial weight of 380 kg was able to useful cargo weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then were built versions of meteor-2n and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Should also mention the accession of Poland in kospar (the Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a national kospar committee two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, the programme Interkosmos, Poland took part in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial sattelites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav hermaszewski became the second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remeka. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision has provoked a lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberaljno-orientirovannye economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In fact, this means that separate economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of significant differences in labor costs (salaries) is the price. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this stratifier need to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stem the economic competition in the &quot;misleading&quot; the cost of competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase its own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a mass scale it means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in the countries where the cost of labor, compared with other high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for producing them unemployment, then grow the inevitable government spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In general, the situation is the reluctance of employers to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that need no specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Bestseremonnye methods of private capital to the level of the economies of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially lower the social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected primarily in the change of the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to get its people to obey the dictates of economically private capital, primarily in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool of cuts in workers&apos; rights in the field of labor legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of increased levels of poverty, and with it the difference between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own labor. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the competitiveness of the German economy constantly occur when placed by people receiving such salary that the state they must pay, so they got a living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all southern states of the EU, undoubtedly, lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of the crash or social status, forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or live in the beggarly salary on the margins of society in the hope that someday, in the country&apos;s private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> However, asked where he will undertake? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in its management of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Next, you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> A categorical answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is the existence of a virtually almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result, we have the hopeless situation, proyavlyayushchuyusya in corruption, mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministers due to lack of financial resources to the development of private law firms that are related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then the bill says the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, according to the Constitution of the Western type, and from finansovo-moshchnyh groups, which prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that liberaljno-orientirovannaya democracy now quickly turns in such a situation, as it is described in the works of the appianom &quot;crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies are involved in the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went into the election with zaranee sold voice... &quot;&quot; decent people not at all of them ran for the post of the governor, and, in the end, once the state for eight months to go without konsula&quot;.... &quot;seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose a vigorous man..&quot; Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy on an autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in the public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> It means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Especially tragic is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The decision is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken a monopoly position of private capital in the society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;from the violence does not work, and never could get&quot; - Sting, the &quot;fragile,&quot; with the verse refrena are the words: &quot;don&apos;t forget what we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;if my sons do not want war, they would not be dying - gutelj shnaper amshela Meera, wife of Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, caused many responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing his stance that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, as an act of genocide committed on Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of the terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings, criminal, and who the victim, in the end, today&apos;s Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, look at the who first serve is already 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning by historical facts, some of them withdrawn on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily the story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to advance set goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the international wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power out of them could not happen in the life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the Octopus (I do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> A lot of them not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop rumors linking them with the criminal actions in high places, in the shade of which they were, and that always led to strengthen their power priumnozheniyu wealth or at the same time and to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large shareholdings in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare the war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was just 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country&apos;s central bank in your hands). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of central bank rotshiljdovskim for Bank of America, during the civil war, he started to understand their (government) money - and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their hunger for a world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 year led to the development of the plan three world wars, a great Mason 33rd level Albert pajkom. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for this project) and the seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method by which has a team of the wealthy families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by the murder of Habsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, by Bolshevist revolyutsiiyu. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended with a sudden, untenable in the military and economic relations, the German surrender (there was no longer a need of war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European powers, Austro-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation imposed on Germany huge war reparations, than a precondition to the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the strong enough oblichayushchego perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create the multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of the fifth column in sparking the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> In the late 19th century Rothschilds saw one branch of the Zionist movement, which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>

<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which were the patron of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US administration a positive outcome to the situation - she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard because it is at the root of it could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the teokraticheskogo regime, she was not in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate was at home, the wave of solidarity and antiiranskih sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of the 80s year ended election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>

<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the expert on &quot;evacuation&quot; of Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To be accurate, the legend in specialized magazines wrote about the project, a press conference, the fictional film production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Film affleka is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, real political thriller, the so-called &quot;filjm-kinoopus,&quot; the story of a successful libel action, the scam - example could be a number of films about friends oushena. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film constantly change the mood - on the one hand, documentarily conceived scenes from Tehran (a subtitle shows significant historic photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film - big differences in this not). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, intercross with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - the men in suits discuss the situation for talks on the staircases of institutions on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Bin affleku admirationful managed to make restart career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From the vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule. </seg>

<seg id="1360"> At the same time, this is the first affleka film, which remains in the hometown of the director - Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> A sense of atmosphere places at the same time refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films by the director of the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck it manifests in &quot;Argo,&quot; where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - the opening scene of the fall of the Embassy of impressive clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and nepredvidennosti, which arise when gde-to suddenly changing history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake) headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not suggest a variety of exciting scenes of cinematographic values. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He&apos;s been working with this little, sometimes, something dodumyvaet - there it is not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the chase on the runway look pretty nadumanno). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The disadvantage of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved a larger space, and they are not alone in the film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Film affleka lacks a bit of dramatism, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest in assessing the performance and retro-stil recreating thrillers of the Seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But captures with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how the exaggerated notions about Almighty omniscient and security services. </seg>

<seg id="1393"> The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the amounts of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Organizers of the questionnaire also interested and the idea of some countries to pay for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the application for a subsidy. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;we are at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>

<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered the Ministry for regional development minister Paul rukovodimoe, German (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think about how to become the senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we have in the country all functioned without problems, I would not go for. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I just can&apos;t watch over the past 20 years the country as thieves steal scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like, then try to find a solution, as it is to change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was 40 years old and I independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you hit, but soon went to the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Not so if you turn back to the people that you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that vklyuchusj in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I said that if I am elected senator, would run for president. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> However I need the greatest influence and authority. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not only that we as a nation ropshchem sebja in a bar or watching television, but ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The mass media, which are added to this ochernyayut man, and that confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri paroubeka. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the thesis about material and criminal liability of the politicians and the return of property declarations on the amount above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do it, we need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have as a president such authority is not present, and only a Senate may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> As you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied the tours to become free enterprise, it managed to advance. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is politikanstvo - when someone comes in with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately obstructing, and it curbs citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent, non-partisan person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya on order, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You&apos;re a person, more relevant to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> With the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, not at all important - a bit to the left or a bit to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not that someone refers to the right and the left, someone I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good for society, suggested the decision whether it&apos;s hrcm or GDP, and I just was against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You angry when someone says you populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But not prove whether you are what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you also have any ideal goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And for this you are trying to approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all proposals on which I say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of parliament are just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics, you don&apos;t hold on for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you get to people and talk with them, you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them to his side, so that we have achieved it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, would not take the trouble to organize a direct TV broadcasting, in which I shall refer to the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> In case of failure and they will have to tell why this does not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong person, which will outline the abuse, it will put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Say directly that I like, not a genius and not intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just a beginner in politics, and for its program to obtain the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Things I try to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, through six years of close and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is, in part, it sounds as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one, I did not do, however I bypassed a number of well-known people with an offer run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to radimu yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also, I at least supported a leading investigative journalist Ian lorentsovu, which opened fraud with light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward his candidacy because people really are, but now I feel in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people not gone in elections, and most of those who went selected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Only two of us independent in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential supporters, and I have no money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> No money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twentythousand of CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about the property declarations, and what is your own business with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property estimated at approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague at a cost of about 25 million apartment at 10 million, another apartment on the 8 million art collection, about 10 million to 3.5 million, and Aston-Martin, who has a million, and even a few million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Aston-Martin by the way I had, because it was my maljchishechjya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was courtly with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive on the aston-martinet, own property on the 60 million and you have no money for a campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the Republic, but their own money is not to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I had put into the campaign for 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from his pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on campaign I in fact will cover senatorskaya salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But on the money I wouldn&apos;t have lived, for example, could not pay the son for the English school, which costs 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to make money, so you wouldn&apos;t ran. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> It means, then you will be engaged in business to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Don&apos;t you said that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partly reduced its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like what I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> But, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting every month? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From two to four hundred thousand that to continue. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became president, then his entgerprise would be finished. </seg>

<seg id="1514"> Here is my proposal: &quot;Orgil spejkenisse&quot; in the book, the so-called bukenberg! </seg>

<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but postmodern pedestrian zones and surprisingly homely town hall, white facades which suggest about the molokozavode, became richer on one piece of modern architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But mainly- in the first spejkenisse in the history of this town of public building cultural destination. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: the book Eldorado under the cap for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Here only one elevator, taking place in the centre of mountain-mass, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps accurately create a sense of public town square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is re-established. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Vzglad consiously is looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless,&quot; says Vini Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We set the classical configuration of space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inner space of the book Mountains used skillfully: in the center of the House offices, internet-biblioteka, chess club, ecological center and technical areas. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Particularly pleasing black bookcases, which serve as the building walls, the parapetami, the lestnichnymi railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even experienced architects and civil engineers are lost in wonder, what is the unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;we were eager to work with secondary materials,&quot; explains Jop trauborst, head of the project, representing the community of spejkenisse, in line with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a by-product of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots used artificial fiber material millimetric thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles is one or two of the season, then it can be to throw away. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library this painting - for the first time in such volumes - was spressovano in the thick four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of the heat and the pressure of the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material by the smell, a bit like a new car and a little krossovki. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the lead 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Whoever wins over the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch kroketami clothed and fikus in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity to the literary grief. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Costs of the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;it is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment,&quot; says trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> It is used for heating and cooling of the Earth&apos;s heat. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book phnum standing under the przeszklonym cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Wide-spanning farms of kleenoj Wood, located across glass case, provide shade and take up a large part of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room is very nice. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the protection provides fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, mentioned above skeptic of it, has visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lizette verhajg also was already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as acting coach who both traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which bukenberg called &quot;soul spejkenisse, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were to take the blank space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed library - at the time it was 70,000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves to make up. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;there is nothing worse than the polupustaya library,&quot; said architector Vini Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that our invitation now everyone in some way associated with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the task on the professional jargon is called a icavityities. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spejkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And even if they are young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for building identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the application of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany should be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical toward Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO held this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, and it is moving from the policy, which, so to speak, to us, to the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Additionally, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent edinaya policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans again are between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that while they only find its role, but are on the road to &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The foreign policy, which is France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specifically means &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to its national interest in the position, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests largely differ from those of other large states, and why Germany must defend their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these economic interests have a position in the Middle East conflict and on the UN vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the countries of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> However it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I wouldn&apos;t give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Whether Germany navredila its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I&apos;m sure in Europe and even in the US is an understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> However I do not think that it was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany even will acquire thus a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different views about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The US, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there a divergence of views between the United States and many European states? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In the power of American domestic politics, such differences were always. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But the political situation in connection with the local government, of course, cannot openly to hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences of opinion over is not as significant as it always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not happy with the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> If Germany is to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on one side and the position of important partners in the EU with the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think this is a difficult situation for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there is a neprotivorechivaya, European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> However, they may not be in the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Just as they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that, in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that in Germany it is not easy, even because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This theme was always fine. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player - not whether she would take on a really major role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or a leading role is still hard to give Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not accustomed to it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, it&apos;s always tough to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes on a role, manifested in the various antigermanskie feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans do not just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, this is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view of Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, America&apos;s influence in European politics is subsiding, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans would just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like, unpleasant or strengthens the enmity to you - such is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, the deputy director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, Institute, in which academics and eksperty-politologi from Europe and North America together explore the problems of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Szabo is a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is officially registered in China, the name that has nothing to do with firms from the names of which it was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not sued. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But even then, it is not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas pattloh, a lawyer specializing in the company of Taylor Wessing violations of trademark rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitatoram is to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Make it lu-gucci instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register a prada-kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloh opens the folder with records of trademark registration offices in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered there trade mark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also the name of fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> What the Chinese - world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities have many-storied department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, no such case pattloha. On behalf of its clients he opposed the order to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the office of registration of trademarks, which has the right to use the name beregu somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;marka-passazhir,&quot; Ban minpaj. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> It is a word associated with &quot;ban dakuanj.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So call women who are hunting for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;it damages the business, with the need to fight,&quot; says pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;while the trademark, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs millions in the affected areas, especially in the case of expensive kopiruemyh products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the research firm CLSA China market, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury items. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But achieving the removal of questionable entries in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name became &quot;the reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If a complainant is lucky, he will even be plagiatoru must pay damages, as his trademark in China, says pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is ruled by the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous case of graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, shortly before the company, which acquired firmu-proizvoditelya betononasosov Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> However, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Kupivshaya Volvo company Geely originally used sine-belyj logo, like the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of fashion goods advertised as lost in China imitatoram from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Chinese authorities did not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Patent and trademark registration ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the past year happened &quot;return from an emergency situation in the process to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the amount of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To deal with this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations in the world, according to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it paid 1.8 billion yuan Wurden. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If simplify, it means that every check-in/worth an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Appeal against it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans managed to ensure that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator secured a Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own negligence, as the names in Germany are not subject to protection, &quot;writes venttsler, chairman of the board of the Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim myunhentsev. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both these instances Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to struggle so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You need to be on guard </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttsler hopes to bring the case to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Domestic spending is unlikely to be the accounting firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully proposed the loathly side of the &quot;great shestiznachnuyu amount in euros&quot; for the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;this makes it clear how expensive it is,&quot; says venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The danger of the far east threaten to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> And it is in the case of imitation registered there for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;we need to be vigilant,&quot; says venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and attorney-at-law pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be &quot;all that in any way is worth defending, non-personally also in China,&quot; says venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can do much more than check-in/. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about trademarks, you will have to pay the loathly side of the licensing fees for its own name, explains venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we drive away from the market in the dark segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Aids Day: pritoptyvatj, to sing, to help </seg>

<seg id="1723"> Nearly ten years for this strange razuchivaet choir soft language and from time to time even takes them back to where they first appeared: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After all, the distance 8733 kilometers from hajdeljberga, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir. </seg>

<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus Ich. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In a nutshell is reflected in the esitzheni disease of the Swaziland: high levels of HIV infection, the lowest in the world of life expectancy, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection, almost half of the population is not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of the population in Swaziland are the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth selusin is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but above the imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without the school education of people in poor countries have no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was a private commitment of the participants for a few euros in the year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later, the choir founded the &quot;voices for Africa,&quot; which has since almost professionally cares for orphans of Aids in esitzheni. </seg>

<seg id="1755"> When infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints at mocheispuskanii, selection, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as the bubbles or sealing. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and went unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> As part of the bacteria, sexually transmitted diseases can spread also by contact infection and in close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> However, experts recommend regular inspection, especially with frequent change of sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> In the early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> The king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; said Annete lennartts, &quot;because he is associated with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch black Africa, the King msvati III, is known for his love of izlishestvam. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1778"> Free condoms have literally on every corner, says Annete lennartts, &quot;but they almost do not use. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Another culture - the flesh to flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> Slightly to support cultural exchange, the chorus of ibmogni every two or three years is traveling in South Africa and sings the song, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus, full of White, who sang the song on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even have provoked tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip is also in esitzheni, where singers visit the sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on a map in the Valley of the river etsulveni it more than known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> In esitzheni, there is light, &quot;say the people here. </seg>

<seg id="1786"> NASA&apos;s Messenger: merkurii ice opens </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Ice cover can have up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although she is closest to the sun, there also is the frozen water, as evidenced by the three studies, published Thursday in the journal Science special. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that is constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It measures must be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid that may be confronted with merkuriem. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, &quot;said Supervisor probe Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Temperatures in the merkurii can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life into other places in the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Insensibly for the inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depth of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time they send to Earth images: a small window in endless expances. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which turns around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not &quot;planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This fragment Spitzer telescope infrared image is &quot;family portrait&quot; of the countless generations of stars: the old stars in the form of blue points, is more difficult to identify in a circle of pink &quot;newborn&quot; stars. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region zvezdoobrazovaniya neromantichno - scientists call it W5 Spitzer telescope - opened in the constellation kassiopeya, at a distance of 6,500 light years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The dying star photographed the iridescent heat of NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Similar to a donut ring consists of the material, which star threw in the process of dying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In a gigantic nebul Trifid, a remote on the 5400 light years from Earth, of gas and dust are the new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope made the photo of the galactic maternity Hall. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Star of the Galaxy, also called the &quot;seven sisters,&quot; can be seen at night with the naked eye. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Of course, with the telescope colors are better. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> As the red eye winks observer nebul snail on this infrared image. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is located at a distance of 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> The similarity with the continent has brought this nebul the nickname &quot;North America.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of normal and infrared photography provides eloquent reproduction. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: as they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> This may be pieces of the moon of Saturn, which has disappeared 4.5 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the greatest and most clear images from the Hubble Space Telescope: the Galaxy maelstrom </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the remote for a few thousand light years in the constellation Straltsou nebul Trifid. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trehdoljnyj, trehrazdeljnyj), as dark streaks of dust share in three parts of the cradle of hot stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation zmeenostsa astronomers are the harbinger of a space collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth of the kernel of the two merging galaxies blow towards each other and will inevitably face. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This is the birth of stars removed in the Hubble telescope spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Those who don&apos;t like technical cuts may call it nicknamed &quot;the yuzhny tsevochnoe koleso.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1824"> A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the nebula in the constellation of Iris tsefeya. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Nebul, located at 1400 light-years away, is composed of particles of dust, the dimensions of which from 10 to 100 times less than the usual Tivi dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes, remote to 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA&apos;s Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A spiral galaxy scientists call was UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this stellar Nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Star cradle constantly creates new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> This stellar cloud, united with the tumannostjyu socket, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this bright fluorescent galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only the gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608, Hans lippersgeem - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes have become increasingly available - and their view of the space deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope &quot;Hale&quot; in the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The Mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the US, installed a binokulyarnyj telescope. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;Gran teleskopio kanarias&quot; has a huge internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The Mirror &quot;big South African telescope&quot; in South Africa segmentirovano - for the sake of cost reduction. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tightly to seal under the vertical angle - it limits his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Telescope &quot;hobbi-eberli&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His feature: the high svetosobirayushchaya capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> She reaches - despite a relatively small diameter mirror - the world&apos;s largest telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope in the aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to vnezemnym signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Participating in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by giving its processing power. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> The view of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) service in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> It is &quot;a very large telescope&quot; is completely appropriate to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> His four mirrors to cover in the visual pipe even average infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install a European &quot;very large telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should spread by as much as 42 meters, and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> But the photos should not expect before 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, both the Keck telescope in Hawaii Volcanoes, &quot;&quot; Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They are two of the mirror with a diameter of ten meters. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;the Keck telescopes&quot; are part of the mauna-kea Observatory, which along with them is looking to the Sky also with the help of telescopes &quot;Subaru&quot; and irttf. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> In addition, the mauna-kea should have new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of 30 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Here they can admire the illustrations. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important views from space, the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> On April 24, 1990, he delivers a picture of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, &quot;Kepler space telescope&quot; is looking for planets outside the solar system - the first such, on which it is possible to life. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 planet-kandidatov was found with the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The photos show the Kepler space telescope &quot;cooking.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 on board of the Ariane 5. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: he needs in the light of the first stars and galaxies to look for a big explosion. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists suggest that there is ice on the south pole of mercurius. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, reliable data on this is not present, as &quot;The Messenger&quot; moves closer to the north pole of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements for decades pointed out that the merkurii have ice. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the zapushchennomu zondu in 2004, &quot;Messenger&quot; - the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now confident in this. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink your oil every day - and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Many residents in the southern Azerbaijan pau-biblejski reach old age. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> Even here there is the Museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> The search for solution in a country where 97-letnie men seem still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Many residents in the southern Azerbaijan pau-biblejski reach old age. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> Even here there is the Museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The search for solution in a country where 97-letnie men seem still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> A trip through the talish mountains can be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> A minibus with gromyhaniem rolls along a winding road past the overgrown with thick Forest Hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> All around the green so vividly that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the southern edge of Azerbaijan, Iran&apos;s border is just a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here are the talishs - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which we know little, except that they are speaking in Farsi and azerbajzhdanskom and otlichajutsja longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> The final point is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> A small town flaunts too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe almost didn&apos;t come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too utomiteljna. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Of the 323 kmі takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian Sea, here in the province, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, pilata fatulaeva (48) is convinced that the lerike have something to interest tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;in May, Baku has become famous for the Festival of Song contest, and next year we will be the Festival of the people of the world,&quot; says fatulaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here documented biography about eight dozen talyshej of these places, which more than 100 years. Fatulaeva ukazyvaet on the black and white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he is 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years he begat another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the star of the museum is Chaban Shirali myuslyumov, who allegedly was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificates, however, is not present. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, the age of 122 years, myuslyumova age is extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;he was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; explains fatulaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he had 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Make myuslyumov Chaban added a couple of dozen years to his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;a lot of people of advanced age can be found in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza in the valley in Pakistan,&quot; said Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia is also extremely many very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, because of the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registry of civil condition.. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day drinkware baked oil </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of lerika shockingly often reach biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now there are 20 people over the age of 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the south, so many long-livers? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The azerbaljani guide Farid mugimzade explains this special talyshej genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum director fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The talishs love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them for a baked oil every day. But it is hardly a vysokokalorijnaya diet can be healthy with dietologicheskoj point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or the case in the past, which preserves the lifestyle of the Molodist people in chengemirane, a tiny village &quot;near the town of Lerik, zhivet rubaba mirzoeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzaeva, which claims that it has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with barrels of oil, which tirelessly ride back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter mirzaevoj, who have long been already have their grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby at the other two babies. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen guests prepare tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied drinkware armudu. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The mirzaevoj perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark blond spit, which her son proudly explains to us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always have my hair milk, so that they will never slip and preserve the color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;and I never had a shampoo,&quot; says mirzaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> A monthly pension of hvataet to life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my life I never bought products in the store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was only after the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it was better when &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult created around the figure of Father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, then the reins took his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Yet among Azerbaijani elders no poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> $230K manates (about the same as the same amount of euro mirzaeva) receives a month as a pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can well live. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, long grew up the son of mirzaevoj is right: &quot;old people in our culture are deep respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by the care and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is not in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution was back in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo show deep divisions of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president does not scrimp on Pafos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was turned to the people, but in the first turn to the Christian koptam, liberals, enlightened Muslims and has been practiced for non-religious Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, they still hopelessly disconnected in the rasteryannyj of the opposition, are afraid of. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> The fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and broadened its competence, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save 61-letnij engineer with a doctorate in American at the University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles managed to get in the nochnoy 15-chasovoj jump with obstacles on the islamistski configured the constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial system is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does it mean to &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use rasplyvchatuyu formulation and zutritt in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least, it is one of the newest article: in all matters relating to the sharia should be involved for the Council of University ahl-achard, an Islamist institution in the country&apos;s great authority in the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but may mean that the clergy nadziraet for the legislation that the de facto would be the consequence of limiting the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> In a draft of the constitution much is subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians before military courts. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts during the Mubarak served to suppress the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the overthrow of the dictator in a military prison were to 11.000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family,&quot; and &quot;to maintain its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally it is so vague that public institutions with the help of this article can control even the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Open Text it means nothing but censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But another prohibits insult and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is insulting and how it should be, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also questionable is the wording that prohibited &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Will it be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about lawyers? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation, like a lot of things in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and which, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;the revolution is back&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> For several weeks is formed the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual fellowship in the evening Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;the revolution is back, and we will be victorious,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, took the third place in the presidential election. </seg>

<seg id="2014"> &quot;someone more like akvavit than rakfisk,&quot; says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This drink is able to interrupt the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I tried a couple of pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it will be possible to take a piece of the nose, then it&apos;s not so bad - differs little from a portion of the land, which you long was driven to a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of an entirely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish soak in autumn germeticheski closed barrels with salt water. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> While the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is due to join in the post, a correspondent for the BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and on mixed expectations of the population of his country. </seg>

<seg id="2053"> This city is overloaded transport and in the best of times, and Monday were erected the steel barrier, the pererezavshie several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, it was not done in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests to get to the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Sunday, the new head of Mexico&apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto wear a sling and will take the reins of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Before him is no easy task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now folds its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed about 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;my government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to fight violence,&quot; said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Such statements before next to the US president&apos;s political career Mr Peña Nieto developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland in the country&apos;s populous and vast state of the country&apos;s capital, opinions about the new leaders are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Outspoken man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic town of valle-de-bravo, for example, about him recall with warmth. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents put him in the recovery of tourism, the development of the resort industry and building infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built g-ohm Pena Nieto, which are very different from those roads with vyboinami and yams, which were previously on this place. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> A placard with his name hangs on a modern building sports centre on an impressive and interactive museum devoted to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;we associate with him hope of real and serious changes,&quot; says his friend and political ally by Gabriel oljvera Hernandez, a congressman from the state headed by Pena Nieto institutsionno-revolyutsionnoj party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman oljvera admits that after his 12-year-old absence in the presidential palace los-pinos party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> In addition, he dismissed accusations of bessoderzhateljnosti, which has a new president of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is very straightforward and very devoted to the realization of its vision of the future of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The municipality of nesaualjkojotlj, also known under the name sjyudad-nesa, is the most startling contrast with the valle-de-bravo paved streets. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the estakadami highways, he in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality also are severe nature of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, for the pacification of gangs selling drugs in these areas were brought troops; and violence against women is here especially acute. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> To survive the vast landfill only in the past two years, was found dozens of bodies of dead women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico City during a particularly proud of its Mr Peña Nieto is much higher than the figure in the notorious proslavivshemsya violence the city of Ciudad Juárez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to the opponents of Mr Peña Nieto about him, in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to deal with the problem of murders of women. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, his administration has been accused of complete disregard for this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> A resident of concrete-mixing house, like most of the houses in the obvetshalom district, irineya buendiya could barely contain her tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter mariany moon-were. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, had committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believes that she killed her cohabitants have. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;when I got to her house, it seemed that her body before this washed,&quot; recalls Ms. buendiya. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the body is already okochenelo. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Mother mariany tells this story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which the written one word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> This, they said, was denied this family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;officials of the state has been with me, as with the old spletnitsej narushiteljnitsej, with the peace. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want the people just have to believe everything they say, and maintain a low profile. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, you can&apos;t make, especially when there are so many violations and deficiencies, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Wearing a sling on Saturday, the president of the presidential Nieto Pena, together with it will assume the major responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> For the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to address the problem a priority during his presidency. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that he will be just as President, what was the governor,&quot; said oljvera valle-de-bravo, a congressman from the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But this is what is most wary of the victims&apos; families in the sjyudad-nesa. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not complained of mistreatment, said the indictment. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to refute the claims Bradley menninga about the poor conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> During the hearing, special attention was paid to the presence of the menninga at the military prison in kvantiko, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the terms of menninga were brutal. </seg>

<seg id="2111"> Most reports do not contain complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that menninga directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said he expressed concern about these problems and spoken that visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but not fix it in writing. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;they did&quot; no problems &quot;(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in an interview,&quot; says Manning. </seg>

<seg id="2115"> Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that it was stripped of the &quot;prevention of injury&quot; and cushioned the conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - to a level below the regime supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the security of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to give the administration know that with me all right, so they canceled the warning traumatism... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months before it was transferred to a prison at the naval base in kvantiko, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he had thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness because of the intense heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He explained that psychologically very difficult when you don&apos;t know, how do you solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;my world shrank to base camp-arifzhan, up to the size of my prison,&quot; said Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought that I will die in this cage.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope the judge, at least, given that he had to survive while in detention, and substantially reduce the sentence in the case, if Manning is found guilty by a court, which is to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Protectng said it plans to offer menningu to accept the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention were justified. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of Mexican Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of a country about difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin caught between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, I went through the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and was on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two lines: one for the Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called meksikantsem. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves irlandtsami, and friends from New York feel Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I focused on the complex structure of &quot;Mexican Americans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for a name or complex constructions. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I took out his American passport and was in turn for extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered the story a few days ago, when Mexico&apos;s president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were familiar to meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The president of the Pena Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign an agreement on partnership with the US and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president of the Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals was not. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the barrel of a rifle forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans have for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is only a statesman of the us breathe a word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that the Americans posyagayut on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of the Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex are Mexico&apos;s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want to talk about the insults? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Them enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for the opportunities, and those for whom such opportunities not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of anyone - father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> It often were Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion, undereducated, from poor farming families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember about it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, saw it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination confused and unclear, but we know what the country as its. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that most of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We answer them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us a reminder about the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as the fake Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We don&apos;t speak well, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them due to failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn&apos;t have. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We were not be now for a silk curtain, finding in the US syty life, but losing the spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between the real by Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there are certain tensions - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin is upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans feel no affiliation to any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose the roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the US call us by Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during my trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans to the Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their druzjyam-amerikantsam about what it is a beautiful country and it&apos;s great to visit, and it could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will come out of it. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but deal with this castigationelf, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And rightly so. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they were received with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in the offence for the way recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than I felt. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle in the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas can become fragile foundation for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> It might be a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> A sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its eternal conflict in the Middle East have change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To this can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab Spring zakruzhili in the rebellious storm of many established Realia, with the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to stay away from the vortex, shook the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to hope for a way out of this impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the present situation gives no cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be dur-ing this week clashes only strengthened the security forces on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, said from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite incurred losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents locked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is pursuing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time works for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the rise of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the world&apos;s richest and developing states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Torzhestvuyushchie Hamas claim about creating around Israel Islamist crescent - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by a notorious paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more proislamistskie rebels to overthrow the government of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king&apos;s power by allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the president Muhammad over Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, the organization, by contrast, is in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s &quot;Iron Dome&quot; anti-missile system justified its costs at its creation and successfully destroyed many of the derelicted Hamas missiles. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its unchanged position; many European countries also laid the blame for the latest round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall, which comes on the west bank of the Jordan River is a significant part of the non-recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party - in preparation for ahead of the January 22 elections - reunited with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of the avigdora Lieberman, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What&apos;s the point to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If put in the hands of all power in the West Bank, not whether they will run out of missiles in the direction of Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps, the supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line victorious; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense part of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of the war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not less, should consider the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like bus vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv on this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and istoriko-demograficheskii is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For violent operations, which are held every few years in the territory of Gaza to crush the Hamas movement, must pay the growing frustration of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need in the external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It remains the only solution, which constantly encourages sensible representatives on both sides, and much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two states and concessions Israel territories in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> It remains a hope, not too impressive in the short term, is the hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which it is time to take the decision to cut off weapons in Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, taken in 1967 with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, the result of which can become the recognition of a Palestinian statehood. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> His role in that forced Israel to the negotiating table to play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he never presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to solve this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a catastrophic nedaljnovidnaya position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia, the entry into force of the law on the unified packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the hazards of smoking and the image of the body parts in contrast allocated on damp green boxes are identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice Australian odnotipnoj law on the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same unylo-olivkovogo color with a nasty snapshot of affected parts of the body and images of children, which undermines the health of their parents&apos; smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between a imposed mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving drop the habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for this decision was the results of research shows that people don&apos;t start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging,&quot; explains the health minister Shenzi Plibersek, citing research showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures are already considering and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his pioneer,&quot; said Scott makintajr, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette case and silicone cases, where unpleasant pictures on the packaging, grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra Ha, the company Zico already implemented around six thousand products to wholesale trade and expects the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among those parts of the population, which sent on these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After taking in Australia of a number of laws to make illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting the display of cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it may not limit in this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;if you trade tobacco and you have only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet you will find very attractive,&quot; explains bechi Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in such social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether this is the work of an average citizen who so loves of Marlboro cigarettes, which did not spare time and effort and made the video, or is behind this campaign? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new rules: these states are suing claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all of these countries are poor. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO is expected by the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Shenzi Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to make them similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada was the first obyazatel&apos;noe of the photos, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is a rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures of me not graze. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;just a cigarette and hide it in your pocket,&quot; explains Viktar El Hague, who buy gadgets cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth on the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Ju, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the center of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the task of goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;before I have landed on the new party left an hour, and now four hours,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;the government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, well, it&apos;s over, close shop,&quot; he says, vskidyvatj hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane revealed the mechanical problem and replaced by another plane, which we and wait. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines., no iPhone, nor even a duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But lately, more and more scholars and experts on child development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because in the modern world we all are constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom are passing us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we should strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time is not present. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to it. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Before I, like many, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of pompeyah found in Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> It remains an open question how we understand the tedium. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York, in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often change. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> By studying the materials research on this topic and ask the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the next definition: boredom is when the people want, but cannot do that would bring them the satisfaction. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and fatigue, he says, is that skuchaem people not to do something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> I don&apos;t want nothing to do with apathy. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main in experienced boredom, he says, is &quot;a violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in mood and a sense that time is as slow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> In the description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood says that despite a possible connection between these states, skuchaem people see causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people in depression, see problems in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored when, in fact, we just hard on something to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, which participants listened to a voice reading the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud sounds not assigned to the case of tv-programs included in the next room, others have heard these same completes-the on low volume, so that they can barely read, and a third group listened to only a voice without any sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who have heard TV-set with low volume, noted that they were bored, are more likely than others - it was hard to focus, but they did not know the reasons and attributed this boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of gveljfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do anything uninteresting, &quot;for example, look in the flow of products on line in search of Marrige, otvlekayushchaya music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he continues, that when people start swaying on a chair or draw scribble on a piece of paper, they do it from the boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply help not to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;research has shown that children who do not forbid fidget and go round, learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In any moments we all experience boredom: in the event of a delay flight (as in my case), listening to a dull speech, browsing in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people have different levels of the propensity to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special &quot;scale of the propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, &quot;much of what I have to do, monotonous and speaking in a monotone&quot; or &quot;me too much interesting, so anything not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that skuchaem boys more often than girls, &quot;said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However, in general, teenagers in general often miss. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven-eight times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32 percent of teens reported that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they get bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> While only 3% of parents said that they get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he has no data about what would be similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that &quot;adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom,&quot; mainly because children and adolescents do not allow fully address than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, research shows that it can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or the abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich to study this problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;so our brain tells us that we should do something different, and this is boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain doesn&apos;t always know than it is better to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you point this energy to play the guitar or culinary experience, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you get to watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will be. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> However, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom independently or in any way in any other way to manage their time and employment, &quot;said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;as such skills of independent regulation used in different situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to borrow something, he is also studying samokontrolyu at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think boredom must somehow elevate. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But consider it a bad thing is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agree with it. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;we see it is that we need more experience boredom, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, neutolimoe desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in today&apos;s world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when we teryaemsya the silence and do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> While it is unclear how it would apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthoney Orozco, the player of the football team and the student public college in the southeast Colorado accused of committing criminal offences, essentially that soon will be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamare and was driving in the car on the prairie near the border with kanzasom, when they had been stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco came on the court for drug possession and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, for each of them due to a fine of 100 dollars - and a date of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;we are treated as criminals,&quot; says Mr Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But whether it criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that continues for a few weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small trials depends not so much from the law, but from the point of consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana use, already charged in hundreds of cases, here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped to prosecute people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks of the law comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases associated with marijuana use, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time in some cities of the suburbs of Denver to vote for the western mountain areas to prevent the emergence in their places of new, licensed state stores in the sale of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;all of this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect further,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of the denwer. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington tozhe ozadacheno pochesyvayut head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will form the rules to determine the order of the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;in Colorado over an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example,&quot; explains Brian- and Smith, a representative of the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcohol in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, admits Mr Smith than to any proposals and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;we have no real precedent on which we could find,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill Washington State named I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and the whole year plunging olginskaya into a state of uncertainty, when there is no government licensing system, and the right of possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are only difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the state of &quot;adequate access&quot; to the licensed marijuana from a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and playschools. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;it is especially difficult will place licensed companies to trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly formed research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora sent to subordinates in an e-mail message that the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to account for the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police stop caught people in these violations, &quot;from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance in the city of the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and drug distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Prosecutor Okrug Weld in northern Colorado, Ken tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor&apos;s office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage use of its people to undergo a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> In this moment of 119 persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;the duty of our institutions - to pursue for actions that are considered criminal in the moment they are committed,&quot; said Mr tank in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response was controversial even in places like rural Okrug Mesa, where the vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the District, no longer attracts the responsibility of adults for possession of small amounts of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The district attorney Pete hauttsinger supported that decision, but also decided not to take charge on already open cases connected with storage of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that enforce the law until he will not change is our primary responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, take part in the vote, supported this decision, benefts marijuana use for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And in spite of the reaction of people in different places of the state&apos;s economic state of relations between the local authorities to experiment with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;the county prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains makalister Sean denverskij, a lawyer convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;they are so long persecuted people for it, that now cannot really accept that this is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of drug legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the legalizovannoj trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for guidance from the federal government, which still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Department of Justice to give in on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several received a wide arrests of traffickers and patients use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave permission to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be bursting-in in the House to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they hardly will turn a blind eye to regulatory authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so could not open earlier than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, advanced to the six-month ban on trade in marijuana use, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;we do not want to be in this position that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and the casacara voted for that. </seg>

<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work - hell, while others literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them are ANTO Widjaja, one of the 400 miners who make a living prey of the sulfur kavah-idzhen volcano, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day ANTO descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas rising from the depths of the Earth, congeals on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Otkolov huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket at the shoulders and Neset them up on the obryvistyj rocky road. </seg>

<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro 0.05) petrochemical industry, because this mineral is spread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;as is the norm in 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each messengers,&quot; explains to us ANTO, which usually performs three daily carry. </seg>

<seg id="2571"> 30,690,000 Shakhter podennaya &quot;is very high on the local standards, where for the coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary equals two million rupees (Ex/euros),&quot; explains truckers, who previously worked as a Mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day, and the plot was not as dire, but ANTO returned with his family in banjyuvangi, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as massive as the sulfur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and carried it on yavu, she converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The ANTO asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly has light and had watery eyes because of toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In my 27 years ANTO spent three years, risking a kavah-idzhene in the sulfur, which is already beginning to take a toll on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly has light and had watery eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price that he must pay for the achievement of their dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;porabotayu two more years because I want to open a shop or to study French or Spanish,&quot; he promises on more than an English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> A punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a reception in the hotel, but instead he does the work of mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing dirty wooden hut with other nosiljshchikami, he gets up every day in the two hours of the night, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and glitters in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging the shadows, the ANTO down in the crater, covering a road lamps, a small podsoedinennym to his helmet, which he bought with their own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters carried baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, the mining company is not mehanizirovala sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment nosiljshchikam, who work at their own expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not even get a part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for the picture, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and his lyudej-mulov. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;this work for cattle, and not for the people,&quot; said badrusin, a stocky porters, who spent 42 years in the kavah-idzhene three decades since he left college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept the job &quot;as long as can be,&quot; because he needs the money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Not go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burning throat and hum of the eye, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, artrozy, pain in the knees and ulcères on his shoulders, which deformirovalisj under the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing a basket on his back, unajnik now can only raise 50 kilogram in its 53 years. </seg>

<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, a senior, 30, also works carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what do human mules with kavah-idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;the population of Singapore need to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I husband Patriot, you are my wife patriotka, will honor our civic duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising myatnyh lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying like &quot;let&apos;s put Bao (roll) in the stove&quot; to laugh at birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency, which has made this video BBH, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the entertainment form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to the people, &quot;their national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world on the reproduction of a similar, so we feel that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government has much to do with the launch of the spirits, such as feromonami or organize parties fast dating (blits-svidanij). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been innovative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to resolve this problem, namely compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2,2 child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not take it so lightly, so this is the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1,300 US dollars a year on policy for the inspiration of the citizens on the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, increases of maternity leave and provides tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of this has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore - it is the rich and hi-technology gosudarstvo-gorod in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management on the population, is now on the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the national office on the population, says that the &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;it allowed people to have a wider range of options in regard to life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family formation,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms boosted the number of bachelor and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to reduce immigration to counter a sharp increase in the population, causing outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites where flourishes barely hide xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party Singapur got the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While falling fertility has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to is not so much of a small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The leadership on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments are 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a holostomu lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build a big family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of domostroiteljnoj firm El developers, says that their &quot;shoe box&quot; sold much faster than the more spacious specimens. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flow is increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new standards give more clear for developers who had placed obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Slishkom perenapryazhennye </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of the national birth rate, after talking with singapurtsami, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;people are very perenapryazheny, housing costs, as well as education, and because of that many people this delay,&quot; said a young managers. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;but it is important for me to have their own time and money,&quot; says another young man of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The men and women of his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them to have a child. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, how would the government nor tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in regard to childbirth, the last word remains for singapurtsami. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Personal offline - one in sexvideochat </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confdentiality. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about the &quot;sphere of private or personal life, which have the right to protect from any intervention.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2661"> &quot;social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or pau-bystromu with their friends,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Without a second thought, replies that never would accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;although I know that this is kibermobbing,&quot; he confirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marjelos Porras, the acting coach who both English and an expert on the education and training, believes that to direct children and teenagers, need to understand that the purpose of social networks - to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the arrival of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras points out that radzim Mark prenski, master pedagogics of Yale University and the author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms for the explanation for the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still have to learn,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He said that this issue is very complicated, &quot;because we ask to have a certain criteria of what you can or can&apos;t distribute, publish or speak, in the age when maturity is not enough for this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;also that they were selective, while the more important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, is to ask questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;they say that they do not do this, it is useless,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras then lists some of the options: there are things you are not told a stranger, so why do you do it online? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have liked it if it published a photo of you like that of the published you about your friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you podpisyvaeshj party photos, if you ask permission from other people to celebrate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more thing, all it needs to know, what are you doing in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;beyond the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, as it should be in the social networks,&quot; said she. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo guardiya, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for the heads of families in good faith to read the policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding each of these points, they have good reason for talking to children about the opening of the account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;for example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson &quot;don&apos;t tell with strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Unasur summit ends without the limskoj declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Vi-vii presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without declaring a limskoj declaration, signed by the previously announced and theoretically binding family members. </seg>

<seg id="2727"> &quot;we decided to give the group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connection of South America, especially in the rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming a new economic scheme,&quot; said the Peruvian president in reading the message. </seg>

<seg id="2756"> We are not talking about human rights, it is the word we use in this case, but there were constant debate. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;this solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Baltasar Garzón, is a series of processes in different European entities,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And argued that &quot;if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, doprosit in Ecuador&apos;s embassy Senor Assange in London or doprosit it on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa seized the opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, &quot;bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the main enemies of freedom of the press is not spoiled zlodei-politiki, and bad journalists supporting speculative, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization &quot;must be strong and not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of the rule of law,&quot; because in reality &quot;it has eroded the legitimacy of the plane of democracy.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2765"> At the moment, this decision is not followed. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the dispute about the sea borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that the &quot;right for Latin America to apply to the international court, if the two countries agree to take a decision, whatever it may be.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if loses the election in February 2013, the faded from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Personally, I was never interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be fixed only by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;my political movement believe that I guarantee this probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In the case of the victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we move out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;this decision,&quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President nikolasom Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which has already been scheduled, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;this does not mean the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The mortality rate from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I like deafened by,&quot; he recalls the difficult, despite all the time with a doctor, moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> V.spivakov concealed it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Having decided to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible and his efforts to materialize - he already celebrated its Forty-third birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the &quot;old&quot; patients wych-otdeleniya hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the diagnosis &quot;of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years in the early 1990s in it would be hard to believe - then there are too few treatment options, too little known about the disease, too biased treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even so, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had a cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now you can survive with this syndrome and do it, not worsening quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, still many people come when the virus has already damaged the, &quot;drew down&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in time, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the wych-otdeleniya hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publications. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectionists and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with a life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when reports of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of wych-polozhiteljnogo at the age of 25 years, according to the term &quot;maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To appreciate this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today in an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in the halisko 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by May of this year, however, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> &quot;why there are still letaljnye outcome? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I imagine so things in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the past 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don&apos;t know about his infitsirovannom condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led the crushing data: &quot;nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunisticheskuyu infection; that we need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all of the people who it will be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in the halisko (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in private laboratories, pobuzhdennyj only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> All changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think will die, and did not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;times are still die, the better I will nadiratjsya three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents only know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of themselves and the other people,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with the Milenio Jalisco to prompt his statement of those now in the context of World AIDS Day, is afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let the proveryatsya, if there was a risk of infection, may soon learn whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, was responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> It is his message said the theme of the struggle against AIDS in this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> The gap between the health programs and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from of the city of Guadalajara, which started a problem with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the places on this task, &quot;actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us the hundreds of packages, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;why are you?&quot; is a popular question, with ehidstvo and condemnation by social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured communicator. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only over the counter and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This does not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not about the payment of beer and a motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is it possible condom distribution in its leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;this is not uality, it is best to make condoms available to those already practicing sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data in halisko </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Of the total 13,435 registered cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317 (12,158). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state ranks fourth in the national rankings in new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of infections related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to perinataljnomu Road. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as the one known case is from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the court of appeal of the United States of the decision, which cancels debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through the competitive production in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country, which has a solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms that are Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the approval of the judgement on June 15, Judge Harlin Hale in the court of the bankruptcies of the Northern District of Texas, leaves unwarlike Mexican firms in the face of possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the decision opens the door to the manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, citing as proof of the three non-compliances. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> As an introduction, while the judge the case notes that lenders should be governed by the code of the US bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive production to Mexico. </seg>

<seg id="2835"> Second, the verdict states that mezhfirmennogo without the vote, approved in a critical mass of competitive production of debt, which is the parent company of Vitro, would not have achieved majority necessary to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first time accepted this scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, among them agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed the Federal Institute for competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or the other lenders Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds &quot;vultures&quot; like aurelios capital, aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not achieve the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> These data to the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which it has since 2008, affected a serious economic crisis that struck the United States, with strikes on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> While the firm family Gonzalez Sa&apos;da to appeal against the decision in the court of appeal to the vote came to its plenary session, the five judges, due to the fact that they voted only three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the case of failure would be charged the application for certification, which would require a revision of the process from the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (friend of the court &quot;), which describes the in vitro process, which should be in the framework of the law on competitive industries, signalling that he frees himself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the US bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, notes that the country complied principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> An basket-ball traveler Hektor &quot;hetin&quot; Reyes was more than 60 years associated with this sport, and thanks to him, traversed the entire world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball history as the &quot;Hektor&quot; hetin Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And because before bleeding in the brain prikovalo him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player, small categories, the player of the mini-basketball league, the commissioner and the chief of the BSN kovboyami with bayamona and the president of basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have done a lot of roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, when I was the president of BSN, the director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s,&quot; recalls Reyes during the visit of the Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all with photographs and memorabilia gathered for his long way show about it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In the heart of Bayamon </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys since the 1950s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance in the role of so-agent or agent contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships Cowboys since 1967, as the agent of the so-agent, or supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There was a lot of years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, continue to lead became &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Jean Bartov, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have for you is a very strong player, 6&apos;7 growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;do you want?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And it was the beginning of a Minsi, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartov then recommended that a sniper Raymond gaussa, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship bayamonu Gauss, would help to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Cowboys with chempionstvom gaussom I enjoyed, but already in the distance, because the 1988 already was the head of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I chose to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements of the Minsi in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember how we won for the first time in the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, for which we received the fourth place and it was to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, which made us beat the final game, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The 1990 World Championship team is the best team, what you have ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was that of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the US team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Championships here. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In the team not only again played Minsi, gaussa, Ramon rivasa, FICO Lopez and&apos;pikulina &apos;(ortisa), but also young (Javier) &apos;tonjito&apos; colon and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and Leon (Edgar) and Mario&apos;kihote &apos;Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995 in neukene, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role players like&apos;kanito &apos;njevesa, Pablo alisea and young Rolando hurruitnera in return for disarrangement players, temporarily otstranennyh panamerikanskom championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His performance at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico do not dominate at this level as it did Pikulin. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this is without taking into account of his career in different leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best puertorikantsem head? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a very difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good young growth, including Julio Toro, Flora melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> From the young, I really like the work of Leo arilly. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What would you consider your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Were the things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of the smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now they travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I see the fruits of a compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, yicabel, which was always with me. </seg>
