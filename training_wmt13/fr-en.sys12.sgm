<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to counter Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against the election fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center considers it as a myth, claiming that election fraud is most rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Moreover, the lawyers republicans have been only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will influence negatively the level of participation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine part of the democratic system in the us. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the united States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of governments americans promulgu√®rent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010, which saw add 675 new representatives republicans in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and proof of u.s. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of vote by anticipation, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and retire to the citizens having a criminal record their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no State in the us is required voters to present an identity card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first State to ask such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force the voters to submit an identity card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the american citizens do not have identity card universal as the map of the sickness insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the american people, or 21 million people in age to vote, do not possess identity cards with photograph issued by a government agency in their State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> By the way, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a piece of identity. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the id card is required. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affects young people, minorities, and persons with low income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of the African-American, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000; 18% of the citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years old do not have the identity card required photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, of the voters considered voting more for the democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photograph issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same States allow the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that vote more on the republican side to use it to vote the cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no State requires proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen States have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are u.s. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it seems that two hispanic voters on three encourage the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> By the way, the republican legislators have sponsored by 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to enrol. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, the country of registration of the voters have helped to save approximately 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a fall of 17%, the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, the republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the period of advance polls. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who have voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the voters of the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It was the same with the Hispanic. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, the white, which made up 76% of voters do not accounted for 46% of voters voting by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers democrats and their supporters objected vigorously to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the governing democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the laws of the most controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit some of the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 States have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics democrats denounce the partisan laws that have been voted on, and they see it as an obvious objective of influencing the results in 2012 in the key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will influence negatively the level of participation. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine part of the democratic system in the us. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening of prostate cancer: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the test of APS would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What to do to hesitate still more men are already reluctant to undergo screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have recommendations farms. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one european, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who have not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend that the test from 50 years, or 40 years old if it was a direct parent who has already had a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of african-american are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once it has been detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are for aggressive cancers and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It really takes to make it clear to the patient, the degree of risk of cancer by offering him the possible options, by not addressing necessarily cancers of the prostate, which do not affect the long-term life, and opting rather, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men at whom it detects a cancer will not be processed, because their cancer is not aggressive and are not a threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will suggest them to make the active monitoring, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it is determined with accuracy of criteria to decide who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend, therefore, when even pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if you should move or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the international Society of urology, Movember has created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (in English for the moment, a translation will be available shortly) to this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of good habits of life, is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if all the world was eating well and was moving enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one smoked, this rate is expected to rise to at least 50%&quot;, stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many are also totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the canadian cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smoking rooms. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of cases of cancer of the lung. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This night much to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; the spokesman Andrew Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervix. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against cancer of the colon&quot;, adds-on. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The power </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too much of it, she pushed the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The meats too, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or curing can lead to the formation of cancer-causing substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer&quot;, explique-t-on. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, are not conclusive for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Then one of them found a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on the cancer is not clear, either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> By the way, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of speaking of her worries and family history with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Spend a screening test, it does not give the cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson husked </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery is probable that the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this boson is participating in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the Universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard Model - our best, or &quot;less worse&quot; explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether it is the property of the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a genuine new particle, and it looks a lot like the Higgs particle predicted by the standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data to be unveiled this week at a large convention of physics, Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but there remains a lack of data to be perfectly certain. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose all the same whether it is well Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem thin, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law must inevitably wanting that two things cannot gather at the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you&apos;re going to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But even if the particle physics is a world that is strange, it turns out that she, too, is a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot;, consisting of roughly in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner we found good citizens named fermions, who obey quietly in the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other agitated bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have respect for nothing, but in any case, not to this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons, is divided into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: mesons, that we will not discuss here, and the &quot;force particles&quot;, by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would be in some way related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it must be stressed here, not all of the critters as exotic as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a ruling of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the &quot;particle of light&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in effect, a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or changes direction, it &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;inconvenience&quot; is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons &quot;bearers of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Field more stable </seg>
<seg id="124"> It&apos;s the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; for this boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Gold, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, a little bit as if it were a frozen pond which only a very large rock could rider the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator as one of the CERN&apos;s Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> This is because not all the particles, and all of the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, the font, but other non - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, these are not all of the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon, hey) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what is &quot;can bring&quot; all of this research, demand Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this is used to check the validity of the standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to discern any difference between the observations and predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are, moreover, several hope that you find, because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and fill some holes in the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, does not offer any explanation for gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which form approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But it has not found such differences at CERN up to now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of these research in the daily lives of mr. and mrs. Everything-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be one. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Stand: at the very beginning of the 60&apos;s, the pioneers of laser, in Bell Labs, not suspected of any revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw of scientific applications, but nothing of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, we have already said, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself has developed the world&apos;s first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962, at the start of the laser was rather seen as a &quot;gadget lab&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, the applications can also be obtained from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, in the course of his work in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not its original intention, now serves to&quot;look&quot; at all the digital cameras of the world, and earned him the Nobel prize in physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does of course not to say that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end-of-life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume shortly so that a draft law is prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Duty has tried to look at it more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> There are some weeks, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Monteregie region. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was eating him had left a respite of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot; They had given me five years to live, I&apos;ve done seven years, &quot; he says, mid-fig mid-grape, lying in his bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot; But it is always a shock, you can&apos;t be prepared for that, &quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is at work: a huge weakness which makes going to the toilet by himself, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> While sitting in front of a mouth-watering breakfast, he agrees to let it help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, it happens even to smile, talk to strangers who busied themselves around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the death of the ordinary. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot; My biggest wish is that I will heal diarrhea, it is humiliating&quot;,-he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot; In the course of our life, we learn that a man, it piss standing &quot;, says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the maison Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot; It depends on the ability of the person &quot; to accept the regression, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments unfold in the very heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around us, does not provide more care so-called &quot; healing &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Ms. A., 89 years ago, the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and throttled &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot; I have good children, &quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot; I no longer wish in life, &quot; she said, before accepting that it poses a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She waits all the same, in the next few days, a last visit to his son come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor-Gadbois, it is a lavish, with a group of volunteers taking care of the body and helps it to the power supply. </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are the palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, there are a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when it is known that the end we all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life goes on in the best conditions possible, &quot; explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Regardless of the level of physical comfort, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> In dying, you will care of mouth brandy or Pepsi, according to the request. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will not be obliged to monitor their blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, we have served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who will end the beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot; We help the loved ones as much as the patients, &quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Home Victor-Gadbois, the days are the same. </seg>
<seg id="187"> On the side of an old man with a 93-year-old who enjoys his last meeting of the family in the yard, well propped up on his pillows while a toast in his honor, a young man of 36 years, died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot; For the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer under the age of 45 years &quot;, worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois come to their home, 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, treatments designed to soothe the pain when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Society of home-based palliative care in the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in the health care quebecers who is afraid of several specialized doctors in palliative care, the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed by the leading experts in palliative care, of which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, runs to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the quebec health care system is not performant enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before it agrees to perform euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I saw a patient to spend 14 days in the emergency department, in great pain, and that they take all necessary steps to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists hell-bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when she dropped a grueling chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she told me she was sorry that I had to stop beating me, she told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Nevertheless, she had told me that I was finished ! </seg>
<seg id="202"> &apos;t care all-powerful </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel is believed that 90% of the patients who ask to die like to thank the caregiver does not have acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that the palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to the Company of home-based palliative care in the Greater Montreal, patients will be refractory to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, the doctors have so often resort to palliative sedation, who returns to fall asleep at the patient until the time of his death, or sporadically, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the possibility to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: &quot; I want to die. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot; I want you to me euthanasiiez &quot;, it means &quot; I want to be relieved &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The achievement of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism of the canadian Institutes of health research in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Scandals real large scale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road, contractors in the CONSTRUCTION industry, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a great &quot;system&quot;, combining building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and members. </seg>
<seg id="214"> The &quot; industry &quot; which has very costly to taxpayers quebec, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how the system is crumbling since we took the great ways&quot;, quips Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former police chief of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is by him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, by means of a background investigation on the corruption related to contracts for road works in Quebec, in which the liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had agreed that backwards. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; was a direct link between industry, financing secret of political parties and corruption of public officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only department of transportation would have saved a billion dollars over the contracts,&quot; some that restrain their instincts to touch a share ! </seg>

<seg id="226"> Are formally accused by the way of the engineers on the road to Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused a sensation in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He himself has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded to Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid them into the money to Union Montreal, the party of the mayor Gerald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. Zambito has sowed to the winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to the provincial party, especially to the liberals in power then. </seg>

<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road confessed to be done to grease the leg swelling of 30% to 40% of the bills by false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closed the eyes on a budget parallel feeding its coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr. jones has resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis. </seg>

<seg id="240"> The survey, which will eventually be put in place, she said that she &quot;draws on a lan in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin wrongdoers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she said, is &quot;painful but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> It is in the process of cleaning the wound but it should be an investigation unit own in Montreal and a day before, so as not to see the return questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As it is the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> It regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau note from his side that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but are concerned, above all, the role of the&quot;elected representatives aware of the stratagem&quot;, when they do trempaient not in the scam ! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Considering, 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of the reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of quebec offers a limit of $ 100 donations to political parties but this will not change the deal, according to him: &quot;as long As we will not limit strictly the election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It advocates a comprehensive review of the system for the allocation of public contracts and the financing of political parties: &quot;We can&apos;t go lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will to rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story is tarnishing the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not the FC Barcelona !&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken on a new scale and with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress ? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It can be explained by a decision of individual conscience but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I rose to their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff, I was also brought much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> In daily life, these elements lead me to raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the game, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything goes very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not inflame. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My debut in the centre of training of the INF Clairefontaine to my trip to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You pull therefore benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits of this summer are used to playing at the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each workout is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> What makes a player like me want to face it and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> By the way, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right man for the job ? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and is part of the best coaches in europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It was a great experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs upscale. </seg>
<seg id="273"> It has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will win other securities in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a discussion comforting with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I went out then a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he grant me also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What&apos;s your opinion on the first part of the season of the PSG ? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon we took the place of the leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the champions League: we have qualified for the 8th finals with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the goal of the club in this competition ? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we will have our say in the face of very good european teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First we want to finish top of our group, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can it become a big european club in the short term ? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a great european club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG has the means to make this happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In Ligue 1, will not win the title, like last season, would be a big failure ? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we really at the heart of bagging the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it is not passed away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In may, there has been a disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We made a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It ended with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be a champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has achieved a season even more fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think that it is good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG ? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is natural that we expect a lot of us in the light of what has been invested and the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there is still things to blame us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what the people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not the FC Barcelona!!! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to put in place a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It has been proven in the champions League that we could meet present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses ! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In the light of the amounts invested, you imagined with a 15-point lead at the break ! </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglect our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been &quot;boosted&quot; by the new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in the month of may we be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much better than one might say that there is a &quot;Defeat&quot;addiction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came for that, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> It has demonstrated wherever he went he was a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, we have respect for the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It also complies with the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is really exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This pushes the other to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you experienced the Euro 2012 with the team of France ? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had the heart to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scrounge game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I&apos;ve seen things down there and I got out of it stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I can achieve good games selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I was hoping for since my baptism with the Blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What&apos;s your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps, head of the Blue ? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It has the results to him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well-placed in the group qualifier for the World. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to do the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had reached its goal we qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good draw (1-1) ripped off, on 16 October, in Spain, is there a match founder ? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all the world. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived match like it in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Just the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and cost of treatment between the stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made of monopolies bank, led to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a protocol for secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer-to-peer. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A small thousands of Web sites accept free as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course of the bitcoin, after having reached a peak of us $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, has fallen to 2 dollars, five months later, before coming back today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the european central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies released in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes bitcoin as &quot;virtual currency with the most success&quot;, &quot;in a competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to coins conventional&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as the &quot;credits&quot;, used for progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But, each time, a central authority control and the trafficking trade. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, the auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network ? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is in reality between two e-mail addresses in the way of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of encryption dual-key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can as well verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of accounts public, distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes by the resolution of a challenge mathematical launched to computers, and the winner, a kind of a central banker interim, will have the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase hash of the file, that is to say, a transformation of a large file into a digital footprint shorter and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number in front of &quot;chop&quot; the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The purpose being to find the number that gives an impression particular (lots of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found, the other nodes check easily that it is good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay two times with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the one hundred millionth, which leaves the margin... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also found in each increase of the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The flaw used does not relate to the protocol itself,&quot; said Peter Noizat, which has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB reports also possibilities for money laundering through this service anonymously. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash is also the default. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Actors such as weight Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;balances giants&quot; have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged&quot;, is looking forward to Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also the author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transaction, that come back and cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier manages more of its identity and therefore can be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement at the traders, who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is sufficient for them to communicate an address that a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of the calling into question of hierarchical systems for systems that are more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report, is also planning to re-evaluate the risks various, today regarded as high, in case of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after ? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> Nato and the U.s. should follow the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the afghan army to regain possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to choose their future, without any wait to us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> This is especially the afghan farmers that we have punished by considering them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, the maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The taliban consist of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse to accept the presence of foreign army, as of the time of the Soviet union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, the old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, pakistanis, arabs, uzbeks, tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will be more when the west will be more discrete. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, that I have observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to credits French, is in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored personnel carriers have joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no flood of the taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their advanced irresistible from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was so empty, the country in blood and fire the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their taking control of the country had then been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, the afghan government and the current taliban converge in the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main notable of the anti-soviet war came back to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have morphed into hucksters, grabbing of land-governmental sell land to the refugees from Iran and Pakistan, with&quot;huge contracts americans outsourcing. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; most of them have not fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government which is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> A lot of young people want to leave, as will those who were able to take advantage of the generosity in the us: the flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They had been associated with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul account now 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the government schools are full of girls like boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will never want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties, nor the corruption of some of the leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the tv, and its Turkish soap operas, which have a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities who will the order be considered as legitimate ? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-soviet struggle is concerned already rebuild provincial militias, which would remain outside the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization, in the image of the western nations, but the United States has opted to turn it into a centralized State, presidential power box, abolishing the post of Prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want to controls foreigners, and in particular on the occasion of the elections due in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country is, since the 50s and even before, is dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has not been filed in the road, no dam is in the state, no system important irrigation is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental control over the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise has been rumored that the Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that the Western n&quot;were there to capture it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to process the ore of iron or copper on site, nor means of transport for export through the mountains, there are no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the world Bank) and search the huge buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day we will also Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend largely on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of the troops fighting the French was completed on November 20. </seg>

<seg id="446"> These works, power-intensive-hand-d&quot;labour in the local area, have been able to help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land. </seg>

<seg id="454"> Taking all the world of tennis, it was announced on Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> There is just one week, the head of the State was granted an additional two months in this house to finish his work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> It is now nearly two years that Egypt is based on a draft text, several times amended, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For its opponents, the President perseveres in its &quot;delirium autocratic&quot;, continuing to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trample the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a way to get it over with quickly with the crisis in institutional and policy, accelerating the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which requires the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic so that the dispute has been raging in the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he claimed in an interview to the american weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> As this appeal to a vote precipitated holds the ultimatum to the egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers&quot;, and they must supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the constituent Assembly, the great majority islamist, have voted in favour of the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the democrats were still missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, and considered not to have been able to put forward their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights of religious minorities and civil society, had done the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, alternate members, have been added hastily, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the muslim brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Unsurprisingly, it is the most often unanimously that articles have been voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators have also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day will be expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee, considering that the pendulum of the constituent assembly was set wrong. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still in the process of&quot;to be voted yesterday evening, has 234 air. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of attention, article 2 finally remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that &quot;the principles of islamic law are the primary source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The islamist parties, for which the&quot;establishment of islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace the &quot;principles&quot; by &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have allowed a stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a token of their good will and respect of the other components of the egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot;, meet the liberals, who do not see it as a stroke of communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because according to them, the islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They aim, in particular, article 220, which confers to the university of Al-Azhar in an advisory role, in particular for what is to verify the compliance of the laws with the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Apple tree, it is worrying because &quot;the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the beginnings of a theocracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the liberals are further fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For the time being, there is no implication concrete religious. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civil State. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not of the ulama but academics, for some trained in the French system&quot; tempering Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the constitutional transition egyptian. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he acknowledges &quot;that there may be an ambiguity around the article 220, because the terms used borrow in religious terms. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It refers to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [islamic jurisprudence, editor&apos;s note]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question may in the future arise as to the extent of the civil judges are competent to rule on it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers which it grants to the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another point at issue: the powers given to the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Not more than not to be forbidden the trial of civilians in military courts, as called for by the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> These are also concerns about the text, which they consider to stop it. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and the insult is now prohibited, and this could have a serious impact on freedom of expression, of the press in particular. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition, there is no article does not echo to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, the only positive point is that the prohibition of torture by article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word was not included in the previous Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> While the egyptian president was speaking last night on tv, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> The supporters of the head of State will parade them on Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;That language has, in Moscow will&quot;: migrants are saving money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While the deputies and human rights activists are arguing about what is going to give the law on the language test required, fraudsters selling &quot;false&quot; certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are nationals of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal: to earn money to help their families at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since the 1st of December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass an exam in Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule is only for those who have the intention of working in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, promises the federal migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the History of Russia and the bases of law. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It will be necessary to validate her language skills in Russian to obtain and to renew his work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Are free only to the nationals of the countries where Russian has the status of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Profit, negative attitude and protection of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of exam centres will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, the University of peoples &apos; friendship, Moscow State University, the State University of Saint-Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce examinations has been supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the act enters into force, the defenders of human rights have already many times asked the question in the press: what is going to give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and the immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, meet the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering &quot;slave labour&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak in defence of the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the federal Service of the Russian migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of human rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organised selection will solve 90% of the problems of the foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language, and who do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross the dishonest people who, under the pretext of the help, it will provide a &quot;trip&quot; in a little house overcrowded where he and dozens of his fellow men will haunt for months without food and paper and must struggle between 12 and 14 hours per day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints on the part of our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Among them, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they&apos;re wrong, we take their passport, and they do not receive the salary expected&quot;, confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan Tolib Charipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Not me not quarrel, mr. policeman! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many nationals of the republics of Central Asia who wish to come to earn money in Russia confide that they do not know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> This of course, is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow, would this not be a primary education fair. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even have enough food to feed their children, not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when one does not know the language, they trust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel decreased and reduced&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> The defenders of Human Rights notice, however, an important aspect of the act relating to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The exams will be intended only to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Nevertheless, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or defense to enter&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason for this? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you may get a false registration quickly for only 1 500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The police russians know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, where the cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us, 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; he told reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot; Hurry up, don&apos;t skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of the migrants were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Many false certificates of language exams have already been confiscated by the employees of the federal migration service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The papers forged out of a color printer ordinary. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners do not have them for nothing: each migrant, who hoped thereby to facilitate the task of the examinations had to spend seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker to three thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of the power and the defenders of Human Rights, agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the exam at the first shot the time to take a language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicate with the people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Interior Ministry is not in charge of the arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carrying weapons to civilians. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it&apos;s the shots made at weddings or of the slaughter organized by the lawyer of moscow Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to prohibit the carrying of weapons rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit from 18 to 21 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> All the world is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;tightening the screws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centers of fire, require them to give up &quot;this hardening insane.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a weapon saved is minimal, said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and specialist in crime for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, on a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes have been committed with a firearm registered in the police service while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered over the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws concerning the weapons for civil will not prevent criminals from obtaining supplies on the black market . </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of the Interior stated that it control the spread of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: the plant officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market in weapons supplies via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are at number five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot taken from a site taking orders weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is &quot;the trace of the military&quot;, that is to say the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians&quot;, explains Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the forces of order. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is also well weapons stolen in the stocks of the police than those borne directly to the representatives of the forces of law and order. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The guns illegal go on sale from military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of these have often suffered from the explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Versions attested to indicate that some of the fires have been triggered on purpose to cover the deficit,&quot; says the former military. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, arms manufacturers are for something. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;We see weapons factories private that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow,&quot; says an expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> An important part of pistols and submachine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mafia formed, and organizes the supply,&quot; adds the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Center for problem analysis and study for the public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Specialists have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminal records and public information portals related to weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, just the army and security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of these weapons on the black market has recovered &quot; by fault of the employees whose work is related to arms&quot;, explique-t-on in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons originate from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from the &quot;clandestine excavations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A salesman and consultant armoury who requested anonymity provides that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by the specialists of the excavation illegal; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys through a taught a unit, for example, a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> It delivers passing the goods through a fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot; He carries in town, and sold it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers &quot;, raconte-t-il. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is true that the police are aware of all of the business, as well, when crimes are on the point to be understood, it makes a purchase of control from the merchants of illegal weapons,&quot; adds the seller. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot; As in a luxury boutique &quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I have been to sites, blogs, until a type manifests itself and offers me to come to the station Begovaya where someone was to take me in a &quot;corner&quot; to haggle. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, we gave it to me on the spot </seg>
<seg id="685"> Victor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, it is necessary that I know of someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don&apos;t trust her. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example &quot;on the part Of such a person, who has asked me to convey his daughter has lost a tooth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I even buy a pair of fists americans to help a person to whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> I the book to me only because he knows that I don&apos;t give. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The small new look of the weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when it was preparing to publish an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The patterns, according to him, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> We gave him a photo album in which there was &quot;anything you want&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I thought I was in a luxury boutique&quot;, remembers the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can all try it. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As a potential client, I don&apos;t just buy it, it goes with the seller in the forest and we install a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we start to negotiate, &quot; describes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A shop from the sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> The search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons, &quot;for different uses&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For this, we don&apos;t need no paper and no one to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot; It is enough to have a sum certain in money&quot;, wrote in advertising on the site &quot;Buy a gun or a machine gun fight&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Users leave their request and ask their questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And we sell to minors? </seg>

<seg id="711"> The buyer shall make the payment on the machines. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where it is hidden weapon,&quot; says the secretary of the association &quot; Right to a weapon&quot;, Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we may end up without a weapon, and behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The federal security Service has released a huge network of fake sites and pick up the shovel and the people who wish to buy weapons to fight. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;People are flocking on the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="716"> A Makarov for $ 100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of a firearm illegal, say experts, can cost between 100 and $ 900. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the association &quot;Right to a weapon&quot;, one can buy a gun Makarov for 100-300 dollars. </seg>

<seg id="722"> United states: the employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are in strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of american teenagers go through a job of a cashier at Mcdonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against the low wages offered by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as Mcdonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will expand or decrease rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of associations of the left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Parallel to the increase of the modest salaries earned by the employees base at Walmart and in the fast-food chains, the organisers of the demonstrations want to get to the creation of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This area is for the moment not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the &quot;black Friday&quot;at a time when a rain flood of balances earning million inhabitants has befallen America and triggering sometimes esclandres. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, certain employees of the company Walmart, which employs the world&apos;s 2.2 million people, have left their positions to hold pickets with the trade unions and activists of the left in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of the lower classes and medium-sized. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns, passing by the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are, on average, 8% to 27% less expensive than in the large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> This is why a lot of employees are poorly paid at Walmart do their shopping only at their place of work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of products made of Walmart, one of the groups most powerful in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap in particular because of the low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> These also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or scanners-handheld. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the manifestations of the &quot;black Friday&quot; were asking for a salary increase, they complained of the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company was increased from 30 to $ 100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the employee base at Walmart that affects a 9.5 per hour, it is a sum that he can not afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the university of california Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $ 12 an hour, it would cost the group $ 3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred all of the increase of wages on the shoulders of consumers, each running in the shop would 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than it is now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The supporters of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine States and carried no prejudice to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;black Friday&quot; has continued in the shops from 8 in the evening at midnight the following day, and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 items in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its unions have carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the &quot;black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman of the company Dan Fogleman assured in an interview to the site of the left Huffington Post that in any &quot;less than five employees of a wal-mart had left their posts and that the protest was a &quot;com operation&apos; among others&quot; on the part of the trade union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Next customer!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests are continuing this week in New York, and were not the most Walmart stores (in this town progressive, they are not very much appreciated, this is why they are not yet established) but the Mcdonald&apos;s and other inexpensive restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Mcdonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of portions and after they even give you no sick leave and don&apos;t pay you for the work you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the city Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and that of New York is $ 7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast-food increases with time, but low, on average, its employees basic affecting New York $ 8.90 per hour of the time. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody touches less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of american teenagers working at Mcdonald&apos;s after the high school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself interviewing employees of Mcdonald&apos;s who complain of having to live with this salary, and sometimes have to feed their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators, who have launched the movement Thursday at 6 : 30 a.m. near the Mcdonald&apos;s 40th street and Madison Avenue required that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast-food are paid a minimum of 15 $ per hour, a multiplication of more than two times the current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also requested to be established, with the trade unions in the sector of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.s. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a trade union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> The authority, however, their simplifies rarely life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a trade union, to take possession of the fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They do not agree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other events tumultuous stood near several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The key moment of the protest was the rally in the middle of the day near the Mcdonald&apos;s Times Square with the involvement of a number of policies local democrats, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the municipal Council, which said: &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of portions and after they even give you no sick leave and don&apos;t pay you for the work you have done honestly!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters have been supported by other democrats of new york in a view, in particular by the candidate to the post of mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;all of us must support the employees of the fast food that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important to have occurred in the sector of fast food in all its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundreds of people were involved, not to mention that not all were employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is currently difficult to say if this will spark mass movement will be small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the time being, we can only moderately to fool the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Lately, the fans of new technologies are used to perceive the augmented reality through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the outset, it is Google that has unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it is apparent from the interview with the director of the group of technologies of 3D interactive laboratory Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by creating virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could you tell us in a few words what is your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being to the pixels on screen and sometimes to the touch. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look 5 to 10 years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console, and the sensors Kinect constitute a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - We also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although the Kinect has been made in the physical interaction, a lot of things are happening on screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D running on different technologies, including the technologies of projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to make out the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more touch. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a form more convenient. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And to begin with, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the voice command ? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but is not overstated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> We can not say that it is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we don&apos;t always want to inform others of his actions or of its intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not gestures wide, but rather to gestures discrete, limited. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn on the hand, which recorded the movements of the muscles and bones. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Currently, he is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - That is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how I would ask you to pass this can? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would with the word and with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually, I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it&apos;s going to be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So, you want to force the users to adapt it according to what the machine may or may not do at a given time? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is of mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a good enough resolution in depth and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If one is interested in your work on sensors Xbox Kinect, what is it that you do not like in the modern cameras ? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack the resolution, depth, or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Obviously it would be good to get about 8 megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c/s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the megapixel themselves, but the quality of the matrix, and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In relation to this last point, all current technologies are good enough, this adds work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is also important to many, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s not enough really not, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond has given to the touch sensors delay regular treatment between 1 and 100 us, the sensors, the current being closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> The whole world does not understand to what extent it will influence the interaction of man and of the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would need a device of this type in my work, but do not require to touch, to have more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But don&apos;t we have to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is in fact a sensor usual visible field. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A lot of cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worsen, increasing the required volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how this could help to define the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of the technology of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the more prospects ? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, to walk around all the time with a smartphone with uplifted hands is not practical but here&apos;s what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality &quot;transitional&quot; that you would from a cloud platform to spend glasses to the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a device very personal and that is what makes their strength (personal items are the ones that you are the only one to see) and in the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let&apos;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holographic virtual in the air is no longer accessible Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands don&apos;t feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What are the answers to your group prepares there compared to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of second-hand to serve as a support in the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It saves perfectly pressure! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign the palpabilit√© to these &quot;pictures in the air&quot; : for example, the interference of several rays, ultrasound directed to a specific point where the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the time being still low, a breath of air on the tips of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the bracelets worn on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task under there, on which it will still take a long time to give of evil: how to believe in someone who is physically located in a very small space that he is walking in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also of the balls giant. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the time being, we can only moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;The avant-garde p√©tersbourgeoise&quot; dedicated to the city-dwellers who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list ultra-selective has already hosted prominent actors of the artistic stage of Saint-Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and that has found recognition in Europe, having been known in Russia as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the painter outgoing Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man, rather, bearded man, dressed all in red that we can cross near the Russian Museum, the summer Garden or in the holidays and openings connected. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables Kirill Miller together always a crowd, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the storytellers p√©tersbourgeois inherently social, and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of avant-garde p√©tersbourgeoise of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance is smiling at the people and puts them in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he has taken in his hands a barrel organ, and it became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg since he had matured enough for this role it difficult to by its existence, its philosophy, and its image as a gypsy. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why is it that you route the city, all in red and not yellow or blue turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red one as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the artist, the creator of the image and the society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in the company, everything that is not gray raises the aggression and agitation, in the negative. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to initiate the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole story of my actions challenging is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you understand that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - The exhibition at the Palace of culture Nevskiy where were my works. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of the old painters non-official was passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started to make friends with the artists of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then there is no more vague. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in theatre, the fashion, the music, all genres except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all that is found in your Clinic artistic... - It was important for me to find myself in the culture centre of Saint-Petersburg where must bring together the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was before the work is a musical club and artistic, bohemian club, the home of the bohemian p√©tersbourgeoise. </seg>

<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D137&quot;, Club &quot;Griboedov&quot;: what are the implications of the Clinic artistic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are left as they used to. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the past century, the time when the culture wanted to say something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize &quot;people of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was named &quot;artist of the year&quot;, and it was then that my reign came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="881"> This is not convenient to work in a new era, with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty, and the culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a story and a sharpness very strong. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I&apos;m going to have an exhibition scheduled &quot;The Russian museum through the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a category that is timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it&apos;s scary to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world through the disguise total and compulsory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the habit that matter, we are interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Maybe we can&apos;t give him a hand, but it is rather to spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be erased by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this type of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else but me can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But it may be that the commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today the art of trade must be careful, delicate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disintegration of the culture is in the process of happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were shared in herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the simpleton another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I&apos;m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, it is necessary to think that you&apos;re going to please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But many thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - These are people we have thrown who come to see, it is the sexual side, and social works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will be coming, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it is less of management, money, everything dies. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted the tables as a collector has hung next to Falk or Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the tables that are usually those that are painted in end-of-life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, we often confuse the ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The consumer has no culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused to accept the money just for the painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, that is what is missing in Saint-Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone can work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of good czars, it was not like that, the tsars were not well understood by the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in Saint-Petersburg who might be experts, but they are excluded, because it is necessary to experts, the most high, which will evaluate correctly these experts and their fraieront a way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot;, which blooms. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, that is what it is Saint-Petersburg ? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there are in Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art of struggling to push. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers than readers, and that is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, this layer is very thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make the art in fashion as it was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project realized with the support of the stock exchange Saint-Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> To give birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with an asteroid murderer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings on board set out in search of a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity, a big question arises: how to keep our species in weightlessness, or on a spare planet ? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two real planets that we can conquer, this would be only by assumption. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot; It is of Venus and Mars &quot;, believes Vladimir Muted, a researcher from the astronomical Institute of the State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If on March the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 . </seg>
<seg id="941"> No one can live only at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> We started to take an interest in questions of reproduction in space, focusing on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a half-century, we have performed experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas are grown on orbit does differing in any way varieties earth. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, we put on orbit insects, small flies, fruit flies breeding. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs have been sent into space to see how is developing an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> One gets the output of a chick is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot; The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find a support, it must get on its feet and start moving, &quot; explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of problems of medico-biological characteristics of the Russian Academy of sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In finding no support, day-old chicks is waved disorderly manner. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And at the end of 10 hours, the new-born saw their instincts fully atrophy. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks did not react neither the light nor sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they would die just at the end of four days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot; We have √©carquill√© the eyes two times, and then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there, &quot; says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in the space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;ark miniature&quot; organic with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite &quot; Bion &quot; there will be that of the species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses in the space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing found nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot; It was still biosatellites and then it is only experience. It is necessary to carry out this kind of research, &quot; remarked Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the rats space have given birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, it is still not managing to make reproductions directly into space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is not a trivial matter. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Losing their usual environment, the animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, man is able, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create an emotional background suitable. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women are in the area for the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity&apos;s most precious possession. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could not say if it would hold up after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she would have been able to give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot; Nobody answered this question, &quot; says Vakhtang Vatchnadz√©, retired from the area of rocket and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in the mid-extra-vehicular activity, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, very little of cosmonauts, who have nothing had and who give birth to offspring in full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot; And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during the flights in orbit &quot;, concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in the biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre of preparation of cosmonauts: mandatory step in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in the neutral buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extravehicular activities. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water mimics the conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, the water is comfortable, however, a foreign setting, for infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The little men amphibious seem to confirm this: life on the Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> To the extent that the baby is changing about 9 months in the lymph fluid from his mother&apos;s womb, it is easier to get used then to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle it is logical, because since its birth to her first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot; This is very little to forget, &quot; says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if the child who has been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs of gravity, a force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, atrophy very quickly, the ability to thrust the baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, ignore it by relying on the simulators of childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course, we can prepare a birthing in a special room, the woman will bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot; And then?&quot; asks Valeriy Polyakov, inviting them to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> From another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the earth&apos;s attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for the trainings. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of its vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot; And this experience that we might consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a child with a disability, completely inept &quot;, provides for the Director of the committee for bioethics of the Institute of problems of medico-biological characteristics of the Russian Academy of sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of the children in the area is still something of a theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earth will be in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the SAI (supreme audit Institution (public finance) said: &quot; the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech &quot; system ≈†varc &quot;) failed because of the politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and legislation of quality, but it is lagging behind for its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what was said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the supreme audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us, &quot; said Kala in his commentary of the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control conducted jointly by inspectors czechs and germans also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot; system ≈†varc &quot; by Petr Neƒças. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Mr prime minister has recently said that the ODS was not going to annoy the entrepreneurs with controls; so is this allowed or prohibited ? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot; The law must be applied in a way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent him from acting in an authority responsible going to inspect to require compliance with the law&quot;, notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the control commission of the Chamber of deputies, you mentioned a project of Czech-German within the framework of which have been compared laws in the area of public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it a question specifically ? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control, which we launched it and that was about two years old. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the eu legislation provides for how to manage the procurement and of the national laws in particular, as well as a practice in itself make him more. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have gathered all of this, and although the procedure is not completed yet, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be &quot;the most severe and of better quality&quot;, however, according to some parameters, the practice, as such, is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This therefore confirms that it is not enough to develop continuously rules are more detailed but that it is necessary to devote to the implementation even of the right. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What this project can it help you in concrete terms, and that does it for you ? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should just contribute to this that we stop we strive to specify the laws, to decline and improve the thresholds, if this does not make a really positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means to get the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude all enrichment and possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It could be that this system is at such a point overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation in practice of the legislation on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system control in Germany ? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a mode of organization different ? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> For institutions, similarly to the ISC, works out there in the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions carry out basically in a similar manner . </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance, however, in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has, therefore, also of current accounts of this type at the level of individual States. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds with us to the resources of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds are managed in us by the regions and the municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the current accounts of the federal states. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In regard to the national legislation, it is more simple than ours ? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we certainly can&apos;t say that it has to do better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have the best inspectors ? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is also necessary to say that this country is that we consider a model is also facing a series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, non ? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In regard to the national legislation, that has meant to you, as an institution, the amendment of the act on public procurement, its effects are-they already feel ? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had any impact on our operations of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we controls a posteriori, it is necessary to count with a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our comments relate only, for the moment, the process of preparation of the future checks - we have launched a new instrument of the &quot;detection of the risk of poor management,&quot; with which we sifted through nearly 14 000 public procurement - there these changes will of course feel it, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Is that so, do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration ? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous regulations, the service provider (for example, the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way ? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not that way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not to punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> A system like this will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> So what is the solution to get out of it ? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s look at where we are not going to. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS was not going to annoy the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called system ≈†varc - what does this mean ? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system ≈†varc is it prohibited or allowed ? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in a way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent him from acting in an authority responsible going to inspect and to require compliance with the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can declare: &quot; We will change the law and allow &quot;, but he can tell that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be accomplished and what, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are places frosts, but most remain passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also covered in snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network, however, remains for the most part practicable, in some places with a higher level of vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary region </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this morning passable, but in places frosts and also covered in snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperatures have dropped and range between -5 degrees and -10 C but they should slightly back in the day. </seg>

<seg id="1105"> The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn√≠nice is due to the branches of trees that are bent under the weight of the snow until it reaches the floor. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> ≈†imon Ornest said: &quot; In concert, we want to collect the positive energy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world ? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is only one of these alarming news, the kind of traps into which we fall in love. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh instead, and it is said that we are the only group able to collect the rest of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, you go up in December a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you describe in more detail what the project to our readers ? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years already. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced to the December 21, at 11 a.m. 10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end almost at the moment when will the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the pacific ocean, on a timezone in advance of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who had this idea ? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> In the beginning I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to set, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying online www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group the Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled &quot; End of the world cancelled &quot; (in Czech &quot; Konec svƒõta zru≈°eno &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, the hear-t-on also during these charity concerts ? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the end, finally, if we are successful and that the end of the world has no place ... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The hymns will join also at a given time within the framework of a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The lyrics of this song were written by Tom√°≈° Han√°k who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X y also sings... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How are you coming to cooperate with them ? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We collaborate with other personalities of show-biz Czech, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation, and that it amuses them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> How will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world ? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the training centre Studeo, which is accessible for disabled guests and we are working on the realization in the framework of the institute Jedliƒçka, with the association Tap, and this for the last six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly with students of the institute Jedliƒçk≈Øv and their offer activities that interest them and entertain them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means to go to of course, we try to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the framework of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedliƒçka, we will transfer this project in a new separate building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and performers will perform on stage during each of these concerts ? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria, have you chosen ? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will rise on the scene Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Georg Such√Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Get ready also to other &quot; mega-events &quot; of this kind in the future ? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In may, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague spring; there, too, we will surely a quality program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours ? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not so terrible as it looks at first. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in the electric wheelchair of which the machinery must travel in the cargo hold, naturally we trimbalons also a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Up to now, everything is more or less always well spent, ƒåSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they gave me a surprised more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we bumped recently, everything went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks for your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ for access facilities for disabled guests, attitude of the public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have been your experiences up to now ? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where the whole works better, than at us, we have been witnesses in Moscow that is not all is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet very common that a person moves only in electric wheelchair in the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet consider it as an evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there too, an association striving to attract attention to the problems of people with disabilities is currently being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries ? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things for which we are still late... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements still depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a severe disability move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> This is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in the social life and on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary, to the cutting edge of progress ! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really starts to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group the Tap Tap is currently very popular, let&apos;s go back a few years back, what is it that you pushed in 1998 to create this group ? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedliƒçka, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, a saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music business. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with time, as said by our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success happened that in the course of these years, if I&apos;m not mistaken ? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, the fact of creating links with famous singers and work actively to the promotion of the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to grants from the european Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have teachers of quality, facilities, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap ? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Show business is full of things that were to copy from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In some way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Rare are the original projects, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned of all, that we need to take pity on them. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a life full and flourish, provided you have the necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, this is not only a step forward for themselves but for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Is that your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by many people ? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group the Tap Tap currently has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998 ? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> A single, L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, the people come and go, we can do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the case on the eve of the day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 21 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, to Brno to Fl√©da and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected through relay audiovisual when will be sung together the song of the group the Tap Tap &quot; End of the world cancelled &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to collect financial means (to the tune of 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo, which is located in Prague in the institute Jedliƒçka. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years, the presale of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the european space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member State of the former eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that have followed has participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The route from Poland to the space has, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the second world war, Polish enthusiasts working on space flights; they do not meet always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like to mention for example the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld of the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from the work of avant-garde entitled &quot; Introduction to astronautics &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of the young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later ≈†ternfeld remembered that only the doctor Jan Gadomski turned his attention to his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, ≈†ternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch for his book &quot; Introduction to astronautics &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Said dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics world-renowned, its contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> As early as 1925 was built in Poland a rail car, designed to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> You don&apos;t know, unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket had to be used to propel or slow down the rail car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only known information on this rail car, are those of the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was carried out by the institute Kom√≥rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is apparent from the documents kept that this research had reached the trial stage. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German army, the search was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the plans of a rocket hunting photoelectric, designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski, appeared in the press, and the following year was published the book &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of an author referred to as Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects were intended military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all the projects of use of the technique of the rockets were conducted by the scientific advisory committee provisional (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), which coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other works devoted to the aeronautical were published in the Polish press, thanks to the company astronautics Polish (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a question of a society in the number of November 1954 in the Problem log, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aviation. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company devoted to the cosmonautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had of the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, the company astronautics Polish (PTA) made efforts to enter the Russian astronautics international (founded in 1951) and, from the fall, the PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the federation of astronautics international. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He preserved his office until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the development success of the rocket weather RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first rocket Polish to carry out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket with a range of 1800 metres, and had a length of 80 cm tall and weighed a little less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> By the suite was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, tests of rocket flight, two-storey RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and weighed probably 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The following prototype would have to be able to conduct scientific work, concrete - the rocket RM-34 would have had to have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development works were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The rocket Meteor-1 developed in the course of the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded to the first rockets of type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and 1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for the scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liter. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum capacity of all of these types of gear was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965 - 1968, the rocket Meteor-2 were developed in the aerospace institute, the first test flight began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Thereafter were built versions Meteor-2 and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also appropriate to mention the entrance of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the framework Interkosmos program, Poland has also participated in the space exploration on the soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second cosmonaut non-soviet of this program. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the act on the work of public utility is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional Court repealed the law on the work of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision raised in public opinion a lively discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is definitely worthwhile to consider this issue from a wider point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of greater competition, economic unregulated. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the different economic entities, as well as national business systems are perpetually in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This results from the principle of freedom of trade and the free traffic (without limits) of private capital, combined with a financial speculation rampant. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The significant differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a voltage on the price. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives for the import of the goods sold at low cost to resist the economic competition by &quot; making it more expensive, &quot; the price of the competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to move production abroad, or to buy at lower price, either disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of the work are high in comparison to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and responsibility in relation to the unemployment which it engenders, the social charges of the State necessarily go up. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate the damage to economic and social caused to the society as a whole by this race to profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is at such a point of publicly known that it is not necessary to provide statistical data concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital engender in the various economies, a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to lower artificially the social level of their own population in order to attract them to the foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments set their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is mainly manifested in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective is to compel economically its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, in particular in the field of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints, in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of the labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> This results in an increase in poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In GERMANY, there are years of points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Already by the millions, the number of such people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such salaries as the State is forced to pay extra so that they reach the subsistence minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economies of practically all the member States of the south of the EU generate, without any doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the Nineteenth century), is to plod along with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here we must ask yourself the following question: where will this capital ? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it originates from other EU countries, then poverty will increase from one country to another; this capital may not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, or Africa will continue to work for a fraction of a salary european. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media, claim to be tired of it, that the State may not make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the State may not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It should then ask if the private capital does not influence and, likewise, does not lead today, according to his own selfish interests, the political and at the same time, the State as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there are a lobby virtually all-powerful and present in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> This results in a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In GERMANY, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate the development of projects of laws, law firms closely related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the power does not come from the people, as reported by the constitutions of the western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is manifest that the democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled &quot;the crisis of the roman empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The State had long been in full decline and functions were assigned to it by the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of the bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these positions. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The kickbacks and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voice already sold&quot;... ... &quot; honest people will not be sought in any way to get functions, the result was a time that the State remained 8 months without consuls&quot;.... &apos; We began really to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy, and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man&quot;... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pumped, but it is Cesar, who has transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in ancient times, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In its essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to represent the interests of the society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior elites, without any effort to perform in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> So we must look for the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation of the unscrupulous economic systems of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of things, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of democracies type liberal as a kind of break before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the elites in present completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of human lives, humanitarian crises, and social development that today we are the witnesses as well as crimes against humanity as we know from the ancient and recent history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the act on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of the economic competition, both at international level and at the level internal europe, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look at ways of reducing the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is systemic effect. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution consists of the reforms to be referred to the socio-political, which will strengthen the capital investments of the State in the economy, will increase influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of the monopoly of private capital in the company to the benefit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;There&apos;s nothing that will never go out of violence and never will,&quot; says Sting in the song called Fragile whose towards the main chorus is &quot;let us not forget how much we are fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot; If my sons did not want wars, there would be no&quot;, said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his bed of death in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as usual, many of the reactions are high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some take advantage of Israel, arguing that its right to self-defence, and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel and the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine, and recognising Israel as a terrorist State. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its wave of killings recurrent; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not lived the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a point of view located &quot;behind the curtain&quot;, about the one who primarily benefit from the tensions that have existed already for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a little country in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others out of my own understanding of one, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is above all the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great, or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or as if they were their acts to the throne to someone who was directing their actions according to the objectives defined beforehand. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time where the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of financial generating some powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the families with a wealth of astronomical particularly stands out the Rothschild family, who could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don&apos;t know if these families still have a leader, but I do not rule). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> From the 90s of the Xix century, they have acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts for which they were involved and who had always meant for them to reinforce their power to increase their wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have shareholdings major in most of the central banks of the world and prepare for or carry out wars against the countries in which they do not yet have such interests (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow Gaddafi&apos;s only 4 in the meantime Russia has placed the central bank of russia under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew at the Bank of America Rothschild&apos;s the status of the central bank and began to emit during the civil war his own money (government, I hear), and was murdered in a theater in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, congressman Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the FED to have triggered the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power at the global level has led in the years 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated the 33rd degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war had the objective to eliminate the great monarchies state of Europe, the second was to remove the colonialism, including the british, and the third is expected to reduce the world&apos;s population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing other than the beginning of a solution such as this) and, in the end, acquire absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order to the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid that not repeated crises such as the ones that they brought in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After you have managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne of the austro-Hungarian, they destroyed the tsarist Russia in causing the bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without justification, economic and military (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the breakup of Austria-Hungary, the power in central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For a trigger easier the second world war, the bankers have left the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of enormous repairs of war and creating the conditions for a radicalization of the masses-depleted (it is enough for them then to place an officer energetic enough, pointing the finger at the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (she held it actually) fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the Nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the zionist movement, whose one of the branches inhaled to the creation of a jewish State, preferably in the area of Judea history with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The declaration of Balfour mentioned above has laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local population Arabic began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out; it is difficult to assess if Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had taken initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Europe&apos;s Jews in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of the jewish State by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the repairs of the war imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel has lit a fire can cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the jewish population will be as it was during the second world war, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the arab population or generally muslim in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between the supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where it is located, the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power over the whole world ? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we must make a difference between simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, the international bankers do not offer to the people in the elections as their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel, is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal with respect to the international bankers, who did everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s membership of the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the strait of Hormuz through which transits 20% of all the oil the world (this corridor naval did a width of only 2 miles), and result in the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light appear now the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and the people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which all new born is seen implanted at birth, an electronic chip making him a be totally controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot; They are forcing all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to carry on the hand or the forehead, a mark in the red-hot iron, so that he can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of the beast or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand: that the one who has a good sense account the figures of this ferocious beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: when it all goes to the worse, call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of students islamists took stormed the u.s. embassy in Tehran and held hostage 52 diplomats. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the us administration to a positive outcome, it could not, in effect, give up the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, suddenly aggravated later by the bombing of the attempt of the release of the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats hostages were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate gave rise to the United States with a wave of solidarity and a sense of anti-iranian. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle iranian contributed strongly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the face of Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of the story, who was offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After ups and downs are complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the canadian authorities, the CIA was able to make out of Iran through a cover events: they left the country with a canadian passport as members of a film crew came to make of the locations for the filming of a movie to show great science-fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the expert exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, magazines did state of this film project, press conferences were held, and a production company fictitious had actual offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained a long time secrets, the movie is based on the recollections of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Affleck is an unusual combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic manner but also a &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a hit, a traitor - as, for example, in the trilogy, Ocean&apos;s eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The atmospheres turn: sequences of Tehran documentary-style (in the sequences, subtitled are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events, and the manner in which, through these pictures, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no major differences), </seg>
<seg id="1355"> passages lighter Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> and then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with men dressed discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable manner. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Actor ridiculed, he became a director respected and his acting has continued to attract ironic remarks. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film, after the dark thriller &quot; Gone Baby Gone &quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film Affleck who should not take place in his city of origin, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the standard hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also evidence of this sense the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran &quot;is held&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the movie are taking place in the streets, during the reconstruction of the real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, at a given location, writing a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the scenes fictitious (false, the shooting team in the bazaar of Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much stock in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to settle a matter with the fact that few thrilling scenes in cinematic sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> It gets out of it very well, it adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of a crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the continuation on the runway are quite drawn by the hair). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its character dispelled, due to the need to show too much of events in too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of cooperators hollywood, their characters would have deserved a greater place and not far from there, the only ones in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he will let you see with a moderate degree of interest, enjoying the realization and the retro style of the 70&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It takes the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a history yet, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the character of an exaggeration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas, and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which carries out every year a public inquiry into the bank charges the most absurd, has decided, at present, to launch the contest of the regulation or of the ideas from the &quot; workshop EU&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU is considering, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large european companies has been at the origin of our decision&quot;, said to the newspaper Pr√°vo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the european Court of unifying the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, however, women were at a distinct advantage for this which is of tariffs for life insurance because they are, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report up to the end of the year, while another idea also amazing &quot;the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013&quot;, has informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the regulations controversial of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, and that this has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of cages for hens, which resulted in the increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the expression &quot;butter spread,&quot; or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas quality must have a size of 14 inches. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The eu administration reacts often under the pressure of a lobby commercial or industrial whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (and the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that in the european Union, the bananas must not be of a size less than 14 cm or present an &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The european Commission has defended arguing that it was not that harmonizing national standards in non-homogenous compliquaient trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed in spite of the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the regulations of the EU last year, according to which must be listed on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has made reference to a u.s. survey, according to which the balls are among the toys, the first cause of child death by choking. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age to blow the trumpets of the fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> With us as well, it was bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule concerning the european officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU may not use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot;, and shall, at the place, to speak of FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot;Laissez-Faire&quot; grouping of the liberal economists, the server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities of the above-mentioned, the regulations of the european Union concerning the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set volumes maximum for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic has exceeded then, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms, and ventured, because of this, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to request the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, are not originating in Brussels, but of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact of not having a sea we disability. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union for a refund&quot;. Thus expressed, in the fall of 2004, the minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> It arguait that, as a result of our own production of wheat, and following the purchases so-called &quot;interventionist&quot;, the State was found with stocks full that it had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is situated away from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the european Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for obtaining grants were offered to the public by the ministry of local Development headed by the minister Pavel jan nƒõmec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write applications for subsidies granted by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU declares: &quot;the regulations bizarre are rare&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations are often critical in the member States, according to many experts, the efforts deployed by the EU in relation to the regulation and improvement of the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development, deserve rather praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of the european integration, but that have been imposed by the member States during the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these products traditional (struggle which it does not always a winner) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name &quot;Olomouck√© tvar≈Ø≈æky&quot;, for which the appellation &quot;Tuzemsk√Ω rum&quot; which dates back to us in the Nineteenth century, our producers have had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzem√°k&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the alcohol-based products cane sugar, and not based on sugar beet, may bear the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products to the EU, we find today in the company of cheeses known worldwide such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lubeck or Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarsk√© suchary&quot;), the tents of Poho≈ôelice and T≈ôebo≈à (&quot;Poho≈ôelick√Ω has T≈ôebo≈àsk√Ω kapr&quot;) and the hops ≈Ωatec (&quot;≈Ωateck√Ω chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread Pardubice (&quot;Pardubick√Ω pern√≠k&quot;) and the cakes called &quot;Cones Ho≈ôice &quot; (&quot;ho≈ôick√© trubiƒçky&quot;) can also be proud of their brand community. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to save the Republic, but I am only an amateur, says senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. Senator, how a-t-on the idea of introducing themselves to the presidential elections ? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president, who account for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can not stand to see how the country is being plundered over the last twenty years, that the thieves are not under lock and key and the taxes and the age of retirement is increasing. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I didn&apos;t have the ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like, then I try to provide a solution for it to change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have over forty years of age and that I am independent, a member of any party, I don&apos;t have other ways to influence the situation than to introduce myself to the presidential elections, or to the senate. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You are entered in the Senate but you are quickly put on the road to the Castle (Ndt: the headquarters of the presidency). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it that you do not turn our backs on those who have elected ? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I&apos;ll start it in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the elections to the senate </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Subsequently, I have said that if I was elected a senator, I would trust myself to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, the function is just an instrument allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> This is why I need the influence of the largest and the mandate of the bigger picture. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we as a nation r√¢lons at the bar or in front of our television set, but it is also that we pi√©tinons cough those who are trying to bring about change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the press, which breaks the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It has, for example, said about me that I bribing journalists, or that I was the advisor of Georg Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let&apos;s come to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have initiated the struggle for the Castle, with, as a war-horse of the themes of the material responsibility and criminal politicians and tax returns retroactive beyond twenty million [CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You need to this end, to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem ? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I have been lobbying for the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won the case. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is that the politics: when someone comes to the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all the parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, take each party what is best for our country and put it in the application. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider it rather as a man of the left or the right ? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A point of view, Czech, I have the impression that people put me rather to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this is a bit to the left or to the right, this is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, this is not that people will be left or the right, but to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the communist party or ODS, and I do everything as impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Are you enragez when someone says to you that you are a populist ? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you have said does not prove&apos;t it ? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain purpose and optimal vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to get closer to it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I&apos;m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about this. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, it only remains for you slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You will not survive a long time in politics with this. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you&apos;re going to see the people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose liability and criminal ? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and try to bring them to my camp in order to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on tv my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on liability and criminal politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they didn&apos;t want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there will be a strong personality that will identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, without beating about the bush, to be a lover, not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I&apos;m trying to find allies for my beliefs and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just throw myself in politics and I am attempting to get the support of the majority for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try, alone, doing things, and if it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;ll be staying in six years and I will return in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It&apos;s a bit like if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person cannot make a difference, that is why I went to see a number of people to ask them to present also to the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√° which has revealed the fraud in the oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people have not voted and who did it were, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> In spite of everything, I will contend for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of the regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you planning to build your own party ? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I don&apos;t have the time to check if the past of each potential member is without spot, and then I don&apos;t have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I don&apos;t have no more money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have money ? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk of tax declarations, what&apos;s yours ? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I estimate to be approximately $ 60 million the value of my personal property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have to Prague, with a land value of $ 25 million, an apartment with a value of ten million, another apartment worth $ 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin, which is worth $ 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb with a value of 1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of a kid: I&apos;ve always liked James Bond, who was travelling in the car, was galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You ride in Aston Martin, you have a heritage with a value of 60 million and you don&apos;t have money for your campaign ? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic, but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money ? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have $ 15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I ought to go into debt ? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2 million and a half in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program does not arouse a great interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My fees campaign are broadly covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live, for example to pay the English school my son, who is 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only goal was to win the money, I do not present myself to any election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will, therefore, continue your business activities in order to be able to live ? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you have said that you would put your activities muted ? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people would like that I am a samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Yet, it should be even though I live in something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your monthly salary usual when you were a contractor ? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I was making and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the journal Pr√°va. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly-erected - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find that this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,&quot; we said Lisette Verhaig, a bandwidth-on the down-side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer technician in a large company neighbor, we said: &quot;Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has Internet, iPad, and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody will of his own accord in one of these libraries lame, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a city-dormitory, which was not attractive to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the education rates the lowest of the Low Countries. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city has decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven bridges fictitious which are listed on the euro notes in the form of small lovely miniature reinforced concrete painted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive cultural remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> It is as well that the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to take the lead on statistics: the construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the office of architects MVRDV, Rotterdam, the master of the diagrams in the sticks bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his phlegm usual, and stood in the contest in 2003 with five books under one arm and a sneer on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury looked at each other again, bewildered, and shrugging his shoulders, Maas, the cheeky, empila its books of choice for size order to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by arguments activists by one: &quot;dear common!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung from the earth. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 units. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize of &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus it is that this little village dull, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian area postmodern and a town hall of a ugliness bewildering, whose facades white invite you to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with an architectural masterpiece contemporary. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building cultural public of its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Certainly, an elevator carries you to the heart of the mountain, but the true joys of reading, and that the architecture will open up to you when you touch the ground floor of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior completely made of glass is bright and clear, the brick floor and Dutch street elegant speak the unequivocal language of the public places of the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> One is looking for is already in the eyes of the public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the rays of the library are located along the facade and in the middle is a big room and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely upset the spatial configuration classic and open spaces reading from the inside to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully furnished: in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical centre of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special beauty lies in the black spokes of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience to the sight, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened do not want to unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> This is so that one day we found in a farming business frisian waste ad hoc derived from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the netherlands, it has been using for years of the synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick as substrates in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and it will save time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and then we can discard it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates with a thickness of four inches. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the effect of heat and pressure, the &quot;Landbouwplastic &quot; (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and strong, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sport shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary cafe we offer a breathtaking view of the city, but also food and Dutch and ficus trees in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity in the air of the mountain literary. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Gifts for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is incredible, but in spite of all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in the field of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is set by geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is under a bell-glass, the sun illuminates as little time inside, even when the weather is nice. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams mounted through compared to the glass facade used visor, intercepting a large part of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The blinds completely automated load of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the computer scientist septic the above-mentioned, it is already risky to enter into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig as was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as &quot;the soul finally found,&quot; Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago in effect, during the inauguration, every citizen was asked to donate a book from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This measure has helped to fill in the gaps of the library, which was not yet completely filled (today, it has 70,000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full of all shares. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect, Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a library is half-empty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each and every citizen, and this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> It is as well that MVRDV has reached the discipline mistress called in the professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Even if it may appear young and little-educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is, finally, a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans must play a bigger role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of the palestinian State. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a fragile political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the demand of the palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she was then chosen forbearance. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support the american position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, without, however, being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the insurrection in Libya in march 2011, Germany had also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, the NATO-imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is experiencing, &quot; she difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to say, defined by the Americans and to establish a foreign policy of germany. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are encountering so many fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Is expected of them, they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are groping to find this role, but are on the way of foreign policy &quot;more normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That then means in concrete terms, the term of foreign policy &quot;normal&quot; for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and european partners, including in relation to the national issues. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The economic interests of the germans are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: this is why Germany needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany vis-a-vis the conflict in the middle East and the abstention in the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany was first to significant opportunities in the middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why the Berlin must take care not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites in the arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is undoubtedly a crucial element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I would match not too much importance, because it is not a question of relationship exclusively one-sided. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is there, in any case, a key element in the strategic reflections German. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany night-she&apos;s relations with the United States in choosing abstaining votes are important, such as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that the Americans and Europeans understand perfectly the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> This is why I think that the divide is not so serious as it was in the case of the libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe even that Germany will be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it needs to be taken seriously as an international actor and that his interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions of the palestinian initiative are various. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States have announced their veto in a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of european countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the scene in american domestic policy. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showed great understanding for the european position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But having regard to the political configuration of the country, the government may not, of course, not defend its position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they appear still. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you observe the relationships between Obama and israeli prime minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm with regard to the policy of the Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany feels it difficult to combine his close relations with Israel and the United States, of the one part, with the position of the major european partners, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it does not make things easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Obviously, this would be a bit more easy for the Germans there were a coherent european policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore they cannot register within a line broader policy and must assert their peculiar position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is what they are currently in the issue of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future the role of a locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a european position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> This is not simple for Germany, in particular because of the relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question has always been tricky. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But according to me, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that brand more of their independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself playing a role of an influential player on the international stage, Germany wants-she only assume a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or maybe she still struggling to assume leading roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to that, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still experiences difficulties to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at, for example, the crisis of the euro, we note that each time that Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands are heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not make things easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: we don&apos;t want to be surrounded by countries hostile. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a position to be far more difficult than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must cope with neighbors and opinions very diverse, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the influence of the United States on the eu policy does not only diminish, but at this moment, the EU does not empty, then who is he? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant, and if they are less valued, this is the life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, beauty in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America to analyse together the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he majored in German politics, american foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Trademark Protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Ralph Lauren Polo are well-known brands around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> The name behind a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the company&apos;s original. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand has a protection such as the company that bears the name may not file a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, it is not sure that she would be successful. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China&quot;, explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the right of property in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new file arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So, instead of Gucci, we register Read-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also legally copy, such as Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a workbook in which are the records made with the trademark office of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a chinese company has filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created by appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of mode. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of the copy and the violation of the intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, we find shopping centres, multi-storied do not sell almost as counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents, the task of addressing the fact that the chinese trademark office gives officially to chinese enterprises the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak of the &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, brand parent. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from the &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are referred to as the women who are married to rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The chinese authorities say they have nothing to be ashamed of. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, it is necessary to struggle against this tendency&quot;, requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation are huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs amounting to millions for the relevant sectors, especially in regard to the flagship products expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the data of the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury goods and the one that is developing most rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to write off the questionable records of the registry of trade marks and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch is state of the trial in which the court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name was criticized become a &quot;market reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch we explained that if the complainant did not chance, it may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would have harmed its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Of the famous cases also concern the graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine construction Sany, the same company that had to buy the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This is the reason why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the acquisiteur Volvo used before a blue and white logo similar to that of the BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore, which had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademark office of CTMO in Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the office would have happened in the last year of an &quot;emergency situation in the conduct of the work to a sense of normality found&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of opposition procedures are not treated, would have fallen to 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures are still pending at the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications filing of a trademark application, almost one-third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the office, it is a record, and this means that China stands for the tenth time in a row in the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It would be also for the total number of trademarks, which is 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each record has reported average 1,280 yuan, or about 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle is much more, as illustrated in the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting a plagiarist chinese. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacturing of components of the vehicle to be suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator has been able to maintain its rights chinese on the brand Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault, because the names of the family may not be protected in Germany&quot;, explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The trademark office had therefore dismissed the objection of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has certainly won the case with the two following instances, but the opposing party continued to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Vigilance is warranted </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, he adds: &quot; the procedure is long, nerve-wracking and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other party a &quot;large sum in euros at the six-digit&quot; to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This is one sees that this represents for us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten even spill over into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if imitators of this region accounted for the operation of the brands are not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a chinese producer wanted to drop in Germany the name of the Freudenberg for a company of production of footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned this area, but she could still prevent the deposition. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;vigilance is warranted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advised to German companies to exercise a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, according to them, relying on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather &quot;save as in China which is likely to be protected&quot;, as the saying Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs may be much more important than those of the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle when the last act of the drama legal, the company would have to pay license fees to the other party for the use of his own name, as explained in Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of struggle against aids: type of walk, to sing, to help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and the aids orphans in Swaziland are looking forward to their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Here is the story of a link which crosses more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, you tap your foot: the cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men seek the pace on the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they will find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, the voices of the singers amplify slowly - alto, bass, soprano and tenor -, they will prevail, spellbinding and follow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the conductor 29-year-old lost almost his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures flexibility wild. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years are come, the geneticist in human medicine at the man in the home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy song, every singer has different words, all in a language very exotic: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some regions of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help themselves </seg>
<seg id="1713"> UNAIDS, the United Nations programme of fight against aids, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland has 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40% of the population is hiv positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 aids orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend a secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per least, one can become a sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This amount guarantees a child of money for the school, a school uniform and a hot meal daily to the centre galore. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in zulu, &quot;storyteller&quot;, or even &quot;singer of praise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> No one can fluently speak the bantu language in this region, but all can sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly 10 years, the choir repeats of the songs in this foreign language, it has brought Germany to now make it to his native region: Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because 8,733 km as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the power voice of the choir German. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of people with </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in small huts made of straw or of land and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has washed away their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> To Esitjeni, one can observe a smaller scale the ills that plague the Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection the most high, and life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not accept almost never male circumcision, a measure which, nevertheless, ensures a reduction proven risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is the bearer of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the thirties. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a trip of the group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis have especially seen many of the children in the street on which it lacked not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without a high school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the beginning, it was only a few people who commit personally to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and to provide him with a hot meal per day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But just a year later, the choir was founded &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, an association that deals since then almost professional orphaned by aids Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are sexually transmitted diseases the most common? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial STIS, syphilis, chlamydi√©es and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> STIS are common to HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic lice and scabies belong to the IST parasitic. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the groups mainly concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sexual contact between men, are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five were in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the adult heterosexual, infections related to the chlamydi√©es, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and the human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, there is a rate of infections related to the chlamydi√©es significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to surveys in the eu, the three-quarters of all infections affecting young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the evolution in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen to 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of genitals, pain in urinary tract, white discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do not lead to regularly no pain or other symptoms and so remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubricating or through close body contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> So experts recommend to anyone often changing sex partners to have regular exams. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the IST quickly detected can be healed and the late sequelae can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially to the funds that are reaping the singers with their voices across Germany as a whole, the means accumulate. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman self-assured and always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated in one of their grand-mothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The gogos, it is the so-called old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them can accommodate up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof, and ensure that they go every day to the hour to the school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has no one is hosted in a secure place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just as the two cooks who prepare daily meals to more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, the &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two houses. With the assistance of the organization of american health PSI, the association has organized a screening test for HIV for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;Aids is a real taboo,&quot; explains Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is a subject that affects sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is curious enough, coming from a country whose king has 14 wives official. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for its style of life to be excessive. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in the place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These manners sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV has been observed in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> However, we find condoms at every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, &quot;but almost no one uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote some of the cultural exchange, the chorus of Imbongi go together on a trip every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence, and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the tip of the black continent are still in the time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with white singing in african language is a sign of recognition as it not only results in a good mood and joy, but hard sometimes also a tear to some fearsome border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the singers visit to their downline. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even if it is difficult to find the little village on top of a map, Esitjeni is well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitjeni, you&apos;ll find the light&quot;, say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a journey of 8,733 km as the crow flies, return to Heidelberg, in front of these singers who type of the foot in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Strasse, there is also the light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: the NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The layer of ice that could reach 20 meters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The u.s. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it has frozen water, as explained in three studies published on Thursday in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shade. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is probably due to comets or asteroids that might hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet, says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery may help to understand how the water and other elements essential to life arrived in other regions of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Undetected of the inhabitants of our planet, sensors, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, they send images to the land, such small interstices through which we observe the infinite. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not regarded as a &quot;planet&quot;, according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the telescope, the Spitzer space telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink dots, the more difficult to identify, as are the &quot;new-born&quot; in the delivery room of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The telescope, the Spitzer space telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized &quot;W5&quot;, a name well-bit romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The telescope, NASA&apos;s Spitzer space has photographed the fiery glow of a star is dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The circle in the shape of a donut is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the immense nebula Trifide, at 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The telescope, the Spitzer space telescope has photographed this delivery room galactic. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades, star clusters also called &quot;the seven sisters&quot;, can be observed with the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope puts more colors in value. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this infrared camera, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looking directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a continent land have earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal picture and the infrared camera allows you to observe a hue spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the detectors infrared telescope Spitzer were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the biggest mysteries in astronomy door on the creation of the rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings are the remnants of a moon of Saturn, which has disappeared, there is 4.5 billion years ago without a trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the photographs of the largest and most net that has taken the Hubble telescope is one of the Whirlpool galaxy. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the hue, the photographs of spiral galaxies can become a real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the european southern Observatory shows the nebula Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, to several thousand light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of Trifide comes from the latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the heart sheen of the place of birth of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a pile of space in the constellation of the serpent bearer: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of the two galaxies merge rush towards one another, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you don&apos;t like the abbreviations techniques, you can use its nickname of &quot;the wheel of fire southern&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo from the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of C√©ph√©e. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is located 1,400 light-years and is composed of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the dust domestic current. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo has been prepared on the basis of shots optical and x-ray taken by the various telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> One can see there the circle composed of black holes is 430 million light-years from the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope has photographed for the NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the larger spiral galaxy &quot;GC 1810&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula is the group of young stars the brightest of our milky way galaxy. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The cradle heavenly always gives birth to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by the nebula of the Rosette, also create continuously young stars to 5,000 light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy, the sun&apos;s rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The scientists believe that he was born soon after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our view of the universe: the main telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee to use it a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see deeper into the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Observatory of the mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma in the Canary islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reaches approximately eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly, Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its peculiarity lies in its high light-gathering ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> In spite of a diameter of the mirror relatively small, this ability is similar to those of the largest telescopes in the mirrors of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> The scientists listen to the universe in search of signals extra-terrestrial using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope with a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>

<seg id="1855"> The construction of a european extremely large telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO) in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 items of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not be able to take snapshots before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the biggest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the observatory on Mauna Kea, observing the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new telescope gigantic should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of the mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration helps to admire it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the space-the most important we come from the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, he delivers us with images of the far worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since march 2009, the Kepler space telescope searches for exoplanets, primarily those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that she had found 1,235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo illustrates the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>

<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the space telescope infrared has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be on a mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists believe that the South pole of Mercury is also home to the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data on this theory does not exist, because Messenger orbit much closer to the North pole of Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The radar data indicated, for decades, the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, the scientists now have the certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1900"> And when you think that the oldest person documented was 122 years, the age of M√ºsl√ºmov seems more than doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Shirali M√ºsl√ºmov would he cheated of a few decades in calculating his / her age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, he has also heard of the man at the grand old age of central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;People surprisingly older live also in some regions of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia also, there are men who live incredibly old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof due to the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no register of civil status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Each day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is, however, of the fact that the people of the region, Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guide of azerbaijan, says that the Talysh have specific genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a question of power. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which are drinking a daily glass of melted butter, are good for the health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? To Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the whole region of Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the ground next to a churn, which it beats the content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are for a long time adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children enjoy also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for the guests served in glasses armadus typical in the form of a belly. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth of Mirzayeva, are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that his son reveals to us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always washed my hair with milk, and it is as well that I&apos;ve never lost and that they kept their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I&apos;ve never used shampoo&quot;, adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my entire life, I&apos;ve never bought the lesser food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she talks about her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst times were after the Second world War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything is improved when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took the controls. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda amazing in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the worship of the father figure of the nation, a man who, however, has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham he was succeeded by the suite. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Anyway, the older people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good train of life in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And may be that the son for a long time grizzled of Mirzayeva was right: &quot;the elders have a great respect for it in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the center of the large family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The &quot;rights of man&quot; omitted in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution is reborn in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Events rival reveal the deep fracture of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The egyptian president is not stingy lyrics filled with emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to make a successful transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God&quot;, a-t-he told State television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was intended for the people as a whole, but also especially to the Coptic christian, liberal, enlightened muslims and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all of the members of the opposition confused and desperate d√©sunie are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful muslim brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, have temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional Court and expanded his own &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what he wants to save this engineer 61 years old, holder of a doctorate degree from the american university of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary will it be reversed? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the constituent assembly predominantly islamic 100 people during a tour-de-force night of fifteen hours are indeed disturbing to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the decision is based on &quot;the principles of islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that really means the word &quot;principles&quot; ? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the islamists use the vague wording and the margin of manoeuvre legal caused to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case, it&apos;s that suggests an article newly introduced stipulating that, in respect of all matters related to the shari&apos;ah, al-Azhar university should be consulted. The hotel is in an islamic institution, the most important of the country and its brilliance shines on all the islamic sunni world. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative instrument, which would de facto lead to the under supervision of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the likely military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts employed to suppress the opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State must also, can you read in the project, to protect &quot;the true nature of the egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to promote its corporate and its values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the content of the art cinema and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In the clear, it would be simply to censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In addition, any article not specifically guarantees the equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another article forbidden to offend or defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, the article does not define what is an offense, nor how it must be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the wording implying that it is prohibited to&quot;offend the people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that the minister of interior shall submit to the vote and who, according to his own words, will &quot;very soon&quot; the object of a referendum of the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution renait&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in a concorde unusual in Tahrir square, Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia law before it comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is reborn and we will win&quot;, lance Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel peace prize winner and former chief of the international Agency for atomic energy agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is &quot;to throw it into the dustbin of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Israel of wanting to foment a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;It proclaims the referendum, it will go to his palace and the overthrow it&quot;, exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned for,&quot; said according to the egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition . </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced do not want to monitor the referendum, which would entail its invalidity. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our Constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> From its side, the muslim brotherhood, well-organized, has called for a counter-demonstration was not on the Tahrir square, as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The veiled women and the followers of the salafi, who participated in large numbers, were chanting: &quot;the people calling for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Cleans our country!&quot;, asked to the minister of interior, stating that &quot;the Qur&apos;an [was] Constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A fight for the sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where it all began, would have quickly led to a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, this is what the supporters of the minister of interior and wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The muslim Brothers have stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way that his followers were cast loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box of the direction the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of the islamists will definitely the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned a single time&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed that would have had to extend until February and encompass all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The lawyer of the human rights of 48 years old and president of the egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR), had defended the muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in front of the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he was sharing their conception of the world, but because for him, the human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> This is the reason for which he has been beaten, tried and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution&quot;, regrette-t-il during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of the minister of interior and to the three powers, has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are glaring violations of the rules of democracy, and they will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president removes de facto all its powers&quot;, deplores Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Nevertheless, a democracy can not function without the civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels left out, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could be paid for. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protester on the site Tharir warns: &quot;you give birth to a monster that it will no longer be possible to control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk of Norway: is it the fish the most fragrant of the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the premises for a fish extremely fragrant? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take cheeses advanced. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a pile of clothes football wet and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, dishes the most sought after areas of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It&apos;s snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a period - according to the scent that you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When the darkness sets in and it is cold, the Norwegian gather en masse to attend a festival which has been held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this culinary specialty incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Harvard Halvarsen, firefighter local full-time, also known as the &quot;Rakfisk General&quot;, responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, the people swallow small pieces of fish, and will put a large quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk&quot;, adds Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid doing so pass under your nose, this is not bad - it makes me think of a sushi which would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water-tight to the air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once properly fermented, the fish is released and - no doubt with the sense undermined by the alcohol - ate. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating, mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a system of complete health. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there not so long ago richer than Norway, crossing the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, of the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is part of the dishes more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 euros each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway did not often talk about it in the news international, which is not to displease him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who has killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about this slaughter, they talk about the &quot;incident of 22 July&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have trouble accepting that in their country and the pacific, the one of their own has been able to commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the beginning of the 70&apos;s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason which justifies our success,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, blonde hair and blue eyes piercing, the image of the well-being nordic, with a tray of rakfisk hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how to say-you - cautious people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discrete, we do not like us to notice. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries were throwing money out of the window, in the course of the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has been able to keep the cords of his purse tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can ski in the winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk&quot;, she adds in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and I line up to buy me something to eat - I&apos;ve had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a burger made up of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stayed is one of the many places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or, perhaps, for the most fragrant of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV show where the presenter has a bow-butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It is like the Eurovision song contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What&apos;s the score have you given to the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here are our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We hear laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> As the incoming Chairman Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, focuses on the challenges ahead and to the expectations of the people, who are many. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The traffic in Mexico city is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam safety has been put in place since Monday, blocking several road access key in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent persons from going to work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the scarf presidential to become the new president at the head of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead of him. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, the results that we owe to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost the lives of around 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the people of mexico : to reduce the violence,&quot; said Mr. Pena Nieto the american President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before you introduce it to the american president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populated and sprawling which surrounds the capital. On its frontier, the opinions about this new leader are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A man live </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the common picturesque Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The local attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the town, you can take one of the new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates emblazoned with his name is hung on the outside of a new sports complex and an interactive museum impressive dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to put in place lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economics in particular, we expect a real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of the congress Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects the criticism of opponents who claim that the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It is a whole man, very committed, with a great vision for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> To Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of the Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to help in the fight against the gangs of drug, which operate in the districts, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone, was found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women who were murdered in the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico, whereas Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has not managed to curb the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration to refuse to see reality in the face. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this area dilapidated, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back his tears when she shows me photos of his daughter defunct, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version states that a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family think she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at it, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,&quot; the Lady of the Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigor mortis had already begun. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana decorates the wall, next to a cross where is the word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is exactly what the family was denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities me were treated as if I was an old woman, a fautrice disorder, a pleurnicheuse. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and it is silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But this is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When the President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, it will be a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his top priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it will be as good as the president, when he was governor,&quot; said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, according to prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of child abuse, including Bradley Manning to have been the victim during detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial door on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the sequestration of Manning was made in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information from the history of the us army -- has missed many opportunities to complain of ill-treatment which he claims to have suffered during his detention in the military. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Shift. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- in the course of a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the case Manning to be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was made in very difficult conditions and has built up a punishment severe enough -- took place a day after that Manning has expressed its desire to commit suicide while in detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This analyst of military intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein has examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to isolation prison maximum of July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers asked questions to Manning and have recorded their answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning has recognized that the treatment that have booked him his guards was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had been at the prison was generally &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not show any complaint for ill-treatment, although the officers were directly questioned about his treatment in prison, said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not documented the problems discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote, &quot;no problem&quot; (after having addressed the concerns), and so far, this does not mean that I did not raise problems,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why he had not complained of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission, which was convened to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed by written a few months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his status restrictive indicating a &quot;risk of injury&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military reported that it had assigned this status restrictive -- a level below the close monitoring of the risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted it possible for me to remove this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and has fainted once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact of not having been informed of what was going to happen to him, or of what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in this cage,&quot; said Manning, Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only objects to which it was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing, and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He tried to stay in motion, because sleep or lie down during the day was contrary to the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, it was a light in the eyes, turned on the outside of his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they were waking up in order to be able to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning has filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Friday also, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that, after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates, one morning, during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, it has not been possible to cover with a blanket during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to let go of its cover, which would be able to hide her nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked on the previous night, because it would have been trying to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning is reported to have said to the officer that he would have been able to use the elastic of her panties or its flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done it. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will take into account the experiences during his detention and that it will greatly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defence said that Manning will plead guilty of less serious crime and to fight for the neglect of other charges that were considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees to Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges brought against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defence. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all of the charges are upheld, it shall be subject to the criminal imprisonment for life. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identity crisis mexico-u.s. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexican difficult times, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette said that the Mexico-americans are finding themselves caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico city, arriving in the hall, in front of the services of customs and immigration, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two channels: one for the &quot;Mexicanos (&quot;Mexican&quot;), another for the &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreign&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing to what file to direct me. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in the centre of California, where I was called the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is a qualifier ethnic, in the same way as the one that my friends from Boston to use as they say, &quot;irish&quot;, or my friends in New York when they say &quot;the italians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then, I became the &quot;Mexican-American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the earth that has given birth to my grand-father, there is no need qualifier special or hyphen. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native, and I can&apos;t lose my american accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my american passport, and I am directed to the file &quot;Foreign&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at that time of the week when the new mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto has paid a visit to President Obama, to the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs, and commerce. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risking the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to be allied to the United States and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but also in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing the half of their territory to the tip of the gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. formula for the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma&apos;s looking for a fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship, the more difficult is the one that the country maintains with more than 35 million Mexico-Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want it addresses the topic of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and its losers, of persons to which the country offers opportunities and others for which the country do not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that explains the large number of mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and San Antonio, is that at a given moment, in our family tree, a person may be a parent or grand-parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more often than not, this person was a profile type -- a dark skin, less educated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we currently live the american dream, that we went to good schools and that we have a good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the american dream that we live in, and not the one of the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We give to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that a part of the elite mexican among the ruling class does not love us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them a humiliating defeat and they we toisent as if we were individuals of strain lower and not enough mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we do we will not get stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as of the lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because the Mexican assert more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although she is an american citizen, she has the sense to be part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Furthermore, many of the Mexico-American that I know do not have the impression of being part of a country or the other. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we consider us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we consider them as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate a little more about the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some leaders in the mexican and a part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico-U.s. working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our fellow americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that is definitely worth a visit and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption, and violence related to drugs which are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You&apos;ll need to fend for themselves, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the Member-States of the way they have handled the Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some of the Mexico-U.s. want always to the way in which members of their family have been treated there not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old quarrels, the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another outpouring of blood seems to indicate that such hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While persist the same arguments futile to know who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; over 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv-jaffa, city in Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The arab spring has it all shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> May be that their struggle will intensify even a little more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Nevertheless, there are all reasons to think that this could help to get out of this dead-end life-threatening. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser nor winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire granted on November 21, maintains, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of the force, of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement which runs the Gaza since 2007, is targueront to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has suffered a drubbing. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> To have killed some of its leaders and repressed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the corners to be the most miserable and overcrowded living conditions of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is gaining ground on the west bank, the other part of Palestine is currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other faction palestinian more moderate. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of the islamists in the arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power in full swing, formerly the allied muslim closest of Israel, has taken up the cause of the Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the states of the richest and most dynamic of the Course. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The Hamas members were ecstatic and say that the growing Islamist will curve around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has exercised its domination, passing through Syria, where the rebels to islamist tendency can reverse Bashar al-Assad, and up to the Jordan, where the allies of the Hamas threatens the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the muslim brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Israel in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most central of the arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its collapse in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the muslim brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the diplomatic future, Hamas may emerge as an important global player which cannot be excluded even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> During this time, the supporters of the hard-line Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, the Hamas has been given in the box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The system of interception of missiles baptized Iron Dome has proved its efficiency and many missiles of Hamas have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis are going to be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain period of time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unwavering support; and many european countries have accused Hamas of being at the origin of the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But most of all, Israel has flourished, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been affected by the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier, which encroaches on the west bank, the main piece of what could be a palestinian state, and that protects the jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in the field of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with a party even more hawkish, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election on 22 January, the beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why pamper those damn palestinians by giving them a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they were in the west bank, will launch&apos;t they rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is best to keep them behind the wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It may be that the supporters of the hard-line will prevail; but it may be that the arab spring changes the game. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the islamists come to power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is more important than the one of its four arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower local will not help the new arab governments to arrange their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Govt has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire that bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think about the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the arab world that becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit as the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression weakens already democracy in the jewish state, and the demography exacerbates this problem to the extent that the arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The missions bloody against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be pushed by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains the one promoted by the reasonable persons that are found on each side, and by most of the outside world, and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and in the short term, is that the cease-fire will give the opportunity to persons external to defend this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the flow of weapons to Gaza, in the same way that Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders and with exchanges of land and Jerusalem shared. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arab countries outside should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute much more to the creation of a palestinian state that the proposal next pseudo-state of the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama has also any interest in what Israel is willing to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term in office, he has not presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a vision very narrow. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This happens for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws for packages of cigarettes neutral entered into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the packages green dark that are all identical, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colours have been replaced by a green olive dark and horrible pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by smoking of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Outside of the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the most strict regime in the world in regard to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The australian federal government has said that the purpose was to discourage young people from smoking in removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there&apos;s a 99% chance that they never start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco manufacturers through their brand image&quot;, said the federal minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associated crown of a logo to a princess.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Even if Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes had little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against this act. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco manufacturers have said that this relaunch the trade in black market, which give easy access to cigarettes less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;Negative consequences will result from this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The forgers of China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have said that the law had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd., a small family business, has stated that the application of cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has increased greatly in the two months ago since that British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost before the high court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Iba has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is pending renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the portion of the population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship, and the obligation of dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned the advertising on the Web by the companies and the local sites, but it can not prevent foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you do not have more than a small storefront to promote your products, the Internet is the place par excellence,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in the contributions of some of the citizens lambda in favour of the brands on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We need to ask ourselves if it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who gave the money to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulations in force, rather than on the marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry went up to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries have reported to the WHO that the trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has been significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries in dealing with similar legislation on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make obligatory the photos of the warning on the packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More severe laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and thou ranges package&quot;, said Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package which contains a photo of tumour of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be honest, the only reason that will make me stop, this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult for the storage of packets on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now, it takes me four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government only had to ban it once and for all and we would have said OK, it is good to be stopped and put the key under the door,&quot; he added, raising his arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it can be good to get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of the other plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I&apos;m not going to lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the shops of duty free). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child are praising the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain paths, interesting, or even feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we know no more of the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So should we accommodate the trouble with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First, like many people, I thought the fix was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of history in greco-roman at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The trouble goes back very far,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii include graffiti Latin, which evoke the trouble, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then, there is the definition that we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After traveling many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the boredom as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but without being able to engage in an activity satisfactory.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not going to undertake a task well as she would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he said, there is not the desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of boredom, he said, it is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But the Professor Eastwood has said that if the two can be linked, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think that we are bored, when it is in fact a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In the course of their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; in September, the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have demonstrated experience oldest in which the participants were listening to the tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard, from the room next door, the sound is too high a TV show that had no connection, others have just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all heard the soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the TV to a low sound level have said that they were more annoyed than the other two groups - they have been struggling to concentrate, but did not know why, and have attributed this problem to the concentration of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to focus on a task that is difficult or involved, a lapse of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you perform a tedious task, &quot;as the look of objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bother you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, at present time, we know that when we squirms, or that we scribble, these gestures, often considered to be signs of trouble, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wiggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving,&quot; said the Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We miss all of one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotone, a film particularly annoying. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to get bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;Scale of predisposition to fix&quot; in the 80&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes claims such as, &quot;Among the tasks that I do, a lot of them are repetitive and monotonous&quot;, and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&apos;t have the time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, the researchers discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have need of stimulation many and varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, adolescents are quickly bored. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 young people and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32 percent of teens reported bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent said get bored when they were not at school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of the parents said get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> The professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level&quot;, particularly because children and adolescents do not have a lot of control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I rest my question: the trouble is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as the studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> In contrast, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, &quot; said the Professor Vodanovich, which is studying the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The trouble is the way that the brain has found to make you know that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what the thing is most appropriate to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it does annoy more, but it will not have learned to deal with it all alone or autor√©gler, says professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this autor√®glement passes from one situation to another&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more master of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we should glorify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not believe that we should criticize it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable outside of boiling constant generated by the activities and the technology is the goal to which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to have a bored more often, but the trouble awakens a desire acute and frantic to be connected to something that makes sense&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are searching for, it is a way to disconnect and enjoy the time off. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimul√©s&quot;, he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stopped.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive to the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, student in a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border of Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After that the police officer has found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that may be used to its consumption - minor offenses, each with a fine of $ 100 - and a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals&quot;, said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is there one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on the place of the act. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been filed without further action. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have ceased to indict adults 21 years of age and more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who are in the districts most conservative of Colorado have called to accelerate the business of marijuana existing and continue to charge the people who possess it. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the State in their neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what the future holds for us&quot;, said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The regulatory agencies of the State of Washington is also pose a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are looking for instructions on how to install a system of permits, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute, and sell it prior to the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that the Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most of the states in the field of regulation on marijuana, first of all regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now in regard to the personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could base, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, which is called the I-502, shall take effect on the 6 of December, which leaves a gap in the law of a year, during which the permit system, there will always exist not, then the possession of marijuana will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> During this time, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state, which guarantees access to appropriate marijuana authorized and prohibited the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius of a school, a park, a playground or a crib. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no places more difficult than the urban areas to install a registered trade-sale of cannabis, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for the legalisation of cannabis, a research group formed recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the chief of the police, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the &quot;City attorney (public prosecutor) do not continue more people 21 years of age and older, who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop to charge people for this kind of offence &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions, which regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney (public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision of a more strict. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to attend to the business of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users so that they are clean. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to institute proceedings against these persons who have committed an offence which, at the time of the facts, was an offence recognized,&quot; said Dr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions were complicated even in places rural as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of the restricted consumption of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction is the largest city in the county, does not appear to adults for possession of limited quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the public ministry of the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the business of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t feel like wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it is changing,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and appropriate government to the personal consumption of marijuana is not an easy thing. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different u.s. cities, highlighting the deep ambivalence among local officials in relation to the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a cultural barrier&quot; with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people charged with consumption of marijuana and which is expressed as a local spokesman of the &quot;National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws&quot; (national Organization for the reform of marijuana laws). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent a good part of their life to prosecute persons who consumed marijuana, also, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As a first states to deal with the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are set to become a court case for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While the defenders and representatives of the State to provide for a new border sales legalized, they are waiting with concern the guidelines of the federal government, which designs always the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice handed over. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some arrests profile of patients under medical marijuana and sellers, the federal government has allowed the shops on the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police is probably not going to push the doors to enter small packets of drugs, it&apos;s a safe bet that it opposes the shops approved sale of marijuana for personal use allowed by the new legislation, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities and towns of Colorado have not expected that the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Well before the vote, some local administrations have approved moratoria on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year deferral. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of up to 6 months, and should impose this ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves faced with a problem the federal&quot;, said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I&apos;ve been battered and excluded from Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> These are not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I&apos;ve always wanted to enter the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother were studied in what, to me, was a prominent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times, which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Nevertheless, two weeks after I installed in Worcester College at the end of the 80&apos;s, to study the history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started crying. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were baffled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard has claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the next room to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. N. Wilson said with fac√©tie that I was part after being forced to drink cups and chipped. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation, and is the subject of constant harassment. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name, rather outrageous, nor because of the fact that I had a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for one reason and one reason, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was the victim of a racist behaviour and barbarian: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was advised a very influential Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why mention this today, you might say. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of the centre-right has the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The hate growing and institutionalized students Tory at Oxford is such that the last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, in the same way as those of gay men, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The conservative members of the hall of the students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they declared that they were &quot;often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable&quot; because of their political opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want there to be a representative in the university Committee for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two on &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;The country of wonders: Young, Intelligent, and Right&quot;), devoted to the policy among the students, and which pictured the &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentrics and neo-nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> We discovered, in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) &quot;, which moves in a Rolls-Royce, features a full silver and moves with a cane head chrome. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say be treated as scapegoats of the establishment of the increase in tuition fees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of the &quot;Nottingham University Conservative Association&quot;, told a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a bias to the left growing in the universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have met.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history at the Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR with regard to the persons who are of the centre-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is an obstacle to the freedom of the debates intellectuals, as well as to the well-being of the members,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I&apos;m entering in September 1986, I was then 18 years of age and a crippling shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted in favour of the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was charged with vibration stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students were acquainted with each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm toward students Tory, but that in addition, they were fun. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, the privatization and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classroom. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm that I was the victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost a foot. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man with the face pustular, was impatient easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is that the Thatch√©ristes refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears burned her eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you take a French course during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends&quot;, he launched a tone snappy. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I went back in my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At dinner that night, I&apos;m sitting all alone then I felt a light tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in the second year of English studies, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are&quot;, he said, kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I fear that it should be so. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken to target. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the young Tory claim to be of Labour (labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted on the fact that I didn&apos;t agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This ploy has failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in the first year of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You&apos;re contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Tories do they love?&quot; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They beat each other, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same points of view-only after dark of the night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Would I have had to become Labour and to deny my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years to come would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was foreign policy advisor of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speech. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was hardly ever there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place provincial and insignificant, and its accession to the point of view of marxist-deterministic of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted the post of professor at Bilkent university, Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; me-he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents &apos; house in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends city dwellers more open-minded. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all the political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best place in the world&quot;, to me he said pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not do it, not in the city bell towers dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends communists had ways blameless. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Leave them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that this is to tease you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> This made me break her heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a work session will be directed to the following week, when another professor of history has suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Blushing internally shame, I admitted to being a victim of brainwashing of my parents and made of the &quot;old fools&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father who has impacted the last nail in my coffin oxfordian. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At this time, he wrote two columns in the press Murdoch each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I have been lurking in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers were abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I have never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me the wimp crybaby. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no child of 18 years should not be the victim of such a bullying in the school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The more tragic is that it was at Oxford, that not only has produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also has an unwavering reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefer the elegance of the reputation &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In the framework of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: a Master of Couture &quot;, opened this week in London, ABC has asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza museum and other clients of the famous Italian fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the british capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has recognized during the inauguration of the &quot;Valentino: a Master of Couture&quot;, a retrospective prestigious which brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house in the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this palace,&quot; he said, with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a history in which the only protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the world closed and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, which is open until 3 march, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing by the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>

<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Rodrigue d&apos;arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed by the timeless,&quot; says the Italian aristocrat who shares his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>

<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist, Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the Twentieth century, &quot;the return of the clients of the high society&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The business of the hardest in the world: the mules human Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the holders of the indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health wearing 70 kilograms of sulphur through the paths of the rock steep. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom work is a hell, and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, a 400 minors who earn their living by carrying the sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the East of the indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He has to work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the gas sulfuric emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After you have harvested large rocks of sulfur, which weigh a total of almost 70 kilos, it installs in two bamboo baskets for it to load on his shoulders through the steep paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the carriers exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a pace of a turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to his death in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago . </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, it will spawn a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were animals in a circus, and bearing trudged the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 miles to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and, we may say, its employees, to which it pays 662 indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> She then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in the daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we carry about 70 kilos, we gain about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million euros) to each trip&quot;, explains Anto, who usually performs three trips per day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Each takes 3 hours and it ends exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of the miners is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro per day) and where the average monthly wage is of two million rupees (167 eur), &quot; says the carrier who formerly worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (eur 6.20 euros) per day, and the job was not as difficult, but Anto is back near his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: &quot;I have married a young girl of Bali, where they are hindus, and I took it back to Java for that she converted to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At the age of 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already started to make him pay the bill even though it covers the face with a mask and wearing special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I&apos;m going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French&quot; promises-t-il in English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this young, friendly and smart could be a tourist guide, server or a receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares a hovel of wood contaminated with other carriers, gets up every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to enjoy the night, when its yellow color characteristic becomes blue and shining in the midst of the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the dark, Anto down into the crater in enlightening with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 carriers charge baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> In spite of its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to holders who are self-employed and are paid to the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In addition, they do not affect either a sub of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the input of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro), that the guards of this natural park to charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is done for the animals, not humans,&quot; said Madrusin, a carrier portly 42-year-old who works at Kawah Ijen since the thirty years since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that it will not stop working &quot;as long as it can&quot;, because he needs money to raise her 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur affects the throat and irritate the eyes when the wind turns and trap the minors in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer from serious diseases... which is of course in addition to their usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, bent with the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing a basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his fellow extract 15 tonnes of sulphur of the volcano, only three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 km away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; says Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of five children, aged 30 years, also works as a bearer of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one that make the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore search babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans throw the responsibility of the lack of the child on the career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore must develop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife, and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these words come to an advertisement for breath mints, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube to Singapore early this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like &quot;Let&apos;s put a bun in the drawer&quot; for mocking the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of the video, hopes to attract attention to the problem of fun way through this advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of the music for people to &quot;fulfill their national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the field of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a topic that we are discussing. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like launch of perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas are creative but they do not necessarily have worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we said the following: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore does not have as much to the light. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriage and fathers grants of up to 15,000 dollars per child, longer maternity leave, and distributes profits tax. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city-state&apos;s rich and high technology of South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time that it has found above 2, regarded as the rate of renewal, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans don&apos;t they have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the policy of marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, says that this is due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and family formation&quot;, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and births, which results in a decrease of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increase immigration to counter the decrease of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, we find Web sites that abounds xenophobia barely disguised against the new immigrants, especially to the chinese, who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore has experienced last year, its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they have tried to fix the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a country, the income tax, health costs and the immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, this has begun to touch the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development have begun to monitor the number of small apartments, known under the name of &quot;shoe-box&quot;, which can be built in specified areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have an area of 46 square meters, and their sale has proved very successful. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are worried by the fact that they can promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are selling much faster than the bigger lodgings. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much more rapidly than those of larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to proponents, who was previously a spoke in the wheel if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If so much is that the new regulations could be a step towards the increase of birth rates national, in discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they&apos;re not going to have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, it is for this that the people again later&quot;, says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time&quot;, we declare another young man of twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> This is a private off-line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or &quot;the field of private life that we can protect it from any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> That is-this-which falls within the private domain to the under 16 years of age? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in the daily life and social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Understand the dangers to which it is exposed in broadcasting on the Internet of events which it does not share certainly not out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeri√≥dico has questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases, they have been associated with the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on the personal level and &quot;the password and user name&quot; when they applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I will not reveal my secrets more personal in a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when it tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he owns an account for the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are secrets, very secret, my mother can know them but not all of the world&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB, I post images nice or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discussed with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I will not share any of my pictures or someone who would be the fool&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish photos obscene, skinned individuals, or crimes write comments humiliating or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as its new followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His mother is a part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they answer me, I will post them simply&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, so fast,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He says he would never request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> It will not trust someone who would recommend a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14 years old, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, on the latter, he admits to not knowing 20 of the people listed on his friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I am not concerned about it because we have something in common, music by example&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the young boy, nobody has made advances nor has he asked for her address or telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;To me they were putting pressure or required by, I&apos;d delete just my account&quot;, he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A close friend of a friend of mine has been rackett√© on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He has only spent in private profile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He explains to us then a series of steps to configure his / her account in a safe manner. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young / she posts pictures of knowledge in situations that are uncomfortable or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do if I was angry or upset. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even if I know that it is of cyberstalking&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and teenagers, one must understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has arises as a way to seek information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,&quot; said she. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras reports that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in education from the university of Yale university and author of the book &quot;Natives and digital immigrants&quot;, these terms are used to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives, these are the children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, we are the digital immigrants who have to be there to teach them, so that we ourselves are in the process of learning,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He adds that the topic is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a criterion set to what it should be or not to disclose, publish, or say, at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We ask them also to be selective so that what is important to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the privacy of children and adolescents is to use questions that make you think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do it serves no&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you never would tell it not to a stranger, why do you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you like it that they publish a picture of you as a friend that you have published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other post on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identify pictures of the parties, requests you to other people permission of the invalid? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone does it need to know what you are doing in each moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they need to be online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, each one must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on the social networks&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary school teacher and counselor of education, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the terms of use of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Including each of the words, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age and what he is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According Guardia, it is necessary to remind the children that it is not necessary to talk to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of the Unasur is completed without the Lima Declaration is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The Life of the presidential summit of the Union of south american nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe has tried several times to access the document signed during the Life Ordinary Meeting of the heads of state and government of the Unasur, but the ministry of foreign Affairs and the presidency were reported at the outset that it would be disclosed after the closing of the summit, and then said that it would be released from one moment to another on the Internet site of the peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in the brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of journalists to information about the summit has been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the assembly&apos;s presidential election with the message &quot;private session, audio restricted&quot; was broadcast in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated between the journalists were those given by the press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur, which were present at the appointment, with the exception of the spokesperson of peru. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The unique document disclosed during the day was the list of the presidents present, which has caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of the president Humala and non-official document that has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd summit, South American-arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been urged by the press, it did not broadcast the statement also called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, one can verify that the document has been published in the month of march. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international meetings, the peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission safe for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit was also concluded with a joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague, which slice a different border between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pi√±era, gathered at the appointment regional, and have said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of the two parties in the trial that Lima was filed against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and will carry out the verdict, which will resolve the dispute that we wear today in front of such an international court&quot;, said the president Humala, to the side of his chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals&quot;, added the president Pi√±era giving a handshake from the president Humala, next to the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after the British denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua she considered to be seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales and Argentina&apos;s Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, has been charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and the closing of the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The representative has read the final document in which it announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of the 31 projects had been fixed between the south american countries for a total of 17 million u.s. dollars of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, it was mentioned that the countries of the Unasur put in place of &quot;important steps to achieve the purpose of the citizenship of south-american by the development of agreements on residence permits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It has informed, that actions will be put in place to improve the &quot;cooperation in the fight against the urban insecurity and against the international organized crime, actions for a better accessibility to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a matrix triomphaliste but should help increase our matrix productive and a glimpse of a better future for our people&quot;, the president concluded Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects which enhance the free areas of South America, especially in the rural areas and border... by uniting our countries and in generating new economic circuits,&quot; said peruvian president during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, it was noted that five were related to the Peru and stood on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast up in Brazil, and that two were free more important with the Equator although he did not give further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the election process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of south american Nations&quot;, which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for the Latin America remains a region of peace and prosperity, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another subject discussed at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos said, before the start of the appointment regional, he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico city to calmly discuss the dispute sea through a judgment of the ICJ asked by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with president Daniel Ortega,&quot; said the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with the Nicaragua which will ask to have a discussion with this country&quot;, he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to the president Ortega that we will resolve this in a most civilized and respectful as possible&quot;, added the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico city, where they planned to attend the taking of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Rock Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> In the same way, in the framework of the summit, the ministers of Defence of the block will meet prior to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which attempts to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of advocacy in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru ensures the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,&quot; says Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which &quot;the South America, in this case, was to follow the example of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The president Correa, who has participated in the sixth summit of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State-run television, TV Peru, that the Europeans &quot;were killed each other during the Second World War&quot;, and in other conflicts, &quot;but that they were now almost a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, it has defended the project to establish a citizenship south american encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any south american country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas that reactionaries we want to belong to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, the president of ecuador is shown in favour of the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of decreasing the influence of the anglo-saxons and take into account the signatories of the pact of San Jose on the rights of the man. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who we rebattent the ears do not compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the south americans, have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-american Commission on human rights is located in Washington, under the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed its principles, but it has otherwise complied with its &quot;deep democratic values and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> It was concluded that at the time, &quot;there were grounds to suspect according to which Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, it provides a critique of the justice Swedish who demanded that he submits on its territory to an examination in respect of a sexual offence alleged then that &quot;the clean Swedish legislation allows this to be done by video conferencing, which could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa has said there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little problem in the lungs, but nothing serious,&quot; said the president of ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is getting worse by the fact of being trapped in a small space without being able to do exercises in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This is on the health of anyone,&quot; he concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa out that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since the month of June in the ecuadorian embassy in London, that would be the assignment of a safe-conduct which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden, and the european judicial authorities and he points out that there has been some discussion in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not bargain with the rights of the man, we don&apos;t use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden, and the european judicial authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Waiter, has launched a series of procedures from different european bodies&quot;, he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thinks that &quot;if Britain granted the safe-conduct from tomorrow, this would come to an end&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if the Sweden, as did allow its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, interviewed Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or the interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of the freedom of the press, and he made it clear that it is not condoned, not was &quot;the poor, the bad faith and the lies that adversely affect the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the politicians malicious or perverse but the bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> From this angle, it welcomed the fact that this is not that kind of journalists &quot;nor the bankers or the hegemonic countries and bourgeois which dominate in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than put in before his re-election, &quot;it would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and draw the right track&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain a veto on the Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that it &quot;had to be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the attempts of coup disguised&quot;, because in reality, &quot;it is undermining the legitimacy of democracy in paraguay&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> What is more, the president of ecuador considers as &quot;perfectly relevant,&quot; the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the international Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a south american country and a central american countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is necessary to solve in their set to surpass and go forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he said he was confident in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and it has warned that &quot;it is beneficial that the Latin America seizes the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as to whether farm it to be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility, &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has assured that, if it lost the primary to February 2013, it would withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> At a personal level, the power has never appealed to me, but in situations as unfair as those of the Equator, poverty and socio-economic cannot be resolved only by means of political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that it was me that made this possible victory but we have to accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, this would be my last presidential term and I&apos;ll then the political life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we ever lose it, I will do it also. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is my decision&quot;,-he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talk with the vice-president of venezuela Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned, and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of president Chavez&quot;, he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of State of ecuador has participated today in Lima at the Life summit of heads of State and government of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to support the progress, equality, and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Aids-related deaths are today due to late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: hiv-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen on the head,&quot; he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it &quot;less heavy&quot;, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man had hidden in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to load the only one of his disease, and started reading about it, and his determination has been such that it has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without any doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of the HIV hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years old, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90&apos;s, where there were a lot of doubts, with little choice of treatment, and more of stigmata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided the need to tell him goodbye &quot;because he was without a voice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In that time, have aids was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their illness, many people are still coming when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of aids in the world, in all the cases after the first reported cases, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the population in general will be exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the unit for HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and takes it for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a scientific publication prestigious. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV/aids, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that aids was not a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 count of 200 and for up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4 cells. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> To speak simply, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis of HIV positive to 25 years, &quot;as long as it remains under control, will be able to live without problems until 75 years old,&quot; explained the scientist asked. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to place this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the population is now 76 years old, on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people died as a result of aids rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of the UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of aids, 60% of patients, identified on the basis of national data are deceased. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Nothing in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 dead until may of this year; however, we are also assured that the access to anti-retroviral medication is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Then why are there still death? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem does not come from access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is the way I see it, this is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the last 12 years at least, we never ran out of drugs, the problem is that the patients coming to the stadiums very advanced because they do not know they are infected, or so they learn to be in advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine out of ten patients arrive so that they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, it is perform diagnostics earlier and, for this purpose, it is necessary to propose testing a massive scale, and to all persons who ask for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> The specialists and the members of the State Council of aids prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has had to give her a screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, in spite of his young age, he was already a carrier of the aids and was suffering from kaposi&apos;s Sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have aids. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I&apos;m going to die, it is better that I broke three times a week,&quot; they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but the co-lead, I pay attention to me and to the other person,&quot; says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with the MILLENNIUM JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, when walking out of the World Day against aids. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know early on if they are hiv-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like all the world, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against aids in this year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms over the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara, which has embraced the cause of the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all the places dedicated to this, &quot;we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we can offer packages of a hundred, it is all very well, but it follows, that even today, some do not have access to condoms&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections, we find the teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;what are you gonna do with it?&quot;, asked with sarcasm and value judgments by the social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists, and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, ensures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It offers to redirect this distribution ineffective; and that condoms are not only sold to the counters, but they&apos;re found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that they frequent the young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It does not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It does not pay to them the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor Emilio Gonzalez when he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within its administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This is not how it works sexuality, the better is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active&quot;, he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 cases cumulative (12,158 aids and 1,317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new cases and cases of cumulative aids and 13th for the number of HIV sufferers. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are through sexual transmission, 6% through blood and 2% by perinatally. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each case registered, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgment ratified on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro granted via a bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a previous bad for all the national companies with branches in the neighbouring countries and with solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of the companies authorized by the laws mexican are not valid in the country in the star-spangled banner, the opposite way of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment rendered on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale from the bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves mexican companies without defense against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will enable the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to seize the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, then, that the justice of the cause indicates that creditors must register according to the law on the bankruptcy of the United States, the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the bankruptcy commercial formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies with a profile transnational. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the Model law of the United Nations for Uniformity of the Law of International Trade had been created to this end, taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> In the second place, the judgment establishes that, without the vote inter-company, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debt owed by subsidiaries of Vitro against the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the laws mexican recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Here there is a half-dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Bankruptcy Business had guarantees of the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> In addition, what is certain is that, as he left the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways in which the creditors of Vitro, which fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say, the fund &quot;vulture&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 votes against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A given omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another side, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, resulting costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the moment, the company of the family Gonzalez Sada interjettera appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance will claim the non-prosperity and requires the revision of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro in the framework of the bankruptcy law, business, pointing out that this was the conventions signed by the two countries for the set at the same level as the paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, it indicates that the country is folded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency, which ensure equity for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile-up of two parts: they are stunning Vitro and they are stunning the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General balance </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the ex-boss of the company, Gaston Azc√°rraga Andrade, have been passed over in silence for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the trade Union Association of Pilots Airmen has already encountered problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The instance, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez, Morineau, just submit a request for criminal prosecution against the National Banking Commission and Values, who is accused of obstruction of justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the inspecting authority has systematically denied having provides information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to remove the trust F/589 of the bank&apos;s NINTH 198 million pesos in the name of the Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds have been used for the purchase of actions of the Administration of Occupational Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As everyone knows, Azc√°rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> They laid siege to the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Gathered in the end of the week in a lecture hall of the University of the Caribbean, a group of ecologists domestic and foreign, university professors, entrepreneurs, and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad opposition front in the inauguration of the Dragon Mart chinese in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know, we are talking about a huge center of sale and distribution in Mexico, central America and the Caribbean of the products in the countries of the great wall, with an area of dwelling for employees of 150 companies. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes &quot;basketball is my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotting basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relationship with the terrain and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as big as that of Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemned to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player from the lower leagues, a player of the national team of basketball, manager, and leader of the national team, the NSO, with the Vaqueros of Bayam√≥n or as the president of the federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have worn many hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the NSO, director general of the national team and president of the Russian federation during the 90&apos;s,&quot; recalls Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home to Bayam√≥n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes am not exaggerating when he made this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all of them decorated with the photos and the memories that remind us of its route out standards, bear witness to this. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most, are those who reminds him of his stint as a player in the team of the Vaqueros in the middle of the 50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or team manager. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;This has been my best year, those of which I have benefited the most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then removed during the championship in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy is entered in the team of the NSO. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot;the Cuckoo&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has taken the helm of the team,&quot; says Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot; I have a player&apos;s tough for you, it measures two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it ?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It&apos;s like this and start Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow I was then recommended Raymond makes fun, who has been naturalized and that was one of the best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, makes fun was going to help us to try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> It is forward of the championship of the Vaqueros with makes fun, but only at a distance, as in 1988, he was already the grand manitou of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its charges and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the tournament, pre-olympic Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then, there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if this canadian judge was not made to replay the last game, &quot; said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team of the 1990 World is it the best national team that you&apos;ve seen ? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is part of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the Olympic Games in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favourite is the one of the Pan-american Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have put a beating to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze medal at the World. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, makes fun, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and &quot;Picul√≠n&quot; (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) &quot;To√±ito&quot; Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who had not been able to attend the world from 90 to cause a problem knees. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was, perhaps, not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-olympic Neuquen, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended for the imbroglio of the Pan american Games in Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What has been the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without any doubt, it is Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its level statistics of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Person in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as it was done Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in the different leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> That was the best leader puerto rican? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In the young, very much I love the work that made Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been a part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the NSO had until 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> That you are there to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only confront teams from other areas of the island at the time of the play-offs national. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people traveling and playing too much so that it is not necessarily needed. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least seen the benefit of the mandatory certifications and courses for the leaders, the field staff and the arbitrators. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> This makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I&apos;m taking advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, Fort Worth (Texas), is worldwide known by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, more known under the name of J.R., in the tv series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in which he played a business man without scruples, a terrible and manipulator. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, including the role of the oil magnate without scruple J.R. Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; has become a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a press release of the family sent to The associated Press for the Warner Bros., house of production of the &quot;Dallas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the role ironic that he loved the most,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas in this holiday of Thanksgiving. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series, and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital of Dallas, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it goes much I miss. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional individual, and he lived life to the fullest,&quot; said Gray in a press release. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The doctors had diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver to Larry Hagman in 1992 and it was found to have been drinking a lot for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumor in the liver, and had undergone a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years before, &quot;Dallas&quot;, Hagman was made known to the tv in the role of an ordinary type in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he played the role of captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought back with him. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He also played in two comedies, which remained some time on the air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among her film roles include roles well received by critics in &quot;The group&quot;, &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But this was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed its greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of CBS on the clan Ewing and their relatives has been broadcast in April 1978 to may 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who killed J.R.?&quot;, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in paris. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of the hearing at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen, and have made of the &quot;Dallas&quot; the second program of entertainment the most watched in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, who had gathered 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law J.R., Kristin (performed by Mary Crosby) who fired at him. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. was pregnant and had then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she does not leave the city, but other people had also reasons of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt man and insatiable but the charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a cheating husband who was trying to make interner his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what it would be like epitaph for J.R&quot;, said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> We should write: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here&apos;s the only part that he has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, is remembered on Friday to Hagman as a man &quot; immense, both on the small screen than in the life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know him and to love. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of the &quot;Dallas&quot; were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The registration of the five episodes is already completed for the second season, and a sixth is in progress, has informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the moment, neither the Warner nor the channel TNT did release on the manner in which will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of singer and actress Mary Martin, who had been in the celebrity with the classical works such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on scenes of theatres of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It is there that he met the young an interior decorator Swedish Shift Axelsson and that he was married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the california town of Malibu, where a resident of many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he titled his memoirs &quot;Hello Darlin&apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&apos;: The memoirs of ruthless J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I haven&apos;t written anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect in any manner whatsoever&quot;, he told the press at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active militant of the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to attend to the patients concerned. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I highly recommend them, I gave them confidence, I come up with them when they come to be operated on and after&quot;, raconte-t-il in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to offer them some comfort, such as &quot;Do not be afraid, it will not be easy for a little while, but it goes far to go&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> It has also been campaigning against the use of tobacco and has participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course dealing with the &quot;End of the world&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmed has decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing away a hook irresistible: the end of the &quot;great body count&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, referred to by many people as being the evidence of the end of the world is imminent. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But the professor Charmed had no idea what was waiting for him in the course of the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a pit tax that some have dubbed the &quot;Armageddon&quot; debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the theorists christians of the end of the time thought that would trigger the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that this was going to be the half of the more apocalyptic than I have ever known&quot;, said this week the professor Charmed its students from Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If we analyze what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days later and that we provided, this has been a very good time. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the revelation. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only teacher to give lectures on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At the Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption the course &quot;Media, culture and end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze this, because these ideas are proliferating with the time,&quot; he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guide a certain human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students will analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I&apos;ve tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, the professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a lecture, entitled simply &quot;the end of The world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add &quot;2012&quot; to have the opportunity to give the course again, in the case when the world would disappear not,&quot; said the professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In spite of the &quot;impending disaster&quot;, students have to study, create projects and pass their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student to other choice than to work &quot;until the night of the end of the world supposed to,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses have proved to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was full two hours,&quot; said Restall about its course is intended for students of high level, consisting of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received email messages for several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the share of people who were asking if there was still a place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,&quot; says Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and the sociology of 23-year-old native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the book of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a Psychology student and Infirmary of 25 years, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this matter&quot;,-he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I really appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, not told us to believe in the date of the end of the world from 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project was the mayan prophecy, and in some way we have discredited,&quot; says Julie zegle, a student of last year to the Temple, 21 years old and a native of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the book of revelation in the western culture, dating back several centuries, which fact that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places of the globe, people do not think of that,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The majority of the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of The Room that gives courses in the Philippines this year, has responded quickly when we asked him if he knew that was given here of the course on &quot;the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world&quot;, we-he answered, as if it were an exception from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a grace of the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years, we talked about many dates expected of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, &quot;the people will immediately start to think about the next date&quot; or philosophizing about the fact that on the 21st of December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers take the date to the light. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several have told us that they thought they were going to holidays &quot;to the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Sometimes I call friends and we get a good laugh together,&quot; said Samira Ford, a student in communications of 20 years. </seg>
