<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The latter is the Brennan Center for a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Republicans &quot;lawyers have in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives seen in 26 countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that the voters a photograph card and present proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, by these laws will also shorten the time frames for the early vote annulled, the right to register as voters on election day, and nationals, denied the right to vote for a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate, requires a photograph card appearances. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a demand. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 states bills, which voters are forced to draw a photograph card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card to the Health Insurance Card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed have 11% of US citizens, i.e. enfranchised 21 million people do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photograph card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, which are regarded as voters who cast their votes more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, to use their photograph card issued by its establishment. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, allow the same states members of Angel-or hunting, the more for the Republican side to choose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state for the voters demanded proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state, such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at the Hispanic votes to limit. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 in eight states laws, which promoted the registration of voters on election day was abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at to shorten the period of the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida were 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the state&apos;s voters. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate that voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in order to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were partly limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the her a photograph card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly hinder the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted and see them as influencing the results as a clear goal in the pivotal states for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of 270 votes in the Electoral College is needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies in the United States were many disturbances between the onset, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the death of patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if not carried out early detection. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men afro-American origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, has been recognized as a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that are aggressive and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient, the extent of the risk of cancer actually made clear by him the possible options, which can Prostatakrebse remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, where it has realized that no cancer treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The proposal offers them an active surveillance and them in advance of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy the criteria for determining a decide who should be dealt with and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> However, the most important thing is to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device with which it is possible, the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded from the following address: Http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention of the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise by at least 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, the spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several other cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages strong people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society promote overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem the risk of breast, Grimmdarm -, darm, esophageal, stomach speichel drüsen and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities it increased the risk of a Grimm or fattening darm cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by Räuchern, dry or salts could lead to the creation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, but are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> During a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, another rather showed an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not yet shown. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, underlines how important it is, with his doctor to talk about his concerns and his family down. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs Boson analyzed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is indeed believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the bulk of all objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And it is the last particle whose existence by the Standard Model-our best or `least wrong &quot;statement of nature and the behavior of the matter, but not yet been observed empirically predicted. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But it is not yet fully for physicists sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson strongly resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, confirmed by new data seems to be in this week in a large physics presented Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data, in order to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Nevertheless, we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, as seemingly little risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is an inevitable in this world inescapable law, which means that two objects cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to violate this rule - and try it not too much, because you will hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;Quantenzustand&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; broadly consists of some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> With this in mind, physicists share the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens who are described as Fermione and approved the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other, the Bosonen, a nasty gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are indeed can pass in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This divide Bosonen The Particle Adventure, according to the website of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The Mesonen that we are not treat and the &quot;Kraftteilchen,&quot; spread by the large forces of nature and the Higgs Boson somehow would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> But it must be stressed that this Bosonen not all are so exotic creatures, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are in a position to read these chronicle, it is thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The Photon or the &quot;Lichtteilchen,&quot; the &quot;messenger&quot; the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If the particles with a speed up electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field on this very spot, &quot;disrupted&quot; as a pebble, which has been thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Created by this &quot;disturbance&quot; an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared-or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen &quot;bearer of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be &quot;disrupted&quot; so that this Boson shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It is true that they are not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do not do so, but others - for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those that do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> What all this research can now be &quot;good,&quot; says Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all differences between the observations and predictions to look closely at the SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations as the slightest difference open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and could plug some holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there was no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, approximately 80% of the matter in the universe (ups again!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> Nevertheless, the CERN such deviations until now have not been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself the first permanent, laser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning rather was regarded as a &quot;playing&quot; laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounding the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor developed. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as a &quot;eye&quot; and has won him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;Dying in Dignity Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed in the near future, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, much remains to be done in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to look into this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer aufzehrte, it had left him a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years,&quot; he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> However, &quot;it is always a shock, which is something we cannot be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: A vast weakness prevents him to go to the toilet alone and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table with a delicious lunch, do it to help resignedly, making it difficult for them to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He manages to smile and even courageous to speak with the stranger, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bad. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest hope is that we believe diarrhea heals, because this is humiliating,&quot; he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this scourge. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;during our life, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt,&quot; Pierre told Brodeur, a psychologist in pet Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To return to the stage of childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the ability of the person,&quot; a step backwards, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events are in the midst of setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who are trained in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> They are at this stage of the doctors and nurses, who look after them, no longer with so-called &quot;curative care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, &quot;aware and to die of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But I have learned my children really know by the disease. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; it adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wishes more to life,&quot; she says, before they accepted that it sets a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> They expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In pet Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care will be used, if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to make the death pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, on top of state residents a bed for the palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little bearing in mind that one day we all will die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here will continue life under the best conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors who. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual Komforts. </seg>
<seg id="180"> We granted the dying depending on desire a mouth with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we have X served a beer, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son austrinken beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help families and patients alike,&quot; reported care director Nathalie Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the pet Victor-Gadbois is no day as the others. </seg>
<seg id="187"> As well as an old man in 93 years, the last family enjoys Rally in the courtyard and well by its head backed, while opening up in his honor, a young man dies of 36 years by his parents, his wife and two small children is surrounded, tragically, having tried everything in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;for six months, three to five beds with cancer patients in the shares is less than 45 years of age,&quot; Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted to pet Victor-Gadbois come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care. In other words, to care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as pet Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic Palliativpflege in the Greater Montreal specialize in more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This is the major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting to move on euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient with severe pain, the 14 days in the emergency room was without having has taken measures to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> While several oncologists treat their patients despite worst forecasts verbissen until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they broke off an arduous chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I abandons the fight, told them. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was at the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotente care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses that it has not granted this request, after their pain by a team of palliative care have been alleviated. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It must be made clear, however, that the palliative care in the treatment of pain is not omnipotent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After Elsie Monereau, head of the society of domestic Palliativpflege palliative care of Montreal 8% of patients are not talking to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors are so often on the terminale Sedierung, which amounts, the patients either sporadic or permanently einzuschläfern by the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to these terminale Sedierung. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain not alleviate, everyone says the same phrase: &quot;I will die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, &quot;I want you to euthanise me,&quot; but &quot;I would like to see my to alleviate pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism stipendiums Canadian health research institutions. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale housing scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of that Bauhauptgewerbes Straßenbauamtes, Geldbeschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day, what they know about a great &quot;system&quot; in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso involved. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry,&quot; the Quebec was very expensive for the taxpayer, particularly in the 1990 &quot;s and 2000&quot; s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures,&quot; witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was from him a thorough study of the embezzlement in connection with the contracts to revealed Straßenbauarbeiten in Quebec, the former Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,&quot; he said, &quot;the Department of Transport alone had saved $1 billion to the treaties,&quot; because some zügelten their instinct in order to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already resulted in two mayors,&quot; he adds, in the hope that it can show, &quot;the tactics behind the individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit launched </seg>
<seg id="221"> Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit is doing with their troops to accountants, establish the government and analysts also great efforts. </seg>

<seg id="241"> She says that the procedure is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process, the wound, but would need only for Montreal certain investigation unit, and supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to make clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>

<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players came. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff gave me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements encouraged me to improve my level of play on a daily basis. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game this is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything is very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I breche not in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my beginning at the heart of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They are so as to take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The newcomers are used to this summer Games very high levels. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that any training unit is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The result is that a player like me who must confront and wants to give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> It gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my game position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is supported by fellow coaches as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> There are currently no comparable in the Ligue 1 person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a rich experience and won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the time, I have just recovered from a series of violation. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What are your thoughts on the first part of the season of PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of top-level reiters Lyon us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the final 8 in this way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We are, however, opposed to very good European teams have our say. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want to be first in our group Porto so that we can fight the return leg of Achtelfinales as a home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can be a great European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to be a major European club, must win Paris title and make a name in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG the resources to enable this project is taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a big failure, not winning the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really close to our hearts, cream off this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We ended the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have completed with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally we should be with 79 points championship... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff on him to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4 - 0, and it still is something that we can be accused of, this is certainly something frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with 4 - 0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to draw up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In the course of time building a team. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have shown strength in the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the final 8, and also has made huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This means that our opponents and the French championship would ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG `geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better that we talk of a &quot;Zlatan dependency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is strong and many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team we respect both the players and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It also respects the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, is one of the best defenders in the world, it can also all others to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you Euro 2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was close to my heart, to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented from some game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things, from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I manage to achieve good Games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was my hope since being launched with the `Bleus&apos; . </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and now we must display an exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the `Bleus&apos; ? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coaches is strictly, the players and stimulating victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its objective by agreeing to qualify for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps the `Bleus&apos; will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> In Spain, on 16 October forced draw (1) a prelude game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has worked for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange transactions identified on the basis of central banks, and processing fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as so often in these technologies is a political vision tangible: The belief that the current monetary system of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> This is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto (one name) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network were already collected 200,000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to $2 before he has recovered to around $10 today (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly impressive compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Bitcoin describes as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;compete with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the traditional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or by the Games can buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social networking site Facebook has also developed such a system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, the trade every time controlled by a central authority and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time, repository of the Court of auditors, monetary issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network work? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose a different address for any pay, ensuring the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of related to this transaction data is electronically signed by a double Verschlüsselungssystem. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the whole network there are widespread public accounts Court Paper. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is adding the privilege to cope with these additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The &quot;taking&quot; the new computer transaction and submit their a number, before it `zerhackt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is linked to the chain of all other transactions in the long term, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, because they have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computers, the task, 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The Bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million in circulation, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room for maneuver... </seg>
<seg id="380"> In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improving computing power increases. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and Bitcoin assets stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;the problem is not the real Minutes,&quot; Pierre Noizat insured, who has just introduced Paymium that a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Cash also, however, these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia deny such donations. </seg>
<seg id="387"> By others as the WordPress blog platform will accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed by the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Paper and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins not circulating. </seg>
<seg id="389"> A &quot;Mega Schlussverkauf&quot; was launched in November. </seg>

<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin verifying the transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Furthermore, the owner managed its identity and thus can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can easily implemented, dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They simply need to give an address by a telephone &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; can be assured, Pierre Noizat, which is that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> It is a general trend, in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems designed to be reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> In its report, the ECB, which different today than well-respected risks in the event of a success to reassess its currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are withdrawn from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi leave). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States are likely to follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army takes ownership of the territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future without all of us to expect. </seg>

<seg id="406"> The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse to an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviet era. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined. </seg>

<seg id="415"> The Afghan women have the price of obscurantism of the organization Al Qaeda overpowered farmers paid to date, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>

<seg id="418"> They have turned into business leaders, have seized land by the government, so as to sell land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and benefit from the massive American subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have been discredited, and most of them were not involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> What I heard in the campaigns, the people want a government, which is composed of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, as those who take advantage of American contributions could make: Capital flight is significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>

<seg id="587"> While legislators and civil rights activist discuss what the laws on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals already with counterfeit certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only aim is to maintain a money at home remaining families to earn. </seg>
<seg id="591"> On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which each Arbeitsmigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must take. </seg>
<seg id="592"> So far, this rule applies only to migrants in the service sector, in the local housing industry and want to work in the retail sector. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, should the tests over time according to Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Language skills must both for maintaining and extending the work permit be proved. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian official language. </seg>

<seg id="599"> The whole of examination under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian people&apos;s hospitality, the Moscow State University, University of St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The migrants can take the tests in all the cities; in Russia have already been already opened centres more than 160. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative was the introduction of the tests by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde support. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Human rights activists, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What is it really? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes, the provision, language skills to deliver, both for the Russians and for guest workers? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, say the Migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labor. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers,&quot; says the head of the Federal Migrationsbehörde representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. </seg>
<seg id="606"> But their rights must be protected before departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Encounter problems migrants without working, education, language skills and medical evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably face people with bad intentions, which it under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he stay with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day will collapse. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We get many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;at home will promise you one thing, and cheated on arrival you will get their passports and do not receive the promised pay,&quot; the head of the Headquarters confirmed for migration of Tajik Migrationsbehörde, Tolib Schwaripow. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Not whose chief. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, many people give the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the destination country, but also in their own language hardly able to express in writing. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not their fault, so much as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Because there are not even in their families money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and Schulsachen. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As a teenager these children to take the first opportunity to earn money. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;It is difficult without language skills,&quot; they are. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;you fühlst humiliated and degraded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Human rights activists stress on the law following important aspect. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The test must only migrants with legal status. </seg>

<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;welcome&quot; or &quot;Entry prohibited for unauthorised persons &apos; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many migrants in Russia, confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fake and we are not registered, and then result cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,&quot;, the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;spare no expense for false papers &apos; </seg>
<seg id="631"> Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Some counterfeit certificates, which are educated the language tests certify, have already been of members of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The fraudulent papers were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners this is true: Every migrant, hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree. </seg>
<seg id="637"> For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, only promise that they receive time for a language rate. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, newcomers without language skills, offered jobs in areas where there is no active necessary understanding with people. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US fast-food and supermarket workers on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American young people sitting behind the coffers of Mc Donald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days there has been across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s and Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow or whether they will soon be back to the air. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning non-governmental organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to improving the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, are aimed at low and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sold all products, ranging from nappies of hunting rifles and car batteries to dust saugern, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore buy many of the slightly paid Walmart work only on their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Prices and the range of goods, Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Critics say the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply because the staff are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about hard work conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; protests demanding wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance has risen from 30% to $100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart workers who earns $9.5 per hour, cannot afford this increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart. </seg>
<seg id="741"> The equivalent of 1.1% more than they now pay for donations. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart would pass on the full wage increases to their customers, each purchase only 46 cents more in the future. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Per year would be the for them compared with the current expenditure of only 12 39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests and that the company gave no losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold in this period some 5,000 Article per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Walmart cash on &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing Huffington Post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart workers working niederlegten and the protest action only &quot;another PR stunt&quot; was the union that organised the protests,. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;free money!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which in this progressive city unwanted and therefore are not so far), but McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants were. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says the company sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8 $90 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As it is possible to live in New York with so little money is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s was behind the Theke, but young people were living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald&apos;s constantly people who complain that they live with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children if it did not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald&apos;s in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law does not permit this objective to stand in the way of corporate governance and trade unionists abzumahnen or released. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, they cannot simply corporate governance. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> Vocal protests on this day, there were many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The height of the protests was an assembly at midday before the McDonald&apos;s on Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we should support the fast-food staff together so that they paid a fair and economic prosperity can achieve that every New York deserves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest project of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people on the ground, were far from all of them in the fast-food industry employed in the tens of thousands of work in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately outsmart&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The purveyors of the enlarged becomes a reality in supporters of modern technologies recently usually seen through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then known that Microsoft had a similar patents. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the lens for the company&apos;s scientists was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It fascinates the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and to create virtual belts. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please Beschreiben briefly, what research group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, humanity is largely stuck in the stage, where the Pixeln on Flachbildschirmen, which sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want 5-10 years vorausblicken and the radical changes this interaction foresee. </seg>
<seg id="782"> , for example, the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect sensors a step forward, and today will no longer without Xbox Kinect sold, as all interested in movement control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What are still expected in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, has a great deal to the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that are working on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> Yet it is necessary that not only the users, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could supplement the real world much easier with virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And first of all, we should be rid of this bescheuerten virtual reality helmets. </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about language management? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it will not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always would like to inform all others on his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Any kind of interaction with computers is really good, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places in a project in which we experimenting with short and narrow, rather than sprawling gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not from the object camera, recorded, but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bone and muscle. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively large, but could in theory to the size of a wristwatch be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But the future belongs to all types of mixed governance, for example, Gestik and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - As the? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - We would you ask me, for example, you this Sprudel dose to extend? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - O, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - saying that you want the user will adapt to the, which can make a machine at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the next time we especially need to work on the development of new types of sensor, which will make it possible to collect responses from people. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good dissolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of dissolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, 8 Megapixel at a speed of 1000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In this respect, all current technologies not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only the break-up along the X and Y-but also take into account along the Z axis. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also the speed and the number of images per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of people are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with a regulierbaren processing delay between 1 and 100 Millisekunden, with today&apos;s commercial carriers closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much influenced the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> Just as an instrument for my work I needed, only without contact management and with more images per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - should not be increased the number of cameras first? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect is currently working with three &quot;cameras,&quot; with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not intended to calculate the object deep. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras may solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or, as more calculations needed to strengthen the problem. </seg>
<seg id="826"> Would be nice a flexible, Kinect-similar system in which we could play with various camera slopes, in order to determine how we help the three-dimensional investigation a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft his glasses not public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged everyday reality in the lens has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course it is not nice, always a Smartphone en route to keep in the hand, but I think the following: The tollste variant would be a &quot;rotating&quot; enlarged reality in which we have a cloud of the lens could tune in to the Smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal Gadget and that is its strength (private you can only see), but also its weakness, as it is an enlarged reality through the lens prevents you can work together with other virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let us for a moment that the virtual Hologramme manipulation in the air not only Tony Stark is accessible from Iron Man, but also human beings. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem, to underline the Critics frequently this idea: There is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> The answers to your group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of taktilen perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure excellent true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at the &quot;images in the air a hand&quot; to give firm, for example, the collision of ultrasound directed some rays in a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still so weak, as pustete ballen someone on hand. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the hand Accident, affecting the nervous endungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> I think that it should feel what it felt when it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, as we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a man who is physically in a closed area, to believe that he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we have been working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms and large bullets. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far the brain can only moderate fall, and we still have many years of hard work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> It is precisely that which makes work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers appeal: On many issues we are only at the start. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Their own taste rather than cultural rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt continues the &quot;Petersburg vanguard&quot; project, the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the select list, already high-ranking Petersburg art scene, whose achievements and often go beyond the city&apos;s borders, without recognition in Europe to be known in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the &quot;artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red in a Russian museum, sometimes at the summer, sometimes in scene-meeting or Vernissagen. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Petersburg vanguard in the late 80s and early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also a man of the city and confirmed by his presence on the streets smiles in the face and his fellow citizens is causing them for good humor. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently, at a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgel players, as it is for these difficult role in terms of artists dasein, his philosophy and his image was adrift. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why you are always in red and not, for example, in yellow or Türkis in the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society calls on everything, something from the gray standard, aggression and bad behavior. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But let me by my provocations to meet with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> All my last provocation was an invitation to talks. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When wusstest you that you must be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, and my work were issued. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that I must go this way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> That was the period of old free, but not officially recognized painter to end, and then new and free painters as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I friendly with the new generation of painters, with representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; hence, &quot;Puschkinskaja 10,&quot; and then was first conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Me prefers the theater, fashion, music, everything except in literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all the united in your kind-hospital... - It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical, artistic club to the renovation of the Boheme, the House of Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> String and his friends sang simple songs to play-back close jersey and contributed to them was the today mature composer Igor Wdowin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> As the group began to play live, it was &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Costumes mountain facilitated many programs before the time of `Halli Galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them costumes mountain, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Also the gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club `Griboedov &quot;have their origin in the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our staff and stem passengers. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, there have been in the press, a survey on the award &quot;figures of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artist of the Year Award, and I was at the height. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You may be famous, without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your work has a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many my images are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and ferocity of the idea. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am an exhibition with the theme of &quot;The Russian museum as clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear that to be the case. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blur all this and loses its tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by making that everyone has to dress up fully. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now respects everyone on the clothes and the Outer and not focused on the inside of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but he should face spucken. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The illusion disappear by the dress up. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgel player. - A City of Culture should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Can be commercial art nice? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - It must be careful, respectful and complimentary commercial art. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Earlier formed the human large groups: The Bohemiens loved one and the other the ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not 100 dollar note that everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Will you consider who have now fallen. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult star around 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - At him, abandoned women, there is a role for the sexually-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> 300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and anything goes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has already been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have such pictures painted in a gathering with the works of Falk and even in a series Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I began with images, which normally only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It reads: Intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption does not have a culture that is quite another. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture, which I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - the best culture experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Saying that servant of culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the real czar the tsars may not be understood it was different, because a lot of culture, but it is understood that right experts necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good adviser. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but the road has been closed, as it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former properly evaluate and open the path for them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now only their own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for you Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is far more culture and breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones art find it difficult to grow up. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural fertile ground for example we now have more writers and readers, and this is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, these are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded through grants the city of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in outer space </seg>
<seg id="933"> World at risk. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or clash with killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Karawanen of space ships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a replacement planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity, the important issue is how we in the bubbles or spare planet can breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are many choices I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="938"> De facto, there are only two real planet that we could at least hypothetical inhabit. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Mars and Venus,&quot; says the scientific staff of the astronomical star mountain Institute Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich, there is a Venus on the surface temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would be only in height or Venus in orbit, in space, possible. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space in terms of the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plant. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of peas, not at all was produced in the orbit of the irdischen species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies in detail (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 Wachteleier were sent out into space, we want to see how the bubbles on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It develops a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem starts. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicks must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without firm underground überschlugen the chicks wild. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the babies. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks not responded to light and Laute. </seg>
<seg id="953"> They then simply died four days later. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;twice we chicks and slip it, simply because it is impossible to work with them,&quot; there is Vladimir Sychew for a failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But will be based on the Biosatelliten &quot;Bion&quot; only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats that are already fertilized were sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle it was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;That was just with the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only one experiment, and research needs to be continued,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing the space rats were young. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The problem of reproduction directly in space could have not been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, snatched from their natural habitats, simply cannot follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals could man the in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is capable of abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Such experiments on ethical considerations are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women already fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk, Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Möwe flew and nobody in the world can answer the following question: Would it preserves the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> Will they can bring a child into the world after this flight? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;after all, nobody answered this question,&quot; says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only one year after its space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 brought forth the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit and even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, it remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonaut where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,&quot; concludes Kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet must humanity for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the produce artificial Gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The cosmonaut&apos;s Hydrolabor in preparation center is a compulsory station during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water is the bubbles. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is an alien environment, but infants feel water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small Ichtyander testify of that life in the country rose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child, approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit is water, and that it can easily become accustomed to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, the logical, as the cradle for the first swimming just 2 weeks pass. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget,&quot; says something Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> So while the bubbles for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of bubbles, the stomach and basin muskulatur is very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the baby. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer in order to extract the baby. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens?&quot; is the important issue of Valery Poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the Erdanziehung to feel the skeleton and muscles, the organism cannot train. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child cannot as an adult in the orbit to training in a burden to be invested. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply the lack, which is vital for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;this experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world,&quot; says the head of the Institute for medical and biological Bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in outer space just theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, but they reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ C hef: Control of the black system failed as a result of the policy </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic holds good bodies in connection with public contracts and adequate laws, however, is back in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In talks for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us,&quot; commented on Kala the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Come to a similar conclusion seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As a negative practice for it leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas the so-called &quot;black system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is now prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work,&quot; Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was there in concrete terms? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel examination, with which we began about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is a question that the European legislators are to decide how to handle public contracts. Count on the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this we have compared with each other, and although the review has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences. Generally speaking, laws are perhaps a little &quot;strict and perfect,&quot; but the real application is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also address the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? What is for you from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a common control could help that we stop at a constantly perfecting of laws and cutting and balancing of thresholds, if this obviously not very positive effects. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that we in this way the system only with excessive &quot;red tape&quot; and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> They are talking about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system work in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the General Accounting Office, NKÚ built along the same lines as at home and also has a college that only slightly different. But both authorities are similar in principle. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, that is, that the courts in the individual Länder - and this is where the German system differs from our. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH may only federal funding control what our public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which is administered by the districts and communities, with us. There are subject to the control of the Courts </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the German legislation, which is easier than our? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would generally without specifics are reluctant to compare. Nevertheless, Germany in some ways, often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is perhaps because the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Surely not, but as I have said, I may not particularly like to such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> This is still, it should be noted that even a model for those countries which are also struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> What the Czech legislation, had for the revision of the law on procurement, you feel your authority have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is in our tests have not yet. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our controls after, we must take place here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Impact we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and introduced with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analyzed, the changes will change of course, because the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You see the passage of this bill rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> However, there is the difficulty that the rules are &quot;strict&quot; and cannot be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any breach of public procurement law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> It makes sense to make the law even stricter? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system have to exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system and not penalize those who have made a formal errors, which affects the real decision-making not. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the solution? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say first of all, what is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers with controls of the so-called &quot;black&quot; system would lay-exactly what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The black and system is now prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: `We change the law and allow the matter, &quot;but he cannot say that we are, as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The allocation law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is right for the protection of public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone because of procedural irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets, occasionally Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic consists partly snow and Eisglätte. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think that is due to take place in less than a month of doom? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those disasters reports, we the people so much like to start up again. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The TAP TAP let us more poked fun at and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to halt the doomsday or prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December realize you also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine our readers the project? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung plan that we have two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> To this end, we want to use the Marketingpotenzial of the Mayan calendar, the end is forecast at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 a.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of the Maya calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Where this idea come from? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally come from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In this connection, we would not enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, together with the public, but we also want to consider in the state we give our children the world. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique range of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key supporters against the doomsday developed, with their purchase on www.e - tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The TAP TAP, together with other performers also known as the anthem against the doomsday entitled &quot;doomsday is included.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will ring out on the Benefizkonzerten? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the end, provided that all work and not the doomsday... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns together in a Direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, which also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How can you come to the cooperation with both? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech culture scene, that implies that we achieve many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to these people involved in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It was clear that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun in it. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose will be of great benefit to the proceeds of concerts against the doomsday? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier free education center Studeo, on which we are already six years working together with the club TAP in Jedlička Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them in various leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Since the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute to create a separate buildings in which we then with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In every concert, several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria you have chosen this? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, Chinaski Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You know everything else on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar &quot;events&quot; are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> We are in May for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert with interesting guests we are preparing a interesting program. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also like to arise in the Czech house in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their foreign plans are not just small, you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> However, the TAP TAP is a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with this travel logistical and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments koffer and other baggage mitschleppen... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes even surprised me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility as they deal with disabled people, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we are witnessing the in Russia that were in the east is still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair is traveling alone in the city center. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not even, of course, that there is a person in a wheelchair lift vorlässt, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there will also be created clubs who are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things, where we are... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> To say that there is an improvement in the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities too independently in the public sphere, go into the museum, can use toilets, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not normal for a larger group of disabled people, and we are actively involved in social life with the band The TAP TAP slightly ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, things will start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The TAP TAP is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What did you in 1998, motivated to start a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I began as carers in Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something hard. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am musicians including. Saxofon games, I have established a music company, along with a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Na, and, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known but only in recent years, or I am wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known Sängern helped us; we have also started to campaign actively for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We realized that if something, and this is not outwardly, their own performance in a sense does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the EU aid we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment, etc... </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It is your goal, but with The TAP TAP so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the outset, I felt the potential that can things in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In Showbusiness today often copied the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In its own way, it is only logical as anything new viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the spectators usually has, of course, compassion; it is only natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities do something, this is not just a step forward for themselves, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was also helpful for this success that you are a strong leader, as you can tell by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, you cannot compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some come with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have test twice a week, must overcome stages of preparation and spend a lot of time travel on concert, then the enthusiasm among many quickly extinguished. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But the way things work everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At present, The TAP TAP twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the outset, since 1998. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. People come and go. You cannot prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and the desire to do, we always welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former communist bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA Member). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path Poland into space but began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, but they do not always were met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, where the author ideas from his pioneering &quot;entrance to Kosmonautik&quot; presented. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (conduct. However, 1905), the audience cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won in the year in 1934 for &quot;receipt to Kosmonautik&apos; the donated by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis internationally recognized contribution to the development of space, inter alia, acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon has been named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> As early as the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket powered was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the missile for Starten or brakes the Draisine should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information derived only from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with raketenbetriebenen munitions. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the documents provided that research has got to the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German military power. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the press of mine. Draft originating Rohoziński fotoelektrischen hunting rocket, and the following year, the work &quot;Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of missiles antriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war were all projects for military use of missile technology by the artist scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of hard work, however, the war began his work was closed. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four dedicated extensive article of the space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to join the International Federation for space, founded in 1951 and the PTA was actually due as early as the autumn 1956 member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This office he had until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres long and weighed approximately 80 cm was not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM, 1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów desert air tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM - 2 </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another level of development should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM - 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the monitoring of high winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, was the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Heir to the first rockets of the type RM was the 1962 to 1965 developed over the years Meteor 1 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> By this missile were developed three types (Meteor 1A, 1B - and 1 C) that in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor - 1A missile had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor - 1B more than 34 litre and Meteor 1C on 0.62 litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude for all three types 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968 was in the aviation institute the Meteor 2 missile, developed the first test flights began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor - 2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able, specifically a of 10 kg in a level of approximately 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then the versions were built meteor - 2H and Meteor - 3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Is also noteworthy Poland&apos;s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland also participated in the framework of the Interkosmos program with Soviet satellite in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the last week, the Constitutional Court on voluntary work on the law. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision, a lively debate in public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting, to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is a state is trying to understand where the manufacturers to compete with imports cheaper goods in the economic, making the competition &quot;unterbietet,&quot; thereby grab a larger share of the market and to increase its profit. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale does this mean for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or to abandon their business. The result is a comparable high unemployment in countries with high labor costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As the capital no social responsibility and, therefore, bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily increase public spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is made even worse by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and by the overall economic and social damage caused by them to replace. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are not at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to reduce the social artificially level of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words: Governments provide its own people without regard to the social consequences from the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in amendments to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Objective of these measures is to force its own people, particularly in the field of pay to accept the dictates of private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly by financial constraints in long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by limiting the workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is growing poverty, and widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who are no longer able to feed through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people are already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all EU southern will undoubtedly come to exactly the same situation, in which the people under pressure from a disastrous crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society and hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The natural question that arises here is where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, is only the poverty from one country to another, or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This is all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state cannot capital involved in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state cannot intervene lenkend in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But we must ask whether the capital&apos;s policy and thus affect the entire state in their own selfish sense or even. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> This is a clear answer: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all countries. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the fight against corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation, in the criminal virtually everything, but nothing is punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the reality is that a State Department due to lack of finances private, with the industry verflochtene legal companies charged with drawing up draft law. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All violence will no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions, but powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously liberal democracies are currently quickly in a situation like they Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic Caesar and Pompeius `describes: &quot;The government was that has long been the disintegration and the offices have been filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes by unlawful or fraudulent use of benefits with Stein and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people have already bought votes on election, people with &quot;...&quot; character bewarben not for offices, so that the state had &quot;no consul for eight months due to this decline...&quot; You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine is a dictatorship in this difficult situation, and that a strong man should be chosen &quot;... Appian is thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, which democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is based in today&apos;s society, as in antiquity the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who do not in any way seek deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism we must therefore in the reckless economic liberalisation systems in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Seen from the current condition, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, already in the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we are already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and contemporary history, in complete ignorance of. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore systembedingt. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital increase the state involvement in the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> ... &quot;nothing from violence, or ever could arise&quot; sings Sting in song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons wanted no wars, there would be no,&quot; says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel as terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is victims; eventually, today&apos;s residents of Israel including the self-rule areas were born into the current political situation and have not even seen the beginning of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> What is important is to open the readers to look behind the scenes, the mind, whom the 95 years tension (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spots are conducive to country in the Middle East in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or which group of people significant impact on the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era we can represent a Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these figures, the autonomous certain in their actions, or whether someone stand behind their throne, their actions drew on a vorbestimmtes target. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power not within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomical is a particularly rich families, which could be described as head of the zone (I do not know whether anyone else is above them, I do not exclude this but) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written on them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was already in the 1990s by the Rothschilds bought in the 19th century, in order to prevent the link its name with hochkriminellen deeds, in whose background is to consolidate their power, to increase their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wars or equip itself in this (before the attack on Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government suggested). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused, the status of Rothschilds Bank of America to renew the central bank began during the civil war to produce its own (read: State) notes and was assassinated in a theater 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to produce its own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden he was poisoned in 1936 after the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 wanted to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The Rothschilds led the global appetite in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three World Wars by Albert Pik, a Freemasons of the 33rd and highest degree of insight. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was aimed to eliminate the large monarchistischen countries of Europe by the second war in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world&apos;s population on about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would for their comforts and reduce their consumption of luxury and would also not so many resources), create a Universalreligion (The Ökumenismus is nothing more than the run-up to) and finally lead to the absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds is working at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order Chao order from the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed to prevent crises like the not repeat them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar empire was the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European imperial Austria, Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to be able to make easier the Second World War, the bankers by the policies they create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparationen showed; they created the condition impoverished masses, so that they only a sufficiently strong driving the Germans had to unterjubeln named the culprits and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the Vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should play the role of a fifth column and also took to the war brand. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the nineteenth century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement of a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first established clashes with the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain losriss, in which the international bankers initially believed, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war reparationen against Germany prepares the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel was the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, like the Jewish people during World War II victim in the front line, this time with the Arab or Muslim people of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly people in Israel&apos;s supporters and opponents). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the culprit, who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong only wrong in an endless spiral of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> We must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only its own candidate for election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal ergebenen politician, who is doing everything possible to ensure to start a war with Iran, which in view of Iran&apos;s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for Cooperation (...), China, India, Russia, Pakistan could rapidly degenerate into a global conflict and where it because of Iran&apos;s control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, to destroy the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the light as the words David Rockefellers in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In a world of their idea is the new world order masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of finance aristokraten. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn deaths in childbirth is a chip implanted this nature of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;and it is that the big and the small, the rich and the poor, the Free and the Knechte all a Malzeichen say their right hand or to face that nobody can buy or sell, he had because the Malzeichen, namely the animal&apos;s name or the number of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, anyone who has sense of wonder the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1337"> For their release, demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution which for decades the Patronat on his regime had maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US government, there have been no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to throw away, the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent the hostage fiasco in violent attempt exemption only made matters worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government had been. </seg>

<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the message, six staff the flight. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> This ended after numerous complications in the Canadian ambassador&apos;s residence. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them a &quot;story to Verdeckung their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Drehorte stabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction film visited. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of Genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The experts for &quot;Exfiltration,&quot; Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So that the cover was credible, article on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a special combination of different film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called &quot;Caper Movie,&quot; i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the film levels of the atmosphere - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the title sequence ikonische contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there is no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easy überspitzt therefore. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, men in suits at the meeting table, the official fluren, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable relaunch his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a belächelten actor has become a respected director, as well as actors, he is no longer the objective ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No children&apos;s (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is not in the Afflecks first film, the native of Boston director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place was being one of the characteristics that the previous films this contrasted with the standard Hollywood director. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran played by Canada `.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of storming the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and gives, the sense of Verwirrtheit and unpredictability, once that happens, if somewhere history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong movie stab at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much in too many places to act </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with that history is actually not many in the cinematographic sense offers exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He has worked with the few but it quite successful, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft, which then not always seems so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America is avoided, or persecution hunt on the runway, something curious). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is due to the need, too much in too many places to act to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood staff are very charming, but more room deserve their characters in the film, and they are far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film loses a little traction as a result. It is a film you with some interest and the design and the Retro reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years-style can approve. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Enthusiasm, it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a living piece of history and to date in certain ways as proof of how excessive but notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Directives for inflating balloons, bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the oddest bank charges, has decided that the competition this year `absurdeste regulation or idea from the EU to hold workshop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;on this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher, for dealing with the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities such is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> In the meantime women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are strictly a lower risk for the insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;further incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> On the controversial EU regulations, including the binding to mixing bioethanol fuel in its wake naturschädigend is, the more the banning of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount this hazardous material, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, this year because of the eggs were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism 81st in the past, the ban on the use of the term &quot;butter spreads&quot; or even ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas must be 14 cm long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels usually are represented by one or more Member States (for example, currently the Czech Republic is trying, with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also behind that banana the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must show a &quot;Krümmungsanomalie&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission argued with the argument that they only the mixed national standards harmonisiere, handicapping the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU in the face of opposition from some countries were already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to a loss of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year in accordance with balloons to sales by pointing out that children under the age of eight air balloon must not without adult supervision of a aufblasen. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU citing an American study in accordance with balloons are the leading cause suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction is already using Jahrmarktströten for children up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious incursions at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials themselves-anyone who has an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece cannot use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned. Absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies to the day of our EU accession located on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic crossed then canned mushroom set volume, for which we have a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or the idea of funding for applications for grants. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are put at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will refund apply to the EU, &quot;said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument is that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called. Be intervention purchases were overcrowded. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> As the Czech Republic, the EU should have a path to seaports according Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros to us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations are somewhat in the Member States a target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts for regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to these experts tend to be the EU funding for projects absolutely have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual Member States. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific names traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic has been following a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&apos; defend Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century with us, but our manufacturers in&quot; Tuzemák &quot;had to rename. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name rum can only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of products are registered in the EU in the society of the world-famous cheeses feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> With a EU brand, because the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hořicer roles pride. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> &quot;I want the Republic rette, but I am just an amateur,&quot; Okamura said. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, as is the idea to stand for the presidency? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not my intention, Senator or to be president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything would work without problems in our country, I would stand nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer with the Republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while the people&apos;s taxes and increasing the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions, politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I am more than 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no option but to influence things to run for senator or the president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have managed and then go straight to the road in the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Are turning their backs on you will not your constituents? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that I the fight to Burg them after the outcome of the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I have this clarified and said that I will be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my aim is not the function. The role is an instrument, with whom I can carry out my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> I do not need as much influence and a possible this strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television rant knock, but everyone who wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Then there are the media want to deprive the honor, and the confuse the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me, for example, claimed that I would journalists bribe or that I was Jiří Paroubek consultants. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The fight for the Burg you have with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective assets of more than 20 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole may bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As ordinary citizens, I have argued that the tour guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded policy, if someone from the right or left with a good proposal is rejected this deliberately, and the population is only. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent parteiloser I have a much greater potential to win support from all the political parties represented in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> See you as a person in politics rather right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am inclined to see people left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this is right-left political thinking but completely irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> I think it is important that we make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, and I would like to human beings. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or of the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It is you, if someone called populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you can&apos;t confirm this, what you have just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you in a company set up a business plan, then you will have an ideal destination and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you want to this approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they were discussed by important experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> Without support in Parliament, however, you just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And so that you cannot do too much in politics in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that if you just long enough, you talk to the people, for example, will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side to achieve these aims. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the Angesprochenen if necessary, to say why they oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which refers to abuses, can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Let you take the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the politics, I just starting and try to find the support of the majority, for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess things for themselves; and if it fails, then I am going to six years back to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that my own nothing can; therefore, I spoke with several famous people about whether it does not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have for example, Radim Jančura spoken, but rejected for work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová detected the fraud in trade with easy fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy I began with the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the electorate are not at all to the elections, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are in only two independents in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have such an elected Senate composition that changes it will be very difficult to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example for the election of mayors and district of men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Think about the establishment of a separate party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past each potential party member, and certainly do not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> They have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> They talk of asset declarations, what would your? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I appreciate my personal fortunes around 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a piece of land, with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth around one million. And then I have a couple of million in the bank. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a child&apos;s dream-James Bond did I have always been, as he was driving galant on women in the car while fighting against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> They drive an Aston Martin, have a net worth of $60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not exactly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I have to make debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I had no sponsors, shows that my program is not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to deny that the campaign out of its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live by Senator close budget alone; I could, for example, my son not the English school finance, which costs 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So you are still active as entrepreneurs, in order to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you did not these activities will be cut? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that is not linked to the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have my activities partly reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Thus, for example, my deputy director in the spring of travel agents. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want to see me as a Samaritan saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I have also of something live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Around 200,000 to 400,000, and continue to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I think businesses would stop. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You can find the full discussion in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV prove that the real adventure are not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think the building, it is futuristisch, and finally there is something interesting to see,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby Großbetrieb, says: &quot;But, it is beautiful, the House.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and E Books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is still voluntarily in one of these old-Style-libraries, or? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little town at the gates Rotterdams besichtigungsbedürftige sleep is sonderbarer record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80,000 inhabitants-community, the lowest rate in the Netherlands on education. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to counter this stupid fact, it was decided a few years ago, contribute to education and the seven imaginary bridges, the seem to the euro, as nicely bepinselte steel beton miniaturen depicted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the education with some limited offensive. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics should Mr: A library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas by the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of Tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, often cynical buildings, the matter with his usual composure and appeared to competition in 2003 with five books hearing the rich and a grin on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still intrigued eyes and with the Achseln zuckte, stapelte the impudent Maas its fine Mitbringsel according to the size of a pyramid and ended his speech has underpinned aktionistisch with the words: &quot;Dear city community!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euro expensive mountain aufgeschüttet. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, including underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books with the second &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&apos; excellent. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> So that is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte that to date no longer had to offer as a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white façades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, just a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to books </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Books eldorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift, the middle around the massif, but the real space and reading freuden unlock the fußläufigen climbing the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The totally gun-shy Klinker verglaste indoor is bright and clear, on the bed and the elegant street lights are clearly the language of a public city. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking for parking Bank, dog and football boys and Mädels&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;usually, the books shelves along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark area, which is usually uncomfortably and impersonal way,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic area konfiguration upside down and the reading area from inside out gestülpt. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental technology center and House central. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular pleasure is the black books shelves, which can Wandverkleidung, Brüstung or Stiegengeländer. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Pulp and Haptik and smell are removed. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers at the unknown Baustoffs shake their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycling materials here,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city community Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen Agrarbetrieb one day on a suitable waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies a source document. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> This is cheap and zeiteffizient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The slender textiles one or two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library was the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimeters thick plates pressed. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the so-called Landbouwplastic (exposure to heat and pressure verfärbt KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl after new cars and a bissl reeks of sports footwear. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 stages, reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 metres long travels at Literaturcafé, will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and eingetopften Ficusbäumen rewarded. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature gebirge. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe it is, but this is a flagship project despite the many glass land in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Heated and will be kept cool with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books under a glass of fall, the sun is shining even on sunny days just interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The binder wood glue, the right to the outside glass, serve as Beschattung and begin a large part of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The room climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest fully automated Rollos. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics in the IT industry, dared the way in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Also Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even Spijkenisses &quot;long overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: Every residents to open a few weeks ago was invited to donate a book from his personal stock. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> It should start by the optical gaps in the not yet fully bestückten library currently 70 of them-be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is good enough. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled by obenhin. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;German must play greater role &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has been in the abstained from voting on the opening of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US European relations,&apos;re Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> German wave: Germany had indicated earlier this week that it violates the request for observer status for the Palestinians were to vote at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then abstained from Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo, Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany abstained also, when it came to enforce a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was finally enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany find it hard to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it&apos;s true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that was swept away by the US gemanaged, towards a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are also among the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It expects them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still remember their role, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, like France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Which means a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy as it from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN had? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, there must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not offending. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This will play a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not to attach too much importance to the, this is not a completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by chose to abstain on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Consequently, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international players and its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, on the other hand, have a clear message for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are some differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These differences have always exists because of American domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But due to the political situation here, the government this position publicly, of course, cannot represented. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat of Netanyahu&apos;s policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult for Germany to its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU&apos;s position on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is precisely what they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, in view of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans are well aware that they have a more independent role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany itself is in its role as a major global players-Germany wants to play a major role in the first place? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the lead Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not accustomed to this is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany will adopt a greater role, a variety of German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It is not just the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is the old problem: You would not be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the US influence in European politics continuously, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, making them even more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>

<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-renowned brand Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> There is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> But she enjoys protection as long as the real name of employers not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear whether will get justice. </seg>

<seg id="1640"> So just Lu, Gucci, Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny register. </seg>

<seg id="1645"> In the big cities there are mehrstöckige department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Stalemate hole cases but on behalf of his clients are different: He does to deal with the fact that Chinese companies from the trademarks agency officially given the right to use a name, which is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; a passenger mark. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> These women are that the rich men angling. </seg>

<seg id="1651"> &quot;That is deprive, it must be fought,&quot; calls for stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is watered down the Alleinstellung disappears, the image damage is huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the Prozesskosten the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year&apos;s third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But erased dubious entries in brands register are difficult to achieve and go into the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years can drag on the procedure, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>

<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff misfortune, he must have the Plagiator even pay money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also affect graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German pump concrete planter Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyers Geely, originally a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous Crocodile look in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing to that there is 2010 for lack of staff and space equipment shortages. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, the &quot;emergency but normality in the business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> It is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has declined by 22%. </seg>

<seg id="1670"> But in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections to carry out. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Address it costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It is a record and means that the list of China on the tenth consecutive Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The line of reasoning would also apply to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 are 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Simplified, this means that any notification on average 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Address it costs much joy, as the case of the German family business mountain shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Although the Germans achieve that was lifted the illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the counterfeiters secured to the Chinese brand rights joy. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We missed the family name, as in Germany could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>

<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies, joy mountain may be right, but the Prozessgegner fighting until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We have to höllisch careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The matter is now before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says, &quot;the procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs would be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even one hundred years old files they need in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, offered joys of opposition in vain a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; to resolve. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;this shows you how much it is worth,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East are even after Europe zurückzuschwappen. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, if there Imitatoren vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name pleasures mountain on shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This area of business, the company has already abandoned, but he could avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You höllisch must be careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies to be very careful when dealing with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should &quot;everything somehow register is worth protecting, including in China,&quot; as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if joy mountain last act of his trademark dramas too, then it is the other side should pay royalties on their own behalf, said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will segment in question squeezed out of the market. </seg>

<seg id="1710"> Of the 50 Sängerinnen and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the householder. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;om Obani&quot; is not an easy step, every chorus agree with another text and do this in a very foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> There are around 34 million people infected with HIV in the world, the UNAIDS estimates that the United Nations program to fight against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million people live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Living in Swaziland 245000 children orphaned by AIDS. </seg>

<seg id="1717"> For the club has 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them are secondary school. </seg>

<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the child, Schuluniform tuition and a warm meal every day in the Gogo-Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means on Zulu stories erzähler or Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Fluent in the Bantusprache can sing, but no one in this area. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this foreign soft language and also brings them and to get back where they originally came from, in the southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the German Chores Stimmgewalt. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of whom are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have lost their parents, because they are HIV resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, what in Swaziland is: High HIV infection rate lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Restrictions on freedom of male Vorhaut, the proven to reduce by half the risk of contagion, by the people won&apos;t be adopted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency virus, with center 30 to die is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children in the streets, which are not only lacked parental care, but simply of everything: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without school in a poor country was certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later founded the chorus &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; the club, which has since then almost professional care about the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts on sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI, Humane Pappilomaviren are HIV, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the most vulnerable groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper come mainly among men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany-reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren often occurring sexually-transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is comparatively small, however, about 20% of HIV infections account for this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people are chlamydia infections far more frequent than in other sections of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys affect three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here are often also Humane Pappilomaviren among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 in 2001 to 3698 disease more than doubled in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of HIV infections since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> There were around 2 700 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, urinate, complaints to the flow, Unterbauchschmerzen and Bläschen or Warzen. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can we protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Because partly agent sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Diagnosed early and repercussions cured most STI can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> By godmothers, donations and, last but not least, the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, some come together. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman who money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> They are also considering that the orphans well accommodated in one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, as we call the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have included up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms schooling appear on time every day. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Anyone who has no one else comes into obstruction of protection Khanyisile, a single woman who will be paid by the club in the same way as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has also launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and in conjunction with the American Health Organisation PSI organised a HIV test that many in the village have let. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease throughout the country is so obvious that they are ideally dead silence. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Really strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned life that the HIV has spread so quickly in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms exist in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, &quot;but they are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is another-flesh to flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote cultural exchange something, the Imbongi-chorus every two or three years jointly by the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern light on the black continent even in times of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip continues even after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even though the small village on maps little, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than aware. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;after Esitjeni, there is the light&quot; say the people there. </seg>

<seg id="1891"> The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not yet arrived here in the province. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was in May with the Eurovision Song Festival famous, and next year we have here a festival of the world&apos;s oldest people,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is the director of the museum of longevity, the only in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the vita of around eight dozen Talyschen documented in the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva shows a black and white oto. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of a child born 136 years ago </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, should have become the 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is not a birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but highly dubious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot; 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973,&quot; explained Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children, aged between 136 years he should have a daughter born. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has Şirali Müslümov also in his age by a few decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the Hochbetagten in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;striking number hochaltrige people, there is also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also live in Sardinia lots of very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> But due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, because people were register. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, ashtray geschmolzene butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach a biblisches age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people who are more than 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why live here in the south so many hochbetagte? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the food is. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But it is the calories of Talyschen as healthy diet should be above all dairy products, meat, bread and love, many of whom drink a glass of geschmolzene butter on a daily basis, from a nutritional point of view is not just plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original lifestyle that young people? In Lerik Cengemiran, a tiny settlement from the city, sits Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years it is still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants live in a simple wood, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region. </seg>

<seg id="1926"> All my life I have not once bought in a supermarket food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then they told by her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father Heydar&quot; Aliyew took the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, which is being driven by the nation&apos;s father figure, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, later took his son Ilham the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no need in Azerbaijan elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for a sum here, which we can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right: &quot;the elderly enjoy respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive </seg>

<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft says, the jurisdiction grounds on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is meant by &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will use. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> That suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter Article: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al Ashar University zurate, the country&apos;s main Islamic institution with great clout throughout the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It does not have, but it may mean that the clergy overseeing the legislation, which would lead to de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to remain. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts served during Mubarak&apos;s rule to suppress the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The government should also, it says in the draft, &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; protect &quot;and promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> The wording is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> No article, writes explicitly equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also dubious is the wording of the &quot;insulting people,&quot; is forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of Leader? </seg>

<seg id="2016"> I cost some packaged. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it avoids Rakfisk to bring the nose, it is not a bad thing, such as sushi, which has been a coach for quite a long time. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no Kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in a dense, wet salt water barrels this autumn. </seg>

<seg id="2030"> Norway is primarily responsible for today&apos;s wealth since the early 1970&apos;s growth of the world&apos;s largest oil and Gasindustrien. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;but oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waiter who round trays with reifem Rakfisk distributed and the stechend with her long blonde hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> As the saying goes, we are a sensible people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Her English is exactly like that of most people here above reproach. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway is handled very careful with its oil wealth, a large part of the industries yields will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all with money raised it does not, Norway had closed its purse. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we ski in winter and in the summer, can go, we are happy,&quot; Anna says. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;and of course Rakfisk eat,&quot; it adds with unbeschwertem laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow and am Rakfisk to another court-I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> This elk burger is definitely something else. I enjoy the juicy meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I logiere, is one of several Olympic venues resorts to organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best-or perhaps the most challenging smell sense-fish can vote. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live TV on which a bird served Showmaster, which is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What point number you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;here are our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> The Grand Coalition and laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly by the aquavit. </seg>

<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to office, Will Grant analyzed by the BBC challenges and the mixed feelings of its people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently is particularly bad traffic in Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday, a ring of steel built, several important transport routes in the capital absperrt and is causing havoc on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, the aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto binde the president and the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon&apos;s was able to prove economically Mexico, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the past six years already has cost 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence,&quot; said Pena Nieto earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> With the US president before he was on an equal footing, Pena Nieto Mexico as governor of his home state. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, rambling part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the divided opinions on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town Valle del Bravo they, for example, to remember him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Inhabitants of the holiday site write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>

<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect him real and lasting change,&quot; his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the congressman for the party Pena Nietos works, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Especially with regard to security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The congressmen Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a man of great direct, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was an outstanding statesman, especially if it but also listen to someone who can. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the Heads of many people do not share this view on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are crucial urban in nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military, in order to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a spots land near a large landfill in the last two years alone were the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of Governor Pena Nieto in the state of Mexico more than 1,000 women have been murdered, a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the killing of innocent women is notorious. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos believe that the problem of feminicide during his tenure at least is not properly addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But in the worst case, his government have closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a Betonbau, typical of the rundown neighborhoods, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as I think they are photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events Mariana 2010 committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that it was murdered by their partners. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed,&quot; remembers Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that they had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already started. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While their mother told that their history of the wall a picture of Mariana down to us. It is not only a cross appropriate that takes a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want their verdict simply be accepted and shut up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But this is not possible, if there were so many flaws and failures,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the president receives binde, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> In the last six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised during his tenure, particularly in order to take care of this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president, he is so, as he was as Governor,&quot; says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But it is precisely the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My mexikanisch American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they remind them difficult times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just been running warehouse and arrived at the border, when a broad in my mind. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: One for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was a few seconds, uncertain, which I go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Zentralkalifornien and all my life was called &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston `Irish&apos; or my friends in New York `Italians&apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I opted for `mexikanisch Amerikanisch.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> My grandfather&apos;s and at home there was no need for acronyms or hyphenation. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I am speaking Spanish, at least good enough to me in this language at both ends of interviews. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent I will also. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and undertook in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> This week, I thought about that moment when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House, in order to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were all those issues that can be expected, when the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans are now as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc after example of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the Mexico&apos;s war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the country&apos;s leaders among vorgehaltenem gun, forced them to leave more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a US government officials even mildest criticism of Mexico, listening - in the Mexican press and among the country&apos;s elites-complaints about how the Americans currently dogging the sovereignty of their neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children Montezumas, on the war path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet is Mexico&apos;s biggest challenge in truth in Mexico&apos;s relationship with the more than 35 million Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, is that at a point in our family tree of a person, perhaps a parents &quot;or Großelternteil, offered no chance in Mexico, and immigrated to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases this person was a profile-dunkelhäutig, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may now live the American dream, visited good schools and good jobs have received, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live-not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes vague, but what our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is certainly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as monument a humiliating defeat and look to us, because we are not sufficiently mexikanisch. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish never good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> They argue that our existence is a symbol of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families not in Mexico has not failed, they would be gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would now see not caught behind the silk screen, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally in the United States as a child, I am reminded that tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this evil. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While it is US citizen, it feels as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans know that I have the feeling that neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It is the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we will be seen as an American. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I should learn during my trip, there is something that this relationship complicates: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bürgertums would resume their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should our American colleagues about how great a visit this country is and to exert pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injured feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I fear that you alone, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to deal with Mexico, the United States, one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment for how their families were treated only not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual blame, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new and uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to its end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that will not be lost or won </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first blush, optimism anything but appropriate in view of the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, have strengthened the week&apos;s fighting the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have the Israelis rolled back, even though his group had to great loss. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was considered Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent, from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren, before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could be to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the King. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Under President Mohamed Morsi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt-by far the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular tyrant who ruled Egypt until his overthrow 2011 30 years, had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Brotherhood verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on public opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove player Hamas, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> On the other hand, the Israeli hardliners opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defense system, &quot;Iron Dome,&quot; was able to prove and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israel will not be able to sleep more soundly at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the Sperranlagen, which in the West Bank and the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. This to protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared to be illegal, but always be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman allied with an even kämpferischeren group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this hinterlistigen Palestinians verhätscheln and allow them to make their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If it really had control over the West Bank, it would not just like their supporters in Gaza rocket fire? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, should they dare to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps be able to get the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could a thwarted them. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who now sit in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments little help to repair their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> That the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust to bring about a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israelis should also think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly one day will explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions to combat Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years will increasingly take its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a push from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is that the more people on both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: Two states, where Israel surrenders areas for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The small - - for the near future hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence to enforce this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now together with Turkey and Qatar stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by land swaps and a common to convince Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to get an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Also, Obama must play its part to encourage Israel to negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems as if it were also a reluctant participation. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws for single cigarette packaging are in force </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs, which is the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging came into force in Australia. It will brand logos and colors, and replaced by neutral, olivgrüne lid with graphic images are complicated, which sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick infants and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Aside from the different health warnings and images, from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> So that Australia is the world&apos;s strictest rules on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government wants to young people smoking, by eliminating the glamorous image of the tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> It is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26 to smoke, with 99% likely person then no longer use. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can already see among children younger age that they understand the message, the tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image,&quot; Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies have shown that children, for example, a logo with the idea of the Crown Princess associate. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of multinationals, consider other countries have similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It was said, with the laws would benefit the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters are far greater quantities of these products offer on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for cigarettes etuis and silicone cap to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the corporations British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on Australian Supreme Court with their protest against the laws failed. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale transactions and await new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> This is a good business for us. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the hole in the popularity of social media in precisely the population on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, forbids them from a sports sponsors, most traders, cigarettes in shops no longer forced to interpret. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet changed. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned online advertising by local companies and sides, however, has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If tobacco marketed and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, on the Internet is not around,&quot; says Becky Freeman healthcare, a researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook has Freeman brand, which has been an increase in the number of experience of &quot;ordinary people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask the question: Is the only an individual who likes Marlboro cigarettes, so much that even includes a video or a marketing agency has to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than concentrate marketing to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules, those countries in the World Trade Organisation complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected for in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which consider similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001, the treatments warnings vorschrieb. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers are defiantly. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images does not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignoring them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;it is simply a touch and the box is away,&quot; says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes to a photograph with a mouth tumor is printed. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operators of tobacco trade &quot;King of the Pack&quot; in downtown Sydney, says that the single packaging has its shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I have an hour earlier needed to supply einzusortieren, now I need four,&quot; Yu says. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes-then we said OK, that&apos;s all we close,&quot; he visibly angry adds. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly elektrisierten world it is nice to be bored as well </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (available) and, of course, tax-free shopping. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> If it is up to them, it is for us and our children-OK, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This is the brain forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may promotes creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom, not more. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no.. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I come back. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> How many people I am also always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The boredom actually has a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The House panels Pompejis ziert a Latin inscriptions on boredom that dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is in many ways defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom, experience as &quot;a satisfactory to activity, but it cannot be able to define.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom differs from apathy so that the person is not employed, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> In the case of the apathy, there is no rush to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience boredom, he says, in a &quot;disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom is almost as well as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions in the problem could be linked, bored people around them or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that is dull, even if we just have difficulties to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study &quot;The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention&quot; - German around: &quot;The untätige minds: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention,&quot; which in September in the journal &quot;Perspectives on psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues&quot; to an earlier experiment, in which participants a band listen a person to read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud TV from neighboring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Other heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard this noise at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who barely recognisable television, heard said, to feel more boring than the other two groups - they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> However, if you a monotonous work, &quot;as the search for faulty products on a factory förderband, music can help us and not to feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;studies have shown that children who keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to stillsitzen,&quot; Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We will all eventually boring-my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people bore more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a &quot;range in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the Richter scale statements such as `many things I have to do, and monotonous &quot;and&quot; I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using the scale, researchers found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida, particularly the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But generally, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, communities and Reed Larson, a professor of human development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in school and do the homework were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, he was sure that &quot;the youth is seen as particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because people in extreme cases it leads to extreme physical risks and gambling or drug addicted to alleviate it, which studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;with the boredom will the brain a say that we should do something else,&quot; Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain do not always know what it is best to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If a is dull and the energy used to play Gitarre and cook, will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can provide for feelings of happiness in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So who his gelangweilten child an iPad, it can distract you from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself or control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;self-regulation is conveyed by a situation on the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not to take a critical view them. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our objective should be to give us away from the constant activity - and technology berieselung wohlzufühlen. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds as we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people of truth only trying to find a way to shut down and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in an environment in which we are constantly being überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Of the 19 years of community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in the southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he this rauchte. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> According to Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and drug supplies-Kavaliersdelikte, each labeled with a penalty of $100 - and received a court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But it is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the state&apos;s decision to legalise small amounts of marijuana to find the answer in hundreds of smaller drug offences less depends on the law, as the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of order widrigkeiten that revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in Colorado&apos;s more conservative districts, announced Marihuanadelikte to quote and people are still in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time vote several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, new state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington are perplexed at your head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that Colorado in any case is further ahead than most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. The drug was only there for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well in orientation,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent that we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, known as I - 502, enters into force on 6 December and is also a gray area in the bottom of the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this period - for example, as the government imposition of &quot;reasonable access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;location anywhere, it will be difficult for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, &quot;a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November Chief Oates his staff in Aurora sent an e-mail in which he said that the public prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; will not seek Strafanzeigen for these offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban plans for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers would continue to be monitored. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many have been indicted for other offences. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt was crimes,&quot; buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country club, shows no longer adults for the possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also chose not to drop all outstanding possession procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I verschwende my time, the law until it is changing,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters in Colorado, supported the measure was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana in line with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions throughout the state, local officials released a profound dilemma when it comes to the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> In district prosecutors if it were a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the defendants on trial for Marihuanadelikte and on the ground as the spokesman for the national organization for reform of Marihuanagesetzen. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that they still cannot accept the legalization,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana, alcohol, Colorado and Washington and national test-cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they also nervously await instructions from the federal government, the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement will succumb to hope that the Ministry of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several aufsehenerregender arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states largely. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that law enforcement officials are unlikely to enter doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but who are likely to resist the legal under the new legislation, state regulated marijuana to tolerate business. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open for at least a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, it probably will be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to get into a position where we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against this change in the law. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Later, we opted for what the community and not according to what the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was mobbed, because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not only university students today will be attacked for their views </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It has always been my greatest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once thought for the world&apos;s largest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-free thinking and tolerance -. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase and the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said that I would be because I had a problem with that fellow in neighbouring rooms had sex. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I walked away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, because I was suffered systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because I unusual name, or because I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason in this alleged cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favor of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organised and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal rights protection in the same benefits, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) give the Corpus Christi College, they are often isolated actively, because their political views &quot;personally attacked and declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They are calling for a place in the equality committee of college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Its situation has been exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,&quot; the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It has been shown, inter alia graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities say conservative students, they are as &quot;scapegoats&quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The 20-year Luke black, Vice President of the University of Nottingham Association of conservative students, in a Sunday newspaper said: &quot;There is a growing Linkstendenz universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without met us at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is &quot;unpleasant.&quot; The 19 years Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that it has a growing opposition to students in JCR members watched the moderate right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> As I was incredibly timid those aged 18 in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university voted in favor, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to cuts in higher education to give no official title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first week of the incoming days, in the new students to get to know each other and the Tutoren, I received a foretaste of the future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory students not only duldeten, but even with joy attended it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues such as miners strike, the government&apos;s privatisation and the rejection of sanctions against South Africa&apos;s apartheid regime found their way into the holzgetäfelten areas of Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In the first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century. What should come, I was not taken. </seg>

<seg id="2442"> I,. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face as pie pastry and quite invidious. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?&quot; he asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students kicherten. </seg>

<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, to a level of 2386 metres, but the exhausted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the rate of turtles, and they have to be careful in their actions and keep the balance, so that they do not slip and fall. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> You know that each step can cost as much as their lives, as happened to a French tourist who years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted. </seg>

<seg id="2572"> He earned $75,000 rupees (6.2) day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family returned after Banyuwangi, a village near the in Indonesia, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur: &quot;I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought it to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often because of the toxic gases gereizt. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27 year-old Anto, after three years of his life on Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur at him, even though he has already taken the first traces with a face mask and Spezialbrille covers. </seg>

<seg id="2591"> The grandfather of his five children works with his 30 years as sulphur winner. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> As time passes, but the poverty generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: Those who as human burden esel on Kawah Ijen work. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singapurer people lay the blame for the fact that they have no children, career, the stress and the cost of housing and child rearing. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore must grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The rates are part of a song, the local Rapper slogans such as &quot;pushing a&quot; Bao &quot; (loaf) in the kiln, about the low birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, which has made the video, preserves the hope that the advert in an entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to meet their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only on the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The equipment we are the worst in the world, so we remarked that this is an issue that we have to look. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed dating agencies evenings (rapid Flirts). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Therefore we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Each year, they are $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has so far had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city state in the southeast Asia, including for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to its national population authority is the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time this rate was more than 2, which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why don&apos;t get the Singapurer more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Ming, director of the national population authority for marriage and family policy, says that this is the result of a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot; `major career prospects. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities have higher number of single and helped delay marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a surge in Zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment in the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> There are websites in Singapore, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants is, especially against the Chinese who criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate the repercussions on a nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> It has already impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small Appartements, are known as the &quot;shoe boxes&quot; and must be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square meters and show a large sales success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> But the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of a single person, and that they will deter construction companies to build large housing for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; much faster than bigger houses sell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The result is that they are very much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously placed obstacles in the way that they too many small units within a project to build. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore, a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate could, the talks with the Singapurern, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it is delayed by many people,&quot; says a young managers. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The children can get. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;it is important for me to have my own money and time,&quot; says another, about 20 years old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as reasons that they cannot have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> This is why the Singapurer have the last word, when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The offline private offline is online private </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary, it is the private or &quot;those area of privacy, where people are entitled to protection against any kind of interference.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2647"> He understands the dangers that it is suspended when he known situations on the Internet, which he would not share in real life? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> EL Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which are often on the Net. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases they linked the concept with &quot;something very own on a personal level&quot; and &quot;the password and user,&quot; if it on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets I would not announce in a postal&quot; the 10-year-old Jorge says in an attempt, the meaning of &quot;private&quot; in Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live messenger to explain where he accounts for two years. </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this Cyberbullying,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with degrees in education and learning, says that about the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;the Internet as a medium for the search for information; with the publication of these sides, but the rules of the game have changed,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in teaching at Yale University and author of the plant &quot;Digital Natives and immigrant&quot; these concepts to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The Digital Natives they are, children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants, they are supposed to teach, when we even learn,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand that they have a defined criterion of what, can be published or said, in an age where the maturity of this is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They will also be wählerisch, if it is most important for them to be popular, thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, which gives them pause for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;to tell you that they should not do it, does not work,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras calls then some possibilities: There are things you not tell strangers würdest. Why you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would like it if we published a photograph of you, such as the one that you have published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other on you publish? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> You have asked for permission from the others before, if you have labeled photographs of celebration? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: All need to know what you at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> It is the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;someone outside of the Internet, with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, Grundschullehrer and educational consultants, it commented on that essential that parents carefully the directives of the social networks. </seg>

<seg id="2703"> Conclusion of the summit of Unasur without publishing the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publishing the Lima Declaration, which had previously announced and in theory the rulers of the seven should be signed. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the Heads of State and President firm initially told that they were handed over after the closing, according to some time later, however, that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>

<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was hosting the Third Summit South America-Arab states (ASPA), and also on this occasion, despite strong calls by the press the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously announced, nor published. </seg>

<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe must &quot;economic consolidation (in Latin America) does not accept triumphant trains, but is designed to increase our output and a better future for our peoples,&quot; Humala added. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided, to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects, the space links in South America and especially in rural and border areas designed to improve... and therefore our countries unite and open up new type of business,&quot; said the Peruvian President in a statement read. </seg>

<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America continue to an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that emphasized at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his counterparts of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime conflict after a ruling by the ICJ of Bogotá in question to be treated respectfully. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;I may be tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with the President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said. </seg>

<seg id="2739"> Peru has the chairmanship of the regional bloc for time. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, and &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, on 6 summit attended by the president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, the Peruvian state television said that the Europeans were killing &quot;in the Second World War and other conflicts&quot; and &quot;today are practically a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> With this in mind, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which promote the Unasur&apos;s member states. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community ist;es are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the agreement of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who teach, never commit themselves to something, and in return, we are signing the South Americans all the time. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States,&quot; he told as a reference to the political asylum in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa asserted that he does not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views about human rights,&quot; has fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it was &quot;justified suspicions had been handed over to a third country that Assange and his trial would not complied with.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> It also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him on its territory him undergo interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while &quot;the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference, the had Ecuador in London on the message can be carried out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;since it is in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has, however, informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,&quot; said the head of state Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> , there is a risk that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space and cannot conduct physical exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;that would be detrimental to the health of everyone,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa stated that the solution to the asylum that Assange in London for the month of June in Ecuador&apos;s message was granted to the granting of a Freibriefs, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the judicial authorities would be Europe&apos;s. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution to the captive founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with the human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there have been constant talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the judicial authorities Europe because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures in various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain morning this licence granted, I believe that this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message Ecuador in London or on Skype verhörte, as the Swedish law allows and in other cases, the problem will be done. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate &quot;the mediocrity that bad faith and weaken the lie that freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who after profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense that he congratulated Ecuador no longer of such journalists &quot;and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries,&quot; he and I think in a re-election &quot;will deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision, the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain &quot;hard and no opportunism and should never grant verkleideten coup to be legal,&quot; because it &quot;the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, with Nicaragua to negotiate for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> This judgment is not implemented at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South and Central American nation. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be comprehensively so that they can be overcome and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also familiar to a successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America, international bodies to oblige, if both countries to adopt the ruling, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Regarding the possibility that he is as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he sees this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although it sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally but in unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the belief that I was the one who this likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I retreat from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had visited South Africa, planned for a routine treatment, and that would expected that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It is in no way a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader, today in Lima on 6 summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Cause of a dying of AIDS is today a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry, confirmed HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb hit,&quot; he says on the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to look just about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of unity of the HIV Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) live for 22 years, was at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, stigma was a few treatment and more. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then it avoided even the director of the IMSS to a clinic, &quot;because it into a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, many people are still in the clinic who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already damage and their immune system has run out of steam, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world. In other words, the date of the first reported cases, &quot;the great success today means that the survival of a patient&apos;s treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year was supported by a respected scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life on the level of damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment law, and that the greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above mean that, who at the age of 25, the diagnosis is HIV positive, &quot;can be easily 75 years old in this sense, as long as it is under control,&quot; the expert said. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to be able to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality has significantly reduced in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (reduced annual report ONUSIDA)), it is true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of patients covered by the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year are already 187 deaths, however, said that it is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why so people still die? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems of drug supply. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a resounding statement: &quot;nine out of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, and all persons, where necessary, massive screening tests must be provided.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients as Fabrizio, which has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage and even the Kaposi Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we want to hear nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I was going to die, then burst,&quot; says one to three times in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The amendment was to improve, I ernähre me well, treibe sport and take the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life as anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I have a lot of work, it does, an active, but responsible Sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person,&quot; Fabrizio, which agreed to include his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner we know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to as all people can live responsibly. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which adopted the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the certain places &quot;was the distribution of condoms; previously, they were actually increased individually, now give us with a hundred little packages, which already is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> One of the risk for new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need?&quot; is a widespread Spottfrage of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to suspend assured the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilet facilities, which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted the promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They are not paid the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether under his administration would be distributed condoms. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it more succinctly. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data from Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen nationally in fourth place new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in terms of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of Ansteckungsfälle takes place through sex, 6% on the blood and 2% perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are registered for each case 4 or 5 people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> After the Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment of the United States, which does not recognize the group&apos;s debt restructuring Vitro that has been achieved on a trade konkurs in Mexico, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in the neighbouring country has created the payment problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> You could say that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the recognition by the judge&apos;s ruling handed down on 15 June Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river bravo helpless. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> But the decision opens the door to largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, for three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2871"> &quot;My life I went to the basketball, even several put many hats at the same time, when I President of BSN, CEO and President of the Association was in the 1990s,&quot; remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years, lives. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes exaggerates with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón at the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotionalsten memories are those who are skeptical about his time in the middle of the 1950s Vaqueros as players until 1982, where his 15-year anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;These were my best years I have enjoyed most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach privilege. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I adopted a championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then took &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good managers, &quot;Reyes says. </seg>

<seg id="2885"> I remember, as he said that, if Mincy facilitated a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another would provide. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship the Vaqueros with Gausse he was granted, but from a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At the time he preferred his enforcement and Mincy to enjoy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we first won at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who won 2004 against the dream team at the Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we gold in 1991, and the US team won a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas López, Fico and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also included the young players (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, León (Francisco brothers and Edgar) and Mario Morales, the 1990 &quot;Quixote&quot; could not be because of a knee injury. </seg>

<seg id="2896"> Who was the best players of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz. </seg>

<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated as Piculín at this level. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> As we had a number of good trainer Julio Toro, `Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What glaubst you is the best thing that you have achieved in the Association? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the team&apos;s most successful era between 1988 and 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams involved in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What remains to be done you? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I have introduced, such as the regionalisation of lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children many unnecessary trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, table, officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, see my time in YouTube videos of music, enjoy my grandchildren, and I am going to a basketball game. </seg>
