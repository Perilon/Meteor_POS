<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the centre of the native believe the last myth, saying that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition, Republican Lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing we can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is why most of the governments of the states pass laws since 2009,, process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has brought a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only for one 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 2011 was taken 41 state. </seg>
<seg id="11"> new election laws require voters to produce photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting,, right voter registration day expression and undercut the citizens who have the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> before the 2006 elections, not a single American state insists voters show photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> INDIANA became the first state, who introduced a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, enacted in Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities rushed to spread this practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years they have initiated bills, forcing voters to produce photo ID, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike Quebec American citizens do not have universal ID, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people, under the required age, do not have photo ID for voting, given the government the authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of the required identity often exceeds a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people easily less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> students are eligible voters, who, as is, to vote for candidates from the Democrats, and in several states are not allowed to use the ID card with photo, issued their educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states permit members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote in mainly for the Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> until 2004, no, demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship for voting. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Such a requirement was introduced for the first time in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> since 2011, more than ten states have laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Obviously, these measures aim to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have laws in 2011,, voter registration on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction was not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign helped make in voter registration lists at about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% fall in the level of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> During the 2008 general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance, were in Florida -- even though the last were only 13% of the total number of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened and come from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike White, which, by forming 76% of voters, only 46% among those who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="42"> of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters are actively against laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> several draft laws was Was governors-Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> the most ambiguous laws was suspended with the intervention of the Prosecutor-General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has partly to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws requiring the charge of identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules were in effect will, of course, the implementation of the election law in the 2012 elections. </seg>
<seg id="48"> criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them the obvious focus, to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Centre of native from 2011 report demonstrates that states adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing clearly: these new provisions will have negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the dog sometimes makes erroneous test results, and sometimes Sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to To medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, have something to hesitate, even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and it is hard to work out any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time European found different mortality in patients who were screened and those who did not take place at all. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the likelihood of a metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who have not passed the screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to take from 40 or 50 years, test, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of the black origin also are at higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is making the right decision, as only the cancer is detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> cancer can be as aggressive and And. </seg>
<seg id="65"> patients need to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life, and making the choice in the long run, in these cases, in favour of active disease surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, who have detected the cancer, treatment will take place, as their cancer not aggressive and poses no threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We&apos;ll offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, we can define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not be a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore, I would recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not, you need to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of urology,, created the tool to assess all the pros and cons of the test on the dog. </seg>

<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe, to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all great people were and del raco enough move, 30 per cent of cases could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, this figure rose would be at least 50 percent,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10% of the cases of cancer caused by its heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> for the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> and it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It causes enormous damage to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said press secretary Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> encouraging fact: Ten years after the surrender of smoking decreases risk of dying from cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> they increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; added to the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> in too large quantities it increases risks of colon cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> you should also avoid sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> shutdown by smoked meat, drying or Or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The past can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explained in the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists were studying the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But the results of these studies cannot be clear at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D is also full clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr. Beaulieu stresses, however, that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> &lt;S&gt; Higgs in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer a message stating, that scientists may be able to detect Detect Higgs, caused a real boom-- and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this This explains a lot all particles in the universe, not much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model, our best, or, in any case, &quot;the least imperfect&quot; descriptions of nature and behavior of matter-but which have never before been found experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physics is not yet sure what he was talking about About Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it greatly resembles Resembles Higgs predicted the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data, presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems this is confirmed, although some data still lacks confidence. </seg>
<seg id="111"> it&apos;s all the same, that we are talking about About Higgs, as the chances of error seem minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There are, in this world of one law absolutely inevitable, said that two things may not be in the same place in one and the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way around this rule, does not even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of similar nature: The principle of excluding Pauli, which posits that the two particles can Can occupy the same space in one and the same time, if they are in one and the same &quot;elementary&quot; is a &quot;condition&quot; is, in general, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, share the particle physics on the two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find a decent citizens, called Called wisely obey the principle Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In another scurrying around Around, a stark gang anarchists, who have no respect to anything-at least to this principle, which means that they may be used to be in the same place in one and the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to website (by the way, is completely extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley lab, these These shared, in turn, to two groups::, on which we will not talk, and &quot;force&quot;, through which apply the basic forces of nature, and which in some ways is Is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same Same, it should be stressed, not all exotic creatures, such as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this chronicle, thanks to one incredibly Incredibly банальному::, or &quot;light&quot;, which is &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle with the electrical charge, or changes direction, it &quot;violates the&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, like stone, now in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> &quot;violations&quot; is born of electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is no more than a A-and, therefore, one of the The &quot;vectors of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is happening with the The Higgs, with the only difference that, to this This appeared, should be &quot;violated&quot; another field, the Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field are much, much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to bring it to achieve very high energies, as if it was about About integrate, the surface of which could move only a very big stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> So why do we need a huge particle accelerator, as the ring, which operated in the CERN large hadron collider, which with 27 km diameter!-- to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field is useful also for explaining the relationship between Between Higgs and weight. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will keep in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like the Photon, incidentally) It does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what can bring &quot;all these studies, asked Ms. Ms.? </seg>
<seg id="132"> in science, they are used to validate the standard model (CM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the observations and forecasts see results. </seg>
<seg id="133"> In addition, some of them are eager to this divergence was because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (Ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates roughly 80% of the universe (ouch-Ouch!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But until the CERN such disparities have never been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser in the Bell Labs research could not even guess what revolution to bring about their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> they foresaw their applications in science, but no more than that. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at bell laboratories, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous momentum) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a &quot;laboratory gadget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> and in addition, the application may be for instruments, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Same Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, though it wasn Wasn his original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the The will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume soon, and is preparing the Bill at this time. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, much remains to be done in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;The debt&quot; tried to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. l. still lived alone in his apartment in In. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Cancer of the prostate,, within, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years I lived for seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the orphanage in the palliative care Victor-- гадбуа where arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock to this it is impossible to prepare for,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease makes his work: incredible weakness, which does not own to go to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> sitting at a table, on which there is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He He, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medication, lead in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage before death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest desire, cured me from diarrhea, it&apos;s humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found the cure of this malaise. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;in life, we are taught that a man must pee standing up,&quot; says Pierre Pierre, a psychologist at the orphanage in the victor--. </seg>
<seg id="162"> regress to the condition of the child-for some an unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It all depends on the human ability to&quot; live with the decline, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> as, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events Events and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> patients who received palliative shelter Victor--, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> forecasts see them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called &quot;therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. and 89 years, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to see their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in life,&quot; she said, before you allow to put her mask, developing breathing. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It is still waiting for her son&apos;s last visit in the coming days, recruited from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> in the orphanage Victor Victor by groups of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is the palliative care, which remains, nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> to make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> one place in Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants in palliative care institutions. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> life goes on in the best conditions, any possible, explains Dr. Christian Christian, one of the doctors shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> whether physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> dying, we agree to provide Provide wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he will ask. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We no longer make diabetics control blood sugar levels. </seg>

<seg id="183"> yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. X, who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> His son Son this beer in the legs late in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We&apos;re helping relatives, as well as the patients,&quot; says Natalie Savar, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At the orphanage in the victor-- nor one day is similar to the previous one. </seg>

<seg id="188"> &quot;In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; says a doctor Christian Christian. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients receiving shelter Viktor Viktor, come out of the house, and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem is access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, the care is available, to ease the suffering of the patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> and some institutions, such as the victor-shelter Shelter and palliative care at home of the Montreal society, are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this large gap in the system of public health in Quebec City that makes many doctors-palliative care experts fear the law,, there and help in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October manifesto signed Signed circulates in the field of palliative care, Dr. Dr. балфуром and Dr. Bernard Bernard and indicate their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christian Christian, Quebec health system effective, is not enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before they will be allowed to transfer to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, &quot;I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my cases that I stop treatment, she answered me that regrets that I stop the fight, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> with it, I said that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Dr. believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank doctors and nurses, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the palliative care team makes their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely the omnipotent in the struggle with the pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to To Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to To in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or constantly. </seg>
<seg id="207"> can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> more and more patients who do not manage to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> patients suffering from pain, always speak with one and the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want I spent there&quot;, it means &quot;I want me to become easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible by the journalist grant from the Canadian Institute for Health research. </seg>
<seg id="212"> large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of the political parties and the Italian mafia experts day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot;,, construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi. </seg>

<seg id="333"> I have seen many things, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play a good qualifier matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is something that I have had since my baptism of blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave well. </seg>

<seg id="725"> So far, no one is predicting this wave in the ninth, a shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> shares of the support the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> in addition to raising their modest salaries, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and a system of fast food, to the organizers of the protests is the establishment of trade union organizations in them. </seg>
<seg id="728"> As long as this sector of the economy Don Don reflect the trade-union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Stocks began last week, after the Thanksgiving holiday, in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America has fallen orgy of low sales, annexed millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by By. </seg>
<seg id="731"> In this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people all over the world, have left their jobs and And Corporation along with trade unions and left-wing activists, shops, whose product is counted on modest and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many underpaid workers Walmart Walmart only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> availability and range of goods made Walmart, one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods sell-off partly because little pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, for example, the shortage of diesel or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; required to raise wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 US dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> the average employee Walmart Walmart 9.5 dollars per hour, this consumption can not afford, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase Increase salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If the whole Walmart Walmart wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the shop will get them to 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, they will spend on any; dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protest took place only in nine states and corporations have no No damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its point-of-sale devices made in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Corporation spokesman Dan Dan argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that jobs left &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees in total, and that the protest was just &quot;another Another gimmick&quot; slaughtering its union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;free ticket!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, where their target were not stores Walmart (in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore not yet), and &quot;took&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Mcdonald says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn Didn even gives you a hospital and never pays you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> &lt;S&gt; Williams, a member of the City of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the Federal and New York legislation is Is dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> fast-food restaurants it improves over time, but not much, and their rank-and-file workers receive on average in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one earns less than them in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can exist in New York on such money, incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> once through the &quot;took&quot; was almost a quarter of American teenagers who Who function for them after school, living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> few who saw in the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I am constantly coming across in an interview with the &quot;&quot;, who complain that should live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the forum newspaper The Wall Street Journal, hangs a comment, the author notes that irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, that you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants of the protest, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald&apos;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and beyond fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, have more than doubled their current minimum wages. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast-food sector trade union organizations were created. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits this Administration to prevent and punish trade unionists ungrounded and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the Administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But a Union embrace fast food and difficult due to objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the major turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> &lt;S&gt; </seg>
<seg id="767"> noisy protests took place in this day and a range of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day, McDonald&apos;s rally near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Council Williams, who says: &quot;MacDonald&apos;s, that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you a hospital and never pays you for honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrators have supported and other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city of Bill de De, insisted that &quot;we must all join in support of fast food workers so that they have a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new New!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As New York Times has described what happened, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of the quick catering, which employed tens of thousands of people in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is unclear whether this spark the flames will mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as the fool the brain is secondary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> popular among fans of modern technologies with the subject of Augmented Reality in recently decided to take in largely through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> first summer at their annual conference, current model showed Google, and then it became known that the corresponding patent application filed in November and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> But from our conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in the laboratory Laboratory Microsoft Microsoft шарамом that points the company passed the stage for scientists. </seg>
<seg id="777"> attracted by the prospect of manipulation of them virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> tell us, please, in general, than your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;We are human interaction with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> As mankind in mass Mass on stage work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes Sometimes finger in them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict drastic changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the standard Xbox and sensors Xbox Xbox is a step forward, and almost no one today without the The is not for sale, because all the interesting Interesting management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> &quot;that still lies ahead of us? </seg>
<seg id="784"> &quot;Despite the fact that the The had interaction at the physical level, much is still on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The improved data (the system gets more information), and the conclusion is not yet very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including Including. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to release a computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> and, first and foremost, to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - what do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but not overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> &quot;It&apos;s definitely not a panacea-raises the question of privacy, because they do not always want to notify people about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all of the types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we had a project to control devices in public places, in the framework of which we thought gestures, but not over Over, and such being stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not the camera device, and And bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> He&apos;s big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristwatches. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general, the future is mixed, for example, the gesture control + voice type. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;This is how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> &quot;For example, how can you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks? </seg>
<seg id="801"> you say and show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> &quot;I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> &quot;You want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> &quot;It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely define the human reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution for depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;If you&apos;re talking about your work with the Xbox Xbox sensor, do you have any claims to the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> The lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> In principle, the current generation, from which you can work in our work on the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get Megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 to / from. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it&apos;s not in the The themselves, and as a matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the latest point of view all current technologies are not good enough for us-it adds the designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> There is need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X and Y and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also very important, the number of frames per second rate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> movements quite dynamic and current 30 to / with frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Stephen of our Our laboratory made touch sensor with adjustable delay processing-from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> not all understand how this affects the interaction between people and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work was the equivalent of such a device, but does not require Require frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;and the number of cameras increase does not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> &quot;&quot; currently have three cameras &quot;, one of which actually-infrared emitter, and second, the reflected signal receiver. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But already the third camera is, actually, a sensor of the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of payments. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create flexible similar to To, play with the curved location of cameras and see how it will help in determining the provisions. </seg>
<seg id="827"> &quot;As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> you don Don think that from the point of view of everyday use Augmented Reality glasses-it is one of the most promising technology platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;of course, slob around all the time, holding a Smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but here&apos;s what I think: the most tough option would be&quot; restricted Restricted &quot;reality, when the cloud-based platform you could switch from points on the Smartphone, the projection display and on everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> points are very personal device, their strength (private things see weakness only you), and at the same time-restricted on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual reality objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Tony from&quot; iron man, &quot;but an ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> there is one problem, which often indicate criticism of such ideas: No tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In his lectures, I often say that the amended reality is seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth may well be additive tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So far, one of the most interesting tricks-use of second hand as a substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It registers perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is a technology that is really aimed at giving this &quot;images in the air&quot; &quot;осязаемости several aimed ultrasound beams at a certain point, for example, where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak-as if you blew on the PADS. </seg>
<seg id="840"> and there are the bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;You tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> to make him think he feels something like should feel at that moment, when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;This is a good idea, we have not yet tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is another problem, which will have to fight for a long time-how to make human, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is open, almost infinite-work and over the concepts of cross-country tracks (not in the clubs such as), moving platforms, as well as huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Yet fool the brain is secondary, work is still very many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> that&apos;s what makes working on virtual reality such attractive for researcher-many things in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> &lt;S&gt; &lt;/s&gt; &lt;/S&gt; instead of culture </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;&quot; &quot;continues to project&quot; avant-garde &quot;, dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead in the vanguard of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this top-list already were bright figures art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the boundaries of the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> A new hero &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> the whole town knows Kirill Miller-bearded man dressed in red, which meets all the Russian Museum, the summer Garden, a fashionable parties and And. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Kirill Miller always collect crowds wherever they were. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller-one of a St. Petersburg socio-philosophical Philosophical, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he of the city, its appearance on the streets calling smile have citizens Citizens all mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took the going and became the St. Petersburg Petersburg, as ripe for this complex role of all its Its existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill, and why are you still sitting in the city around the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose the color red as designer, who views and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, it is a compromise between red artist Artist and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society all that a little excitement not grey, causes aggression and malign properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at to began the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> the whole history of my provocative shares is an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;And when you realized that you have to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> The exhibition in the Palace Square, where my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> then the wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and new, free like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friendly with the artists new wave, with With, which led to the &quot;Pushkin-10&quot;, and there was no more waves. </seg>
<seg id="868"> my throws in all genres, clothes, music, theatre, in addition to words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> &quot;And it&apos;s all come together in your art-clinic... it was important for me to go in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where should meet all the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I took territory at the Pushkin-10, repair and there until it was, there was a musical and artistic, bohemian club, club house of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there::, tequila-jazz, I remember how string led with the project, &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was &quot;the people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;the Artist of the Year&quot; was named I ended my culmination. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times, the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, honesty and the culture of the last century. </seg>

<seg id="897"> &quot;Now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disintegration of the crops. </seg>

<seg id="908"> I wrote these paintings in his youth that they have one collector on the wall next to the The фальком Hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, is another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused to money for the sake of drawing paintings. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I&apos;m for such a culture here. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Cyril, what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a concept: The official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone of them can do culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the right Tsars all is not as it was, the kings, may not really understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> here in Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> People in St. Petersburg, we have, that could be experts, but they are closed, as are higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now Now thrives. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Same, but distinguishes them what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept there are artists who should look to other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> &quot;What for you-Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg-this is not a cultural capital, culture in Moscow, where the soil is much more. </seg>
<seg id="926"> and it is difficult to grow our stones art. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>

<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing unusual. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It&apos;s like time was Was, but again, this is an experiment, and such research must be carried out,&quot; said Vladimir Vladimir. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing space rats appeared offspring. </seg>

<seg id="973"> &quot;Because nobody on this question answered,&quot; says veteran Vakhtang Vakhtang rocket and space industry. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>

<seg id="1001"> Chief Security Audit: checking Schwartz-management system has failed due to the fault of the politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement, Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit management, from an interview for the site Site </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but apply it must correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have,&quot; commented on the current situation Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practice lead Peter Peter approach to so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The prime minister recently said that the The (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother audits are permitted-is prohibited or entrepreneurs? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be installed in any way and, if he does, and the prime minister can Can resist the institutions, which are required to verify and achieve the implementation of the commitments,&quot; concludes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which it was associated public procurement legislation in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What, exactly, was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> there is a parallel check, which we started in mind, probably two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is about the fact that European law says, how should be public procurement, the national legislation, and then also apply in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All the information has been collected and, even when the still unfinished audit revealed some interesting differences-to put it simply, the legislation we have can be &quot;accurate and unmistakable&quot;, but in practice we in certain parameters behind Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, should focus on the application of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> but actually this project can help you, what it means for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> economy means getting the appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always) price to avoid low enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> but not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system System &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than it would be if the restriction is not dropped. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> you&apos;re talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> and how the control system operates in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> is there such an organization as our security Security (kru) or is it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards the institutions, as our chickens there is the The, arranged according to our principle, there is also the Board, working a bit differently, but mainly in both institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the powers are alike, but to a certain extent because Germany has federal structure, there are divisions of the audit and the level of federal lands in their system is different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &lt;S&gt; can only manage the federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the federal level adding chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation, easier than we have there? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not have wanted to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can take for example, but you cannot say definitely that it better throughout. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is because they are better at dealing with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Certainly there is no such comparisons, but, I repeat, I do not like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I must say that even the main countries are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your establishment of the amendments to the law on government procurement, somehow manifest consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force of these amendments very short, it has not worked in our control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we have control over the fact, you need to take into account some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We take this into account in the preparation of future inspections, we have started to use our new &quot;risk Risk detection tool&quot;, through which we were taken away almost 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will come, because the conditions change change restrictions, some types of contracts and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or additional load on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that may arise, such that the rules &quot;&quot;, &quot;and it will be impossible to comply with. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> During the operation the previous rules controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes-with the Regional Council) that any violation of the law on government procurement means in violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In such a case, the enforcement of the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think that this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the formal mistake of not influencing the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> and then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s realize that this path does not lead anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> More recently, the Prime Minister said that it will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; is forbidden or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be installed in any way and, if he does, and the prime minister can Can resist the bodies, which are required to verify and achieve the implementation of the commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> you can say: &quot;we we would change this law and solve it,&quot; but you cannot say that we pretend that nothing is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The public procurement law contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally be, and this is right. This protects the public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only for formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but apply it must correctly, which, in my opinion, we don Don have enough. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland twentieth member of the European Space Agency was adopted as the second country from the former eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency (ESA) on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1994 and in the subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the way to space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights to space, but it is not always seen with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Let me remind you, for example, lectures and And, which on December 6, 1933, in Warsaw astronomical observatory ideas from his pioneering work &quot;introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The young engineer (1905) have left the audience, after several years of Of indifferent recalled that Dr. Jan Jan was only interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, France France won the prize Robert Robert эсно and Andre Luiz Luiz for &quot;introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Jan (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great he was astronomy and space science. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> hundreds of articles he published in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books, dedicated to these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> &lt;S&gt; became known world he was in space, and his contribution was evaluated in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> The Railway was built in 1925 in Poland already Already equipped with missile engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear, even for acceleration or braking rocket trolleys should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this era Era known only from the press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to worry about missile Missile. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> research section of the armament technology in collaboration with professors Professors мечиславом and Gustav Gustav. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> of the remaining material, you can see that studies have reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the advent of German troops were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, in the specialized press the idea of photovoltaic missiles-fighter, which offered Offered engineer, and the next year was the work of the &quot;air missile and torpedo aviation rocket-bomb&quot; author Author леливы. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war, all projects of military use rocket technology was a scientific Advisory Committee ((Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo), which coordinated the entire work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended due to the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work, dedicated to the aerospace, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (polskie Polskie Towarzystwo). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> for the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954, &quot;problems&quot;, in which four dimensional magazine articles Articles. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, Professor M. M. offered to organize society, which will be Be. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (() has been trying to join the international astronautics Federation (founded in 1951), and already in autumn Autumn became its member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> and in the following year, the first chairman of the The Kazimierz Kazimierz (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> from 1956 1956 contributed to the development of highly successful meteorological rockets RM ((Rakieta), which became the first Polish missile Missile scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first run was held on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket, capable to overcome the distance 1800 m, was 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently, the enhanced version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 1959 бледовском two-stage RM-2 missile tests were carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this research-RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was overseeing Overseeing wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But further development was suspended in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The heir to the first missiles RM became the meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 over the years. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight-- kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> There are three types of (marked as Meteor-1A,, and And), which varied in size camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Meteor-1A rocket had space of 0.4, Meteor-1B-0.34 L, and Meteor-1C--. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum flight range of all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> between 1965 and 1968, took place at the Aviation Institute Meteor-2 missile development, and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 missile with the initial 380 kg was able to cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> then the meteor-- versions were built and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> We should also mention the accession of Poland to the Committee on Space Research (cospar) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee of cospar two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, within the framework of the The, Poland, participated in studies of outer space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Miroslav became the second Second after Vladimir Vladimir. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision has provoked a lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It will certainly be interesting to look at the issues from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that separate economic units, national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade, and free, but limited the movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) price pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept should understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods to persevere in economic competition, &quot;is that&quot; the cost of a competitor with the aim of taking a large part of the market and, therefore, increase their income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> in the massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labour, compared with other high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> because private capital has no social responsibility, including for made them growing unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance by businesses to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social damage caused in their pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to bring specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> &lt;S&gt; methods of private capital are at the level of the economies of individual states, when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, to artificially reduce the social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the Government give its population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> First of all, this is reflected in changes to existing legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to economically to its Its ​ people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers&apos; rights in the field of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of the increased levels of poverty, and with it the difference between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> in Germany for several years already, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves in their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases occur, when employed people receive a salary that the state they must pay extra to receive subsistence minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> economic measures in almost all the southern countries of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people, under the pressure of the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on On salary on the margins of society, in the hope that private investment capital will come when something in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But the question is, where will it? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for a fraction of the European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, that managed the economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital has consistently insisted that the state should not management action to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Further, the question to be answered, not whether private capital, now almost managing policy, and to the entire state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> a definitive answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a practically Almighty and omnipresent lobby in all of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result, we have a hopeless situation,, in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources assigned to develop Bills private law firms that are associated with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these Bills the claims the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of a western-style, and from the powerful financial groups who own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly in such Such ​ situation, as it is described in In &quot;crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and pompey&quot;: &quot;The state had already split, and agencies are engaged in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> bribes, illegal favours with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice, &quot;&quot;... decent people are not candidates for the position of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul &quot;....&quot; seriously began to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for a vigorous man &quot;.... thought, that this will be the pompey, but they became Caesar, that finally replaced democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital has already essentially not intended for public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper nature. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> It means that the root causes of fascist and Communist regimes, we should look for in a foolhardy liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First of all, tragically, the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims, humanitarian and social disaster in the future, that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of the competition both at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the contribution of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken the monopoly position in favor of the state in society. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Violence will not do, and can never get out,&quot; Sting, the song &quot;fragile&quot;, where the main verse Verse are the words: &quot;Don Don forget what we are fragile.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1296"> I don Don want to speculate about who these periodically repeated waves of killings-perpetrator and victim, in the end, today&apos;s Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born on the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve going for 95 years voltage (apart from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning as historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is first of all the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> that is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently take their own steps, or for their throne was someone, who has guided them to the pre-set goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we are living in a period when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power could not happen for the life of one generation arising out of them. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the Octopus (I do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded)--. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many did not write about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop Rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher areas, and that has always been in the shadow of which they were to strengthen their power, multiplication of wealth, or simultaneously and and to another. </seg>

<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for For Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own ((- Government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963, Deputy Luis Luis was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>

<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, and the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and a third should lead to the reduction of the world&apos;s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (such number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> method, in which working group of the richest families headed by By, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao-order from chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which should prevent a recurrence of the crisis, caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war by killing Killing heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, inaugurating the Bolshevik Bolshevik. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended with a sudden, grounded in the warrior and economically surrender Germany (there was no longer a need for war destruction Tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, a fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austro-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations to Germany, rather than created the premise to a radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans strong enough Enough perpetrators and offers simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and indeed has the function of a fifth column of fueling the fire of war. </seg>

<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was provoked by military Military on the first world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed a war, to create a home third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will start, the Jewish people, and in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now together with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>

<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> In fact, that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from policy which, so to speak, by the US, to the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have not agreed upon a common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that until they are ending their role, but only on the way to &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> such foreign policy, which is France, or the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specifically means &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to take in its national interest, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from the exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests largely differ from the interests of the other large states, and why Germany must defend their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> whether these have economic interests on the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote in the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, this plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely unilateral communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> &lt;S&gt; Germany its relations with the United States, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote about Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that prevails in Europe and even in the U.S. understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don Don think that it was the same dramatic Dramatic, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Germany even will thus, perhaps, a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It signals that it should be seriously as a player on the international stage, and that its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> there is a divergence of views between the United States and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In the power of American domestic politics, such differences have always co-existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of the European position in the depths of our souls. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But the Government in connection with the local political situation, of course, could not take such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that considerable differences of opinion is not as significant, as always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama has not delighted by Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany&apos;s easy to combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the major partner in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes such a difficult situation for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there is one, a consistent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they may not be as part of a wider approach and are forced to act, instead relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is exactly what they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In the future, I think that Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that for Germany, this is difficult, at least because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This theme was always fine. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player-not really whether it will take on the role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> or the leading role still difficult given Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, always hard is to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various creation feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans Don Don just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, this is an old problem: you don Don want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must take into account the different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, the influence of the USA in the European policy has weakened, but at the moment, the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans just to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don Don like it, unpleasant or strengthens the enmity to you-this is life! </seg>

<seg id="1655"> But to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>

<seg id="1661"> in 2009 the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired Acquired manufacturer putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of the Mercedes. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Ruben believes U.S.-origin that Mexicans are caught between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall for the coming close to the border area and was on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> signs point to two: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second foreign language (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood in the few seconds before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and I called the Mexican life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish people consider themselves to be Italians, and friends from New York. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped on a complex structures &quot;Mexican American origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional titles or complex constructions. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary are poorer than native speakers, and I can Can get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took his American passport and was in turn for foreign language. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico&apos;s president-elect Enrique Enrique Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were familiar to meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> &lt;S&gt; Nieto&apos;s President spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition,, Nieto&apos;s President promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals was not. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> for Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States-heavy and full of old grievances. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never think about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to abandon half its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> That is why it is worth only any U.S. statesman Statesman word toward Mexico, critics in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that Americans prejudice the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> and the descendants of montezuma Montezuma militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex are Mexico&apos;s relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Do you want to talk about grievances? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom no such opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, DENVER or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history or father or grandfather who has not had the opportunity to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> most Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion,, poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> their descendants, and we remember about this. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made for good work, but we do not forget that even this American, and not the Mexican dream. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> our national self-determination Determination and unclear, but we know what the country considered. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> we answer them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> they see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as As Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We did not speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> our very existence is explained by the failure for them. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not have been now for silk curtain, finding Finding life in the US, but lost a spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> my wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even in childhood, and it reminds me of that friction between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there are certain-Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, is a shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a U.S. citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group los tigres del norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans.... </seg>
<seg id="2192"> and we are called the Mexicans in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship is intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans to Mexican origin working kind of Mexico&apos;s ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her visit, and would urge political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> nothing will come out of it. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> too many of the grievances of the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> and, given the gap between the rich and the poor, the new corruption and the drug trade, many of us does not believe that the country is so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> sorry, but But themselves Themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> and this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If part of the Mexicans still can Can forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in the offence, most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle in the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundation for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> If it is possible to have a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released with Gaza rockets fell in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, capital of Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly mired in his change. &lt;/s&gt; &lt;/S&gt; conflict in the Middle East came </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be interpreted in different ways, but the events of the Arab spring &quot;&quot; in rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis not managed to stay in the side from the vortex, the sector of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> There are reasons, however, giving hope of a way out of this deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War Without Winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the situation gives no cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be executed, the collision occurred this week only strengthened security on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, who came to power in Gaza in 2007, provided that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the incurred loss. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 million residents locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas increasing its popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by more moderate Fatah Movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion, that works for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas grows new influential and rich friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among Muslim countries, with support for Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> &lt;S&gt; the Hamas claim about creating around Israel Islamic Crescent from Lebanon in the north, which is governed by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all power is now more More insurgents overthrow Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where authorities threaten to allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on Israel&apos;s southern border, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where President Muhammad over Morsi&apos;s strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not Not special attention to support Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the contrary, the Muslim Brotherhood Organization, are largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In a future diplomatic Diplomatic Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Hamas was crushed in a military sense. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s &quot;Iron Dome&quot; missile system was its creation and successfully destroyed many of the running costs of Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that about 30 Israelis were killed since 2004 from missiles, issued from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state and protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party-within the framework of the preparations for the January 22 elections-have teamed up with even more violent conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What is the meaning to the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you give in their hands all the power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will start to run from missiles in the direction of Israel, as do their brethren in the Gaza Strip? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps, the supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line victorious; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The fact that Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not very warm feelings for Israel, their internal problems will be a priority. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense part of the budget, more than all of its Arab neighbors, have together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> pragmatism Egyptian President Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign, and could mark the start of changes. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not least, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>

<seg id="2248"> Both sides need external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It remains the only solution, which tirelessly called for rational representatives of both parties, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the creation of two states and concessions Israel territories in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> hope remains, not too impressive in the short term, the hope is that the cease-fire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which it is time to take the decision to cut the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position in order to convince Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, taken in the 1967 borders with the exchange of territories and sharing Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries also must make the effort to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements. </seg>

<seg id="2260"> In Australia, the unified law came into force packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The warnings about the dangers of smoking and disease-affected parts of the body image contrasts are on the damp green boxes, are identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice Australian law came into force that packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products, replacing logos and different types of color design the same box of bleak-olive color with nasty images and images of children affected by the disease parts of the body, whose health undermined their parents&apos; smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> in addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the buckets, introduced Mandatory this Saturday-name brands, which printed the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Federal Government of Australia said that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis of the decision on the results of the research, the benchmark that people, not started smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 have never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is obvious that even very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco company with the help of the packaging,&quot; Health Minister Tanya Tanya explains, referring to the research Research, children, for example, that the Crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that these changes Don Don affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures are already considering, and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market cigarettes, which will be sold cheap and available. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who think it initiated,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone who, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra HA from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd, argues that demand for Silicone cases, where the unpleasant pictures on packaging and kind, rapidly grew up (with almost zero) since two months ago, companies such as British imperial tobacco, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, to which these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers to display cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned local companies and web sites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you sell tobacco products and have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet seem to you extremely attractive,&quot; explains Explains Freeman, news report examined the issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the increase in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites, such as YouTube, twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether it is the hands of the ordinary citizen, which is so cigarettes like Marlboro that did not spare effort and time and made the video, or the advertising campaign is behind this? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of British American Tobacco industry claims that now more preoccupied with adaptation to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relationship with Australia is quite insignificant. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Tanya, the Government has discussed with other countries to make their similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce compulsory, photos, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia has not obey innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures I don Don graze. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don Don pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just Just cigarette and And pack in my pocket,&quot; explains Victor el Hague, buys cigarettes with a photograph of tumors of the oral cavity on the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that could make me stop-and this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the centre of Sydney, argues that the same packaging has been complicated the task of putting products on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before I have the unloading of a new party left an hour, and now four hours,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: What to do, OK, all over, close shop,&quot; he says,, hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world-it is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our aircraft have revealed the mechanical failures and it replaced the other plane, which we were pending. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I have had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> half a day at the airport waiting for a flight-this is really boring, and there&apos;s not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development support in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children not be bored so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that may contribute to the work. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> and since everything we are constantly before some screen in the modern world, the benefits of boredom they pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to aim for boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many others, believed that before boredom-the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have got more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> not so, says Peter Peter, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian university of Calgary, author of the book &quot;The fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact boredom can boast a very ancient history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> This remains an open question as to how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, &quot;says John D.., associate professor at the University of York, in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking question target group in the 100, Professor Professor and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom-is when people &quot;want to, but they can Can do that would bring them the satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, enterprise, he says, lies in the fact that the The man does not do something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The apathy, not want to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The experienced boredom, he says, is a &quot;violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in mood and feeling that time goes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> According to the description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Professor argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions Conditions people see the causes of the problems in the world and depression, circumstances, and people see the problem in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;the unoccupied mind: definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal perspectives on psychological science, Professor Professor colleagues refer to by the earlier experiment, participants who listened to the recording voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the case of TV in the next room, others heard these sounds on low volume, so that they hardly can be dealt with, and the third group listened to voices of only record without any sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, &quot;it was difficult for them to focus more, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, &quot;says Mark J. J., associate professor of neurology at the University of Of, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something Something, &quot;for example,, in the flow of the products in the pipeline for marriage,, music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is, he continues, that when people begin to To on a chair or draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, we now know, however, that in fact such actions not just help relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The study showed that children who did not prohibit fidget and governing, learn and remember more information is better than children, from which require sit tight,&quot; says Professor Professor. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments we all experience boredom: When flight delay (in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, scanning the uninteresting kind of film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people have different levels of propensity to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> in the 1980s for measuring individual researchers developed a &quot;propensity to scale such boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> to determine the assessment on such a scale of questions and statements are used, for example, &quot;much of what I have to do, monotonous and And&quot; or &quot;me too much interesting, so that there are not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that frustrate, enjoy or feel bored boys more than girls, &quot;says Steven Steven, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of various external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are often frustrate, enjoy or feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, personal and social development at the University of Illinois professor, conducted an experiment in which he contacted pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32 percent of teens reported that they get bored in school and homework during the execution, and 23% said that they get bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Only 3% of parents said that they get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said, that he had no information about what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He knows, however, that &quot;Adolescence has the propensity to boredom,&quot; mainly because that children and adolescents do not allow full, than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> back to my original question: Boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> sometimes there is no, because in extreme forms, as research shows, it can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Professor who study this problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us, that you should do something different, and this is boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain doesn Doesn always know what to do better. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you be bored and you direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you&apos;re watching TV, you will be better for some time, and it will soon. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> However, if your child is bored and you give him the The, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way to manage their time and employment, &quot;said Professor Professor. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;and such self-regulatory skills used in the most different situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns by occupy themselves not only something, he also learns self. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that boredom need to praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, regard it as something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> rather, should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of operations and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Professor agree with it. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see this, so that we need more experience boredom, boredom is extremely unpleasant,, desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to disconnect from the constant worries and simply relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world we are accustomed to regular excessive stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when the silence, we go and we do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> While it is unclear how the new law will apply on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, nineteen football team player and student of public college in the south-east of Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, essentially that soon will be quite legitimately on the entire territory of the State: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that once he was with friends in September in In and riding in a car on prairies Prairies when stopped by police near the border. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> after police found marijuana in the machine, Mr. Orozco came agenda in Court for possession of drugs and drug possession of the device for minor offences, for each of which due a $100 fine and set the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated as criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But the criminal he? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the hundreds of minor court cases depends not so much on the law, many from the review. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The charges in the small offences associated with marijuana, already are in the hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already ceased to charge people in 21 years of age and older for the storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in the more conservative districts in Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases associated with marijuana use, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in some cities of the suburbs of Denver to mountain West vote to prevent the emergence of a new state shops licensed to sell marijuana in their places. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is growing so fast that I don Don even know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east from Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the supervisors in Washington also Also озадачено head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will have to create rules for determining the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all you need to do before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues marijuana use for medical purposes, and now first for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;in Colorado, the more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; explains Brian and Smith, the representative of the Council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic products in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now, no one can do more to recognize Mr. Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that this would work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent on which we could focus,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> the Washington State Bill, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging into a state of uncertainty, when there is no system of state licensing, and the right to possession of marijuana but institutionalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> and there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between state regulation of &quot;adequate&quot; access to licensed marijuana prohibition on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It is especially difficult to licensed enterprises on trade in marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group center &quot;the legalization of marijuana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21, the police chief of Oates of Aurora sent out his subordinates by e-mail message that the city prosecutor&apos;s office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to responsibility for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police stop Stop people in these violations &quot;from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Police chief Oates said that Police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals in the city, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Prosecutor Prosecutor County in northern colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said, that the prosecutor&apos;s office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage use of its people undergo treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of less than two and ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of our institutions to pursue for actions that are considered criminal in them,&quot; Mr. buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response was controversial even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> grand junction, the biggest city in the county, police no longer attracted to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The district attorney Pete Pete supported that decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges already open storage cases related to marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that enforce the law until he will not change our duty,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, who participated in the vote, supported this decision on marijuana use for entertainment in public and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> and the reaction of residents in different places of the state&apos;s ambiguity the relations between the local state authorities to experiment with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The District Prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains Shawn Shawn макалистер lawyer representing convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They harassed people for so long that now can Can really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington-the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol-is destined to become experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalization of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the territory of Of trade, but at the same time, they cautiously waiting for instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Justice Department will cede on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons in most cases, the federal government gave welcome on the trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs is unlikely to rush home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become close eyes on regulated by the state shops of the recreational use of marijuana, which are permitted under the new law, &quot;said Kevin Sabet, a former adviser on combating drug trafficking in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores in the sale of marijuana, and so could not open sooner than a year later. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week,,, a city in the western part of the state, has six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved in the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don Don want to be in this position that we supply you with someone, and then license, it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> and now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and voted for that state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There is still a lot of outstanding issues. </seg>

<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> It&apos;s not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied at the private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this renowned cradle Cradle it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Woodrow, was well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You may ask, why to remember about this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, a new generation of students,, center-right views, is the same kind of harassment. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This This and constantly growing hatred of the conservatives in Oxford students is so strong that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as that which is disabled, the sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2597"> It may seem improbable that these lines are part of the advertising loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this-this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying like, &apos;Let&apos;s put Bao (() in the oven &quot;, to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency, which has made this video,, to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the entertainment form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that people wanted to use the power of music to have &quot;their national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world by the continuation of similar, so we felt that it is the theme that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the Government has to do a lot, for example to launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (blitz-visits). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> so we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, and compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Those who do not accept this so lightly, it is the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> it spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens&apos; enthusiasm on the birth of a greater number of children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, prolongs pregnancy and maternity leave, and provide tax relief. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of this has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2-what is known as a percentage of substitution in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of couples and families of the national population policy, says that the reason &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It helped people have a wide range of options in terms of goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms contribute to the increase of the number of young bachelor or Bachelorette and postponement of marriage and the birth of her children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which focuses on a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, where barely concealed xenophobia thrives in many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and the failure to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that growth in the past year, Singapore&apos;s ruling party got the worst result in the elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> after the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the assistance of the quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> At the time, as the falling birth rate has a certain influence on the nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policies, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to not has been so little housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development has to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot;, which you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These 46 square meters of apartments sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote Promote lifestyle and deprive incentive housing developers who want to build a big family. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the firm Firm el developers, says that &quot;shoe box&quot; sold them much faster than the more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flow increase. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledges that new rules give more clear guidelines for developers, who earlier put the tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> too Too </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While the new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after a conversation with With, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very expensive, as well as over-stretched with some 80,000 UN peacekeepers deployed, housing and education, and because of this many people this delay,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> the men and women of the mention of his career, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, no matter how the Government has encouraged citizens to the birth of children, that remains for the family, the last word for For. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> mortality rates from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis of the AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I like Like&quot;, he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of the doctor, at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The hidden it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> having to cope with the disease, he wanted to learn more about it as much as possible. and its efforts to materialize-he has already said his 43-day birth. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; patients of HIV-branch hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be difficult to believe, too few treatment options, too little is known about the disease existed then, were too biased to the sick. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even the Director of the Mexican institute of social protection clinic did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because it was cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those times have AIDS sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and make it, not worsening quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus is already damaged, &quot;&quot; &quot;their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> after 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the patient&apos;s survival, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV Department of HCG, Jaime Jaime Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> &lt;S&gt; and an expert on HIV / AIDS,, Villanueva explained that since 2008, the researchers came to the conclusion, that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with best anticipated life expectancy of those who did not use the drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when 500 reported CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In short, this means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the age of 25, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> to assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from From in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in In 255 people died in 2011, and already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Why do still have a lethal outcome? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;for me personally, it seems, that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> so I should imagine, so the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least we didn Didn have a shortage of medicines in the past 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don Don know about their Their, i.e., the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led the crushing data: &quot;nine out of ten patients come, when already have some Some infection; that we need to do, to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all the people who it will be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal converge in the opinion of experts and officials of the State Council on HIV / AIDS prevention in In ((), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned in a private laboratory to test, only motivated by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Suffered саркомой cancerous tumor, which is one of the more common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that die, and Don Don want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;The Times still die, it is better I&apos;ll&apos;Ll three times a week,&quot; they say, but not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I&apos;m well Well, do exercises, take drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents only know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I am an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, have about themselves and about another person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with Milenio Jalisco, to prompt its statement of those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, is fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let the if If if there was a risk of infection, let know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other man, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> It is his message summarises the theme of the struggle against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
