<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to repeated election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders have justified their policies to combat fraud in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, Brennan Center found last myth, arguing that cases of fraud in the elections in the United States, more rare than deaths from lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides, the Republicans &apos; lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: these new developments will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense these actions partially discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, u.s. States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is why most State Governments since 2009 year adopt laws that complicate the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon was a new scope after the elections in November 2010, the year that brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only one year 2011 was adopted by 180 bills limiting the right to vote in State 41. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of u.s. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, voter registration law legislated in the day and will take away the right to vote of citizens, have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to the 2006 election year no American State is not obliged to seek voters &apos; identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first State to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 2008 year in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During the past two years, they have initiated bills to require voters to present photo identification, in 34 States. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, under the age of 21 million people required to vote do not have photo identification issued by a governmental authority of the State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required identity documents often exceeds one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New constraints disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than $ 35000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old did not have the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that&apos;s not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students-voters who considered voting for candidates from the Democrats in several States are not permitted to use photo ID issued by the educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same States permits members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly Republican, for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no State required proof of u.s. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Starting in 2011, more than a dozen States have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are citizens of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are obviously intended to limit voting by Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Is that two-thirds of Latino voters voted in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have launched in 2011, the laws, revoked the registration of voters on election day in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This limitation did not pass without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election year voter registration drive has helped make lists about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, measures have been taken since the year 2009, led to the fall of the 17% level registration of new voters in 2010 compared to year 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other States have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Thus, during the general elections of 2008, 33% of the electorate in Florida, voters were African American, ahead of schedule, although they accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of the electorate, they accounted for 24% of the citizens who have voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike the whites, who form a 76% of voters, among voters ahead of time was only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, legislators are Democrats and their supporters strongly oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws were vetirovano Governors-Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This allowed partially limit the negative effects. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 States have passed laws requiring a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules, which came into effect, of course, would make it difficult to exercise suffrage in elections 2012 year. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats decry the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing in them an obvious direction to influence the outcome of elections 2012 year in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Brennan Center report from year demonstrating that 2011 States that these laws are 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election year of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense these actions partially discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: a test pass or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives misleading results, lženegativnye and sometimes lžepozitivnye that lead to pointless medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so are reluctant to pass examination, there is something even more doubts. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two experts opinion. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data are difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to make any firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time European, found varying levels of mortality in those patients who were screened and those who were not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also showed that after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis in 30-40% higher among those who are not screened. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend starting with test 50 with 40 years of age, or if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men also are at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is making the right decision as soon as the cancer is found. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive and intensity. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to clarify the risk of cancer by offering him choices, without having to treat prostate cancer that is not harmful to the life in the long term, while making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who have a cancer, will not be treated because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, we precisely define criteria for deciding who should or should not pass a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend to still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool that can help you evaluate the pros and cons of PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (in English, the translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all people would be cool enough and ate 30% of cases, rako. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, this figure would increase to at least 50%,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain totally unexplainable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Cancer Canadian Association for tobacco control remains a priority, despite a decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking linked to 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is causing enormous harm to human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million in Quebec smokers,&quot; said spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging fact: over 10 years after smoking cessation decreases the risk of dying from cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to KAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life, protects against colon cancer,&quot; added to the Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Association also recommends that you limit your intake of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities, it increases the risk of cancers of the large intestine. </seg>
<seg id="93"> You should also avoid sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Canned meat by smoking, salting or drying, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The past can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explain the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years many scientists engaged in research on the influence of vitamin supplements on cancer development. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But so far the results are mixed. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to SCC, vitamin e studies give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed a reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other has the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing the development impact of vitamin D is also unclear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However Mr. Beaulieu stressed that their concerns and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Letting analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer a message that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real stir-and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this explains all of particle mass of boson in the universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model-our better, or at least &quot;least imperfect&quot; describe the nature and behavior of matter, but which had not been detected empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physicists still believe that this is about celebration of the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with really new part and that she strongly resembles a Higgs boson, predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, though to be sure, some data is still lacking. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same that it is a celebration of the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world, there is one law absolutely inevitable that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule, there is no way to even do not try too hard, otherwise harming herself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is one law of this nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which States that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; is a &quot;status&quot; is, in general terms, some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the physics is shared by two classes of particles. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find the good citizens, called fermions, obey the Pauli principle judiciously. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In another infamous, bustling about bosons gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least to this principle, which means that they can easily end up in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> As the website (by the way, is quite unusual) Particle Adventure Lab Berkeley, these bosons are divided in turn into two groups: Mesons, which we will not speak here, and &quot;particles&quot;, which are the basic forces of nature, and which in some way is the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, not all such exotic beings as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this Chronicle, this is thanks to one incredibly boso to something as common as a photon, or: &quot;the particles of light&quot;, which is the &quot;courier&quot; for the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle with an electric charge, speeds up or changes direction, it &quot;violates&quot; the electromagnetic field in this particular location, like a stone thrown in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violation&quot; is born of an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and hence one of the vector bosons &quot;force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same happens with the Higgs boson, the only difference is that in order for this boson has appeared to be &quot;broken&quot; another field, the Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is far, far more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, to achieve very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake the very large rock. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated by CERN, Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! -to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Actually, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will not be grasped on the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (like the photon, BTW) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;could be&quot; all these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science they are used to verify the accuracy of the standard model (SM), and this also enables physicists find the discrepancy between observations and predictions. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, some of them ardently yearn to this discrepancy was found, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The last, say, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80 percent of the universe (uh oh!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN found no difference. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Effects </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies to the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that its not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: at the beginning of the 60 &apos;s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs and might not even expect a revolution cause they work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their application in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where, in 1960, was invented by a laser, and who himself designed the first laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a &quot;Gadget Lab&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine ... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And in addition, the application may be for instrumentation, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during his optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not its original purpose, now serves as an &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the Nobel Prize in physics 2009 year. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This is, of course, does not mean that the work of the large Hadron Collider will definitely will change our lives, but this only shows, in fact, that everything could be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die ... | &quot;Duty&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for dignified death in Quebec was recently discussed the delicate issue of his life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will soon be resumed, while a Bill is in preparation. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this critical area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Duty&quot; tried to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. l. Has lived alone in her apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that ravaged his inside, gave him a two-year reprieve. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived for seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed in a shelter, Victor Gadbua-palliative care in Belœil, arriving the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, you cannot prepare for it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job: the incredible weakness that does not go to the bathroom alone and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at a table on which stands a tasty lunch, he gives up and agrees to help him eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Bodritsâ, he even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, drugs him, lead him to the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in the normal death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest desire is to me cured of diarrhea, it&apos;s humbling,&quot; he acknowledged. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;For the life of us teach that man must urinate standing up,&quot; said Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the orphanage of Victor-Gadbua. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to a State child-for some unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It all depends on the person&apos;s ability to&quot; come to terms with the decline, he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events and slučaâûtsâ in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who enroll in Hospice Palliative Victor-Gadbua, all have cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In this phase, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called &quot;therapeutic&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. a., 89 years old, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to learn of their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good kids,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in life,&quot; she said, before releasing it to facilitate breathing mask. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting for the latest visit in the next few days, his son, who came from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor Gadbua at the shelter with the help of a group of volunteers provide eye care and nutritional assistance. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which remains when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, for every one seat 11700 inhabitants in palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very small, considering that sooner or later we are all going to die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it be physical, emotional or comfort her. </seg>
<seg id="180"> We agree to provide the dying mouth rinses of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks for. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We do not make more diabetics to control blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought beer to Mr. h., who died last night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> In the morning his son drank this beer in the legs late. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are helping the families, as well as patients,&quot; said Natalie Savard, Director of nursing. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At the orphanage, Victor-Gadbua not a single day is similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on their cushions during a toast in his honor, dies tragically young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children and pereprobovašij all to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the past six months, ranging from three to five beds, always busy with cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martel worriedly. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients being taken to a shelter, Victor-Gadbua, coming from the House and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> Is that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some agencies, such as shelters and Victor Gadbua-Society of palliative home care Large Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this big gap in the Quebec health care system makes many specialist physicians in palliative care, fear the law, euthanasia is an application from a certifying and assistance in committing suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Starting in October, signed a manifesto circulating luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfurom and Dr. Bernard Lâpuantom Mount and testifying about their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec&apos;s health care system is not sufficiently effective to ensure the right to quality palliative care before transition to euthanasia is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, &quot;I&apos;ve seen a patient that has spent 14 days in the Emergency Department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary steps to alleviate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I&apos;m afraid that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard already had been minimal when it discontinued the arduous chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I quit treatment, she replied that I regretted that I quit the fight, she says. </seg>
<seg id="201"> She herself said to me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> No withdrawal of the all-powerful </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believed that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanked medical staff for failing to comply with their request, once the team of palliative care relieves their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Note, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in pain control. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monroe, Director of palliative care in the community palliative care at home Much of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to analgesia in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps till the moment of his death, either occasionally or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is no longer possible to pretend that we don&apos;t know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more patients that fail to relieve the pain, can have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always saying the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want to have euthanasia&quot;, it means &quot;I want me to be easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this reportage was made possible by a grant from the Institute of journalistic studies Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for road construction, building contractors, builders of the political parties and the Italian mafia, day by day, tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot; oputyvaûŝej construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and members of the mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;The industry&quot; which has cost taxpayers dearly in Quebec, particularly in 1990 and 2000 respectively. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;Curious how this system is crumbling after having been put in by all means, Jacques Dûšeno, jokes and former Deputy Chief of police of Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him that in 2011, the scandal as a side result of investigation of offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, at which time the Prime Minister of Togo from Liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Dûšeno Report&quot; found a direct relationship between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;With the start of the investigation in the year 2010, he said, the Ministry of transport would save billions of dollars in contracts&quot; if some kept their instincts to take share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission has already shifted &quot;Charbonneau two mayors,&quot; he adds, hoping that it will &quot;expose the schemes behind individual personalities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Continuous anti-corruption unit, established in year 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The year 2011 has created a permanent unit to fight corruption, which has an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, members of the special forces unit of the &quot;hammer&quot;, who, after the 2009 year forced the &quot;cesspool&quot; of Montreal, stop cartel inflated the value of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> During the past few weeks have been a series of searches, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Markottu-the Mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The queue-Gilles Vaillancourt, recently retired from the post of the Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of bribery occurs when placing State orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, the official was indicted several communication engineers and building contractors of Montreal of Italian descent, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> This bomb detonated last having told investigators about the &quot;system&quot; to obtain government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For several years he gave Zambito 3% of the value of contracts signed in Montreal, a mediator that is associated with the mafia, which in turn translated the money the Mayor Gérald Tremblay&apos;s Party &quot;Merged Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000 &apos;s, soril Zambito money right and left. He listed more 88000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68000) different parties of the province, mostly Liberals, who were then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted that he illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts in which the inflating cost </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was trouble-free. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Sûrprenan, a retired engineer in civil engineering, the Commission described it in detail: during the ten years he received from construction companies gifts, invitations, travel to golf tournaments, in restaurants, on ice hockey matches and bribes totalling 736000 dollars in Exchange for sewer contracts, whose value it inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for road construction, confessed that they received on the paw, puts bills to 30-40% using false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one of the Mayor&apos;s Party Organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trembley that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, bright in the party cashier dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members in Montreal, yet disturbing. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The Mayor of Rivière-de-Prèri in the East of the island, it is opposed to the sale of the municipal year 2010 site bought for 5 million dollars and resold for. .. 1.6 million developers at the height of the building boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She said that the investigation that eventually will be launched, it will pull the thread to understand the functioning of the system, teeming with ants to stop gangrene and to identify the guilty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process it harakterezuet as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> While watering our House. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Dûšeno said for his part that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but especially his role bothers &quot;elected officials knew about the scheme, but not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Considering that the percentage of dirty money in campaign finance reaches 70% in Quebec, he jokes: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to $ 100, but, he said, it will not change the situation: &quot;until we are strictly limited to elective politics, spending will be dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete restructuring of the system of granting Government contracts and financing parties: &quot;we can&apos;t drop below; boldly penetrating the essence of things, we can build a House on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and tarnished the international image of Québec and Montréal, Mr. Dûšeno encourages anyone who laughs, look in your own backyard ... </seg>
<seg id="250"> PSG-FC Barcelona! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season you had unusual Paris Saint-Germain. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by individual conscience, but can-and the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I grow every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also contributed. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not raspalâûs′. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning, in the middle of preconditioning in NIF in Klerfontene and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always stepped forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you will benefit from the competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti ... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The replenishment of this summer is not a novelty playing matches of a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know also that each workout is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that such a player like me, and yearns to be placed at the level of the to the Max. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has supported my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is assisted by deputies, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti-master of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspire respect for the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today the first League had no equal, and it is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he has won many titles with high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was an encouraging conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I stray far from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Trust me he is also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of season PARIS SAINT GERMAIN? </seg>
<seg id="279"> Lyon won the first League we have been a leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main goals is the Champions League, we are effectively one-eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the Club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as you can. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We can say in a face to face with very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group, to Porto, to be able to take the second leg in the eighth-finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether PSG become the first-class European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has a budget for this ... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club to win titles Paris, and secure a position for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially by PARIS SAINT GERMAIN have the means to make this project a reality. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Don&apos;t take the first League title last season, will be the biggest failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we really crave to get this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In may, it was frustrating because we had to come to the finish line first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Typically, 79 points is the champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, played a fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think everything will be OK. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title to take such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Don&apos;t you think that the MEDIA are too much from PARIS SAINT GERMAIN? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared for this. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we are winning at home 4-0 against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it&apos;s a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what primarily expect us people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement the project. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We proved that in the Champions League can respond to contemporary challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons fails in one-eighth finals, although they too have spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount you invested, we were on 15 points ahead of the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would be a snub to our opponents and to the Championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, has been &quot;woken&quot; the new PARIS ST GERMAIN. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how fascinating first League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to yourself, that despite all the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&apos;s exploits. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So what if they say that there is a &quot;Zlatanozavisimost′&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibrahimovic was very successful and he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It has come to this, and he proves that he is the star of the first League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and star world. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did was really exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This stimulates the other and improve his game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you survive the Euro-2012 with the France team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> How frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I very much wanted to participate in the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately my injury has prevented me to snatch a bit of game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen many things, and there I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I manage to play good matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I was hoping for since my baptism at blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave in an exemplary manner. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps led Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They have worked for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He had a good position in the qualifying Group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He is a strict coach, he is close with the players, and the inspiration for victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> How was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I wouldn&apos;t like to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc reached its goal, he called us into the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the blue Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Nice deserved a draw (1-1), out October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us faith in yourself. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> The shock in Spain, my career hasn&apos;t been such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of banks with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite to the current monetary exchange, based at centrobankah, numbered transactions between the receiving parties (c) fees fees for processing. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens with these technologies is clear political vision: a belief that the present currency system made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym) is a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, euro ...) and secure Exchange Protocol BitTorrent type, which allows the exchange of files between members of the same level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200000 operations already registered with 15000 PCs on your network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Thousands of websites are bitkojny for donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Bitkojna rate, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $ 2 before returning today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special compared with the worldwide exchange of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, issued in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes bitkojn as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the normal currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as &quot;loans&quot; are used to promote the video game, which are earned during the game or who might buy (and sometimes exchanged). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But always exchange operation monitors and handles any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In Bitkojn all nodes of the network are both holders of ledger, currency issuers, auditors, pokupatelymi and vendors. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users actually occurs between the two e-mail addresses, like email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only payment for every new user can select another address, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Set of information related to the deal, signed electronically, using the dual-key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, you may check that the bitkojny used in the transaction did exist in public accounting book, sent across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A key step is to register a new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through the solution of mathematical problems, sent to computers, decided that, like a temporary Central Bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The file hash phase, i.e. the large file conversion to a digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers are taking &quot;a new transaction and adds her room before the&quot; hashed &quot;all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find a number that will provide a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it correctly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction nerarzryvno is thus associated with chain all other transactions; any modification would change the digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If tricking the user very quickly (in less than 10 minutes) would wish to pay twice by the same money, only one of these two transactions have been confirmed by the network-and the other would have remained unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which task receives 50 bitkojnov. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, regularly award is divided in half, probably before the end of the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitkojnov in the treatment of 21 million is therefore limited, but they are delimy to one stomillionnoj, that leaves a pool of ... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty also increases with increasing computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Life network has already experienced the highs and lows. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites that provide services, Bitcoin attacked, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;You used to not defect of the Protocol itself,&quot; said Pierre Nuaza, who recently started a company making the payments-Paymium real money using Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash also have this drawback. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players, such as Wikipedia, have refused to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, allow them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recent Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed accounts book and discovered that almost 80% of the bitkojnov are not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Huge sale&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty-thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; rejoices John Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in converting bitkojnov into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Nuaza, another author of the manual on that currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses a Bitcoin transactions to verify that this comes out cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Winner of the best control of your personal data and may therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Suffice it to say that you can &quot;take a picture and recognize&quot; telephone, said Pierre Nuaza, assuring that there are already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend review of hierarchical systems towards more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before, there will be a Bitcoin awhile but 2013 year could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> In its report, the ECB suggests, by the way, review a variety of risks considered to be high today, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We were gone from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What&apos;s next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left its area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of the 2014 season. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to decide their future, not relying just on us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We were mostly Afghan farmers, which we viewed as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with 88 killed by soldiers, and wounded and disabled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasant farmers, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as was the case in the USSR. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They suffer, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer be as soon as the West becomes more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Withdrawal of French troops from the bases of Nijrab route, which I watched from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees with French credit, passed in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters have reached Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, the Taliban invasion on Kabul will not. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their irresistible promotion with the year 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> While Kabul was deserted, the country was in fire and blood, due to fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> They take control of the country back then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women paid dearly for these farmers, obscurantism, in which Al-Qaida has surpassed them, but their situation has not improved in our days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, Taliban and Afghan Government are United in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war, returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They became dealers, exciting public land to resell their land to returnees who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They&apos;re discredited; most of them, by the way, not even fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Folks, as I heard in the countryside, want a Government that would be not from thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as the ones who managed to leave the American generosity: capital outflows. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul there are now 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in the cities, filled with both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> You must provide jobs for those young people who do not want to go back to old batches of obscurantism, corruption by some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including armed militants, like mobile telephones, television and Turkish soap operas that are the modern world, and that look is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment the army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities, who will command it, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Old commanders, pointing to the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore the provincial brigades who would not submit to central authority. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent modelled on Western Nations, but the United States wants to turn it into a centralized State with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before elections scheduled for April 2014 years. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country, starting from the 50 &apos;s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industry was not put back on its feet, no dam does not function, no irrigation system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, in addition to vegetables and fruit. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, Government control of infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> It was rumoured that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This only heightened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to get hold of them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transport to be exported through the mountains, no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese are already almost left mine copper Aiynak Mo, leaving international archaeologists (funded by World Bank) unearth huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan equally, which largely depend on import and export, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Withdrawal of French combat units was completed on November 20. </seg>
<seg id="444"> New co-operation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, Faculty of French language at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> The year 2009 in a bid to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and perform the impossible task of combining assistance with offensives, &quot;military-civilian activities&quot; of the Ministry of defence (Cimic), abolished in the year 2012, along with a small French public organization, public works and contributed to numerous activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, with intense involvement of the local workforce, could help stem the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing the area of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> That we leave the memory of himself, spending two billion euros to military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget considering the improvement of the living conditions of the local population is very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of over 2000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy received dozens of written requests relating to the implementation of small-scale agricultural work deriving from the local community in Kapisa province. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, which want farmers, as they told me, you need to provide them with a small non-military support, which would be well controlled and would come to them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Heavy deliveries of the Egyptian Constitution </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a risky move President Mohamed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever on the question of the Constitutional Declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play. </seg>
<seg id="454"> All posts by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly will vote on the final text of the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Exactly a week ago, the head of State gave the collection of two extra months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Soon the past two years, as Egypt relies on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal controversy. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative is only reinforced the Division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> According to its opponents, the President persists in its &quot;avtokratičeskom&quot; delirious &quot;by continuing to violate this word&quot; and &quot;to flout the law. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In the camp of his followers believe that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Referendum must be held within fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which causes the Brothers to abandon the intention attributed to the Egyptians article text for the article. </seg>
<seg id="462"> It&apos;s also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi, seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> So much so that the call for accelerated voting like the Egyptian people an ultimatum: &quot;either you vote for my text, or I leave himself emergency powers, which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted today for the text. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals had not responded to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they popped the door, feeling unable to deliver an opinion. </seg>

<seg id="723"> Through work at the McDonald&apos;s box office is up to a quarter of all American adolescents </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days across America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores Walmart Corporation and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald &apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendys, and &quot;Kentucky Fried chicken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one is predicting, turn this wave in the ninth wave or it is destined to Peter out in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares of a number of left-wing trade unions and support social organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to raising wages that get a modest rank and file employees of Walmart and fast food systems, to the organizers of the protests is the establishment of trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> While this sector is almost not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Stocks began last week, after the Thanksgiving holiday, the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when America struck orgy giveaways, which seized millions of inhabitants and is sometimes accompanied by the issue was discussed at. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of Walmart, which worldwide employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed along with labor unions and left-wing activists stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest or moderate means. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many low-paid workers, the workers have only a Walmart at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods podeševke partly because little is paying its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The last also complain of harsh working conditions, such as a shortage of forklifts or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The shares in &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, with up to 30 jumped 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Typical Walmart employee receiving 9.5 dollars per hour, does not afford this expense, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart would increase salaries to srednuûû 12 dollars an hour, it will cost the Corporation in 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart wages growth pereložit entirely on the shoulders of customers, each visit to the store will cost them a total of 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For a year they will spend on some 12.39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart rather note that the protest took place only nine States and caused no damage to the malejŝego Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8:0 pm on Thursday until midnight of the following day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash registers produced in &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Corporation Representative Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the Huffington Post site left that jobs had left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart and that the protest was simply &quot;another public stunt&quot; who had arranged her Trade Union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where their targets were not department stores Walmart (they are in this progressive city are complaining and therefore here yet) and &quot;Makdonaldsy&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that it sells billions of servings, and then he didn&apos;t even give you hospital and does not pay you for an honest job! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Džumejn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently the minimum wage under federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants, over time, it increases, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file employees receive in New York $ 8.90 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than them in this ritzy City does not earn one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can you be in New York for that kind of money, it is incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through the &quot;Makdonaldsy&quot; was almost a quarter of u.s. teens who moonlighted as the counters after school while living with his parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw this main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I&apos;m constantly we at interviews with staff &quot;Makdonaldsov&quot; who complain that should live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the online newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author of the comment hangs notices that irresponsible to have children, if you are know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants of the protest action, which began at 6.30 am on Thursday the &quot;McDonald &apos;s&quot; in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast food systems began to pay at least $ 15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast-food sector have established trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the Administration that hinder and punish the activists of the trade union movement quibbling and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the Administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But the Trade Union reach is hard and fast food for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the incredible turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The Dissenting </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests were held on that day and a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination was the rally in the mid-afternoon rally near &quot;McDonald &apos;s&quot; near Times Square, featuring several local politicians, particularly Democrats, City Council Member, Džumejn Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald &apos;s,&quot; says he sells billions of servings, and then he didn&apos;t even give you hospital and does not pay you for an honest job! &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the candidate for the post of Mayor Bill De Blacio, who said that &quot;we must join together in support of fast-food workers, so that they have achieved pay equity and economic well-being, which deserves every new-jorkec!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described on the New York Times, it was the largest rally of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food service, which in New York are employed tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is unclear whether this would spark the flames of mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as mid brain is deceiving&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology on augmented reality lately taken taken mainly through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First summer at its annual Conference, the current model showed the Google, and then in November it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from a conversation with the team leader, interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft lab, Cambridge Šaramom Izadi, that for academics the glasses-passed. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Their enticing prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual open space. </seg>
<seg id="778"> -Please tell us in general terms, what does your study group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> -We are human interactions with machines, but are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While humanity has gotten stuck in the mass of the stage work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes tykan′â them with your finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to take a peek at the 5-10 years ahead and foresee fundamental changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, Xbox and Kinect sensor is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox Kinect sold today, after all everyone is interested žestovoe. </seg>
<seg id="783"> -That still lies ahead of us? </seg>
<seg id="784"> -Despite the fact that the Kinect postponed interaction at the physical level, many things still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Improved input (the system gets more data), and the output is not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, working on a true three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Be released in our computer world, physical, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To do so, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complement real world virtual objects in a much more user-friendly format. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place-to hell with these wacky virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> -What about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but don&apos;t overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> -Its definitely not a panacea-the question of privacy, because not always want to notify others of your actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in your niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought over gestures, but not over the sweeping, and over such poor, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not camera device and line bracelet, which fixed the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> As long as it is big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> The future is mixed but generally the type of control, for example, voice + gesture. </seg>
<seg id="799"> -It&apos;s like? </seg>
<seg id="800"> -For example, as you ask me to send you this jar soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> -I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> -Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> -So, you want to force users to adapt to something that may or may not at this time machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> -It is not necessary, but it&apos;s a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think soon we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will more precisely define the human reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This can be, for example, laser sensors, they give good depth resolution is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> -If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, which you claim to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Not enough permissions, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> -In principle, this generation is something from which we can build in our work on three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get the 8 Megapixels at a speed of 1000 FPS. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not a matter of megapixels and as matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> The latest terms of all current technologies are not good enough for us-this adds the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> We have to remember that is not only about the resolution of X and Y and Z, but. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is quite dynamic, and current to 30/c frankly not enough, particularly for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Betišes of our Rèdmondskoj laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable delay of 1-handling up to 100 MS, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, not only requires the touches that I wish there were more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> -Increase the number of cameras and don&apos;t need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> -In Kinect now has three &quot;camera&quot;, one of which actually is the infrared lamp, and a second signal receiver. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And here is the third camera is actually the normal visible range sensor. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem ... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect play with curved arrangement of cameras and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> -As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, are not presented to the public their glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that in terms of everyday use of technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> -Of course, all the while holding the Smartphone roam raised hands, is not very convenient, but that&apos;s what I think: the coolest option would be &quot;passing&quot; augmented reality when a cloud-based platform you could switch from points on the Smartphone, a projection screen, and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Glasses-very personal device, their strength (private things that only you can see), and at the same time weakness-based augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> -Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual objects in the air golografičeskimi is not only Tony Stark from an Ironman, but mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem that is often pointed criticism of such an idea: there is no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepares for the challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In his lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh time a breakthrough in interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could well become additive tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks-using second hand as a substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It registers a hit! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that really focused on making this &quot;pictures in the air&quot;-for example, tangibility interference more targeted ultrasonic rays at a specific point where the finger, gives the feeling, but it is very weak-as if you blew on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bracelets on the wrists, that affect the nerves in your fingers is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> -Have you tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him think that he feels like that must feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> -This is a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another challenge, which is to go on for a long time-how to make a person physically in very limited space, believe he is on open, almost infinite – are working on concepts and treadmills (no such as clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While fooling the brain turns out medium, work still very many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers-many things in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Vkusovŝina instead of culture-Rosbalt. </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; devoted citizens, who are ahead in the forefront of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In the top-list already got bright figures of the art scene of Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding acceptance in Europe, bypassing won national notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="850"> New hero &quot;Rosbalt&quot;-a scandalous artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller-bearded man, dressed in all red, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the trendy hangouts and vernissages. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Cyril Miller&apos;s paintings always gather crowds wherever they were. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Cyril Miller-one of a purely Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of the new mythology. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Cyril Miller is a striking man of the Petersburg avant-garde late 80 &apos;s-early 90 &apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile, raising all the townsfolk mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took up an organ grinder and became St. Petersburg šarmanŝikom, as ripe for this challenging role for all its Bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> -Chris, why do you still go through the city in the red, not yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> -I chose red as a fashion designer, and view the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world the color red is a compromise between the artist and society of image-makers. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society that barely gray, causes aggression and excitement of an unkind properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocation intended to start conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole story of my acts of provocation-an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> -When did you realized that to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> -Exhibition at the Nevsky PALACE, where were exhibited my works. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then wave the old free informal painters was held, and the new, free like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with postgazonevŝinoj, which led to the &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and more waves. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I throw in a theater, clothing, music, all genres except words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it all came together in your art clinic ...-it was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, which should meet all the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there has not yet been repaired, there was a musical and artistical Club, Bohemian Club, the St. Petersburg home of Bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noma, Tequila-jazz, remember how Cord led with &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s ear&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a obtâgivaûŝem tights fashion, among them was the composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band started playing live, it has become the &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was leading many to Hali-galivskih times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and went to his great career and basic education and the education he received there. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;d 137&quot;, Club &quot;Griboedov are echoes of art clinics. </seg>
<seg id="877"> To our employees and regulars are gone. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I&apos;m the hero of yesterday&apos;s century when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000 the survey was in press, the award was &quot;the People of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;artist of the year&quot; was named after I ended my climax. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times of the old rules work man, I am uncomfortable truth, honesty and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our days it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> -Your work has a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> -Many of my paintings are hits, they pronounced the relevance and severity. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have a software exhibition, &quot;Russian Museum in the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns-timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used to be social, be was now is hurt and scared. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But my clowns all smeared, tragedy is eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love Grotesk, I have a grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, saving the world by totalitarian ordered dressing. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Meet on odezhke now focusing on external mechanics, not the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And maybe his hand in the face and not to spit. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be filmed using changing rooms. </seg>
<seg id="894"> -And recently we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. -Cultural city has to have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, like me, not them. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Mr. may and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> -Commercial art Now should be neat, considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Is the disintegration of the crops. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Earlier people floundered in flocks, La Boheme, one loved, who are unsophisticated. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now, all divided into mikrosoobŝestva, it&apos;s hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I&apos;m not a $ 100 a piece of paper to all please. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you need to think, to whom will you please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now every cult hero to 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> -Stasa Mihajlova comes by a few thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> -Come on brošenki, there&apos;s sex-social sphere is triggered. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But on cultural grounds 300 people will come, and the 10th. will not come, and in the end less management, money, all dying. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, don&apos;t cheat, don&apos;t spoil acquired. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I wrote such pictures that one collector, they are on the wall next to Falk and Larionov were hanging. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confused concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Talk: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, this is from another Opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a person of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am here for such a culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> -Kirill, something lacking in Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> -Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing: an official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not every one of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the correct Kings was all wrong, the Kings could not really understand the culture, but they understood that you want to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here are some good consultants now in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they zadvinuty, because the higher need experts who will assess correctly these experts and give way to them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now a thriving vkusovŝinka. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Saint, what distinguishes them is that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we have, there are artists who must look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> -What is for you-Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> St. Petersburg-this is not the cultural capital, Moscow culture much more soil there is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones art grow hard. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> That&apos;s a lot of people in Europe are very curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art as it was early last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is implemented given a grant of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spaceships with earthlings aboard are sent in search of an alternate world. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save the mankind, the question arises how to continue their family line in weightlessness or appears in the same spare the planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets that you can absorb at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;This is Venus and Mars,&quot; said Senior researcher, State Astronomical Institute named after P.k. Sternberg (SAI) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if conditions on Mars more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus-500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitude or in orbit of Venus ... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Even half a century ago have held experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit was no different from their terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then down to orbit the tiny insects, fruit flies and fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 year in space sent the egg quails to check how the embryo develops in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get the output completely normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And here begins the problem further. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that this chick must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and begin to move,&quot; explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) of the RAS Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, chicks are randomly kuvyrkalis′. </seg>
<seg id="951"> But through 10:0 in newborns was complete atrophy of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks don&apos;t react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there&apos;s trouble was that after four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice we vyluplâli chicks, then abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work there with them,&quot; notes the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Animal cruelty last biological &quot;minikovčeg&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But Bion biosputnike will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there have not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just a biosputnikah, but again-this is an experiment, and such studies should be conducted,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But the breeding approach the problem directly in the space until it turns out. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, familiar environment, just can&apos;t realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Same person, unlike animals, may in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and being able to create a fitting emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons, such experiments are not held. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women in the space of 50 years already fly. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was at Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious that humanity has, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Seagull flew away and no one on earth could not say whether he, after space flight. </seg>
<seg id="972"> She will give birth to a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;In fact on this issue no one answered,&quot; said the veteran of space-rocket industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova rodila dochku. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father was also a cosmonaut ANDRIAN Nikolayev. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second female Cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice visited the home and even in the open space, a son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have a few units there are astronauts who have everything worked out after long flights, and growing healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, then it is dangerous even for orbital flights,&quot; sums up pilot-cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Nevertheless, mankind must find some new way in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The neutral buoyancy laboratory LRC-binding phase of the training for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in conditions of zero buoyancy skills train astronauts in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If water for adults, albeit comfortable, but it&apos;s still a hostile environment for infants-native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Little bear-neverending victory parade if life on dry land emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between what the kid is about 9 months from my mother in okoplodnoj fluid, it is easier to get used to drink afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is just 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It&apos;s very little to forget something,&quot; said instructor grudničkovogo sailing Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the child more natural state of weightlessness, the need for gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quick dry zero gravity in the stomach muscles, the pelvis drops, the ability for peripheries of the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, suppose and are relying on stimulants generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, the Special Chamber go for childbirth, it will bump it up. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot;-sets the non-trivial matters Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not feeling the Earth&apos;s gravity, the body does not produce the muscular system and skeleton. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Newborn in orbit is not possible, as an adult, put a special costume for your workouts. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It just would be deprived of what he will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, we will go with you, with the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we&apos;ll bring to Earth a completely human, dezadaptirovannogo, head of the Bioethics Committee anticipates the IMBP RAS Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space-the question of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after a while it will be a reality when earthlings will travel on their ships to the distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of the main control and revision Office: checking system failed-Schwartz by politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement monitoring agencies Czech Republic is well and, despite the presence of high-quality legislation is falling behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are short,&quot; commented on the current situation of feces. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> These findings provide the joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practice lead Peter Nečasa approach to the so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) won&apos;t bother entrepreneurs-checks comes out is prevented or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be established in any way, and if it is something prohibited, then the Prime Minister could not resist the institutions, which are obliged to check and enforce obligations,&quot; said Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a collaborative project between Czech and German parties, which were mapped to the public procurement law of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> As explicitly described? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> A side-by-side test, which we started, probably, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, a point that European legislation States how public procurement should be followed by national legislation, and then also apply in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All information has been gathered and, even if still unfinished, there were interesting differences-in simple terms, the legislation we have can be &quot;precise and error-free&quot;, but in practice we are in some ways worse than Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules should focus on the application of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And actually as this project can help you what it means to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> This joint control can contribute to efforts to stop refining and perfecting laws, reducing restrictions, because it does not lead to any positive result. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means getting the stuff for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps it will be filled with &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them far easier than if the limit is not reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the internal problems of the practical application of the law on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> And control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There exists an organization such as ours Kru (the Audit Bureau) or does it work differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards the institutions, as our CRU is the Bundesrechnungshof hosted in our principle, also there is a bench that runs a bit differently but basically both agencies operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of the Federal States-in that their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH could only manage federal money, we have the public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public foundations in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal counting Chamber. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With respect to local legislation, there is easier than us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In General, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can take as a model, but you can&apos;t definitely say that it is better all around. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so because they cope better with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I don&apos;t like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it must be said that even the exemplary countries are faced with many challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our Office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In terms of domestic legislation, the impact on your institution as amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal effect of these amendments is rather short, it is not yet reflected in our works. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Because we have control over, you must consider some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take this into account in preparing future checks-we started using our new tool &quot;detection risk neèkonomnosti&quot;, through which we almost drove away the 14000 Government contracts. We have analyzed them. There is, of course, these changes will occur, because the restrictions are changed, modifies the conditions for some types of tenders, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> As you consider adoption of this law will benefit or additional load on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this Act is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> A problem that may occur is that the rules &quot;result in tougher&quot; and cannot be observed. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> The operation of the previous rules ventures tied to the supplier (for example, regional operational programmes-with the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In such a case is whether to tighten the law this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to steal and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error, not influencing the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us realize that this path leads nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that GDP would not bother business inspections of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwarz-system&quot; is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be established in any way, and if it is something prohibited, then the Prime Minister could not resist the organs, which are obliged to monitor and enforce commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say &quot;we change the law and let it&quot;, but you cannot say that we will pretend that nothing is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement has pretty strict rules like that should be conducted formally, and rightly so. This will protect the public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it&apos;s tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only due to formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are short. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Czech roads in some places frozen and snow covered. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think of that, less than a month must come the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily popadaemsâ. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> However, The Tap Tap, we always joke about it and say that we are the only group in the world to be able to gather enough positive energy to postpone or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in December you are going to give absolute unique three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Could you elaborate on that readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is about the national fundraising event, which we are planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which ends on December 21 announced in 11:10. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before the event, on December 20 in 21:00 parallel starting three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will, roughly speaking, when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone on 12:0 before we finished the may calendar. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially, it was my idea, then we all came up together with our artist Gonzoj Bestowed. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, but we also want the public to reflect on the State of the world we pass on to our children one day. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the may calendar we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original vs unknown intercommunications of the end of the world. These things you can buy on the site www.e-tap.cz, and thereby at the same time to support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The Tap Tap together with other musicians also performed the anthem vs doomsday called doomsday has been cancelled &quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1126"> How did you start working with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also collaborate with other persons of the Czech cultural life, because we do a lot of charity events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Tried to connect them to these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested in. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> The proceeds from the concert will go to the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the purchase of equipment for barrier-free education center STUDEO, now in its sixth year, we are working with the Civil Association Edlički Tap in the Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly attend school Edlički Institute students and hold them funny and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we are trying so give them that opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> The additional construction Institute Edlički in the future there will be separate building in which we move from this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Every show will perform several musical groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What were the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will Support Lesbiens, Chinaski, with Dan Barta Illustratosphere, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> All the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you plan any such &quot;great event&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> For the first time in May will speak at the Prague Spring Festival, and of course, we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would love to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are going in the United States, it wished to speak in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you have serious plans, you have spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with in terms of organization and logistics? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five players on their electric wheelchairs, strollers must travel in the baggage compartment, plus a large quantity of cargo and boxes of tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, while this can cope without problems. ČSA Czech Airlines British Airways and British Airways have always been excellent for us prepared, that I was surprised by how many times. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, London, Luxembourg and other countries, where everything works better than here in Russia, we have seen in the East is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In comparison with Prague in Moscow so many barriers, and there still is an amazing human movement on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also there&apos;s not such a trivial thing as to give way to a disabled person in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are community organizations that try to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced country? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are so many things, the level of performance that far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that improvements and improvements has always depended on the efforts of those concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is quite normal that people with severe disabilities to move around on the streets, could go to the bathroom, to the Museum, so wherever you go ... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not very common that large numbers of people with disabilities to participate actively in public life, in that we have them with The Tap Tap a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public or bezbar′ernost′ is one thing, but when we appear famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really will begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> While this single cases of people with strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap is very popular now, but go back to two years ago, in 1998, you made it to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I enrolled in the Institute as instructor, Edlički around me had a lot of young people who wanted something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician and I play the saxophone, along with colleague arranged for an interesting music. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and over time, as our lead Ladâ Angelovic, is a bit out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I&apos;m confusing something? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It&apos;s true, we helped that we have begun to join the famous singers and to work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, as if in fact does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the European Union we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Whether your goal was as good to untwist The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, mimics one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, everything new is made with care, and lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression a person who sees us, of course, it is a pity, of course ... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not suffering from any and all persons, abandoned we should feel sorry for. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who may live a full life and evolve, of course, only if they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities have something turns out, this shift is not only for them but also for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Whether the success of what you are, how strong you feel head of many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I believe that this is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, attending training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly losing enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently in the band The Tap Tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many were there at the beginning of the year in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ladâ Angelovic. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open Group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 19 January 2011 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will be held at the stadium in Prague Incheba, Club Fléda Brno and Ostrava-Plynojem in the Center, with the participation of 12 teams and fourteen other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telemostom at the time of execution of The Tap Tap song &quot;end of the world is canceled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of equipment for barrier-free multi-purpose Education Center at the Institute of Edlički STUDEO in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Concert ticket costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free entrance. You can buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland adopted the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of ESA, September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and over the years has actively participated in several projects of the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to space began much earlier than Poland. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the second world war Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, the lectures of a. Šternfel′da, who represented the year December 6, 1933 in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory of ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to space&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only the doctor Jan Gadomskij was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> The year 1934 in France won the Robert Sternfeld Hesnault-Pel′tri and Andre Luis Hirsch for &quot;Introduction to space&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Ian Gadomskij (1899-1966), referred to above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskij became famous worldwide promoter of space exploration, and his contribution has been estimated including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 in Poland was built a rail trolley equipped with rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea was left unknown, as are the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear, even for acceleration or braking carts had to be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> This trolley is known only from the press of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to wonder about rocket strelah. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> A study carried out with the cooperation of the armament Section technology with professors Mečislavom Vol′fke and Gustav Mokžickim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the surviving material shows that the study reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In the year 1937 in the specialized print Launcher idea photovoltaic fighter proposed by engineer Rohozynsky, and the following year was the work of &quot;Aerial rocket-torpedo and aerial rocket-bomb&quot; author Lelivy-Kživoblockogo. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the last war all military use of rocket technology has been the interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Naukowy Doradczo-Polish), who coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in the year 1937, but after two years of work, the job ended due to the outbreak of war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The following scientific work devoted to Astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the journal of the year 1954 &quot;problems&quot; which are published four voluminous article on Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> One of them, Professor m. Subotovič proposed the Organization of a society that would address space. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, has already gained momentum and the drafts of artificial satellites, it was clear that space research is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of the year 1956 Polish society of Astronautics (AEP) has tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the fall it became a full member of the AEP. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the following year the first Chairman of AEP, Kazimierz Zarankevič (1902-1959) became the Deputy President of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which occurred in the year 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956 onwards, AEP has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish missile, has made a scientific study. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type is RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, which is capable of overcoming the distance 1800 meters, was a length of about 80 cm and its weight less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built an improved version of the RM-1 (a), and in the summer of 1959 year vacant lot on Bledovskom tests were carried out a two-stage missile RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This missile has a length of about 1.4 m and its weight was approx. 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a position to present scientific work-missile RM-34 14.5 km to overcome, and her job was to monitor high-altitude wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, further development was halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rocket launch has become a Meteor type RM-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three types were developed (designated as the Meteor-1A,-1B and-1 c), which differed in size camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Launch of Meteor-1A had a volume of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B-0.34 l, and the Meteor-1 c-62l, 0. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Maximum distance from all three types was 37 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between the years 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute was development of the Meteor-2, and his first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 rocket with the starting weight 380 kg was able to pull weight 10 kg payload to an altitude of about 60 miles. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions were built by Meteor-Meteor-2 h, and 3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth to mention the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee on space research) in 1960, and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, the programme Intercosmos, Poland has participated in studies of outer space for the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germaševskij interkosmonavtom became the second after Vladimir Remeka. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Abrogation of the law on public works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court invalidated the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The ruling provoked a lively debate in the society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, irregular economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence this means that individual economic units national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is due to the principle of free trade and free movement is restricted private capital together with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of significant differences in labor costs (wages) is the price. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept you need to understand the condition, when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods to withstand the economic competition &quot;was&quot; the price of a competitor to pick up a large part of the market and thus increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad or disappearance. As a result of increased unemployment in those countries where the cost of labour, compared with other high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital has no social responsibility, including unemployment, they produced the inevitable expenditures are increasing social spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In General, the situation reinforces the reluctance of gentlemen businessmen pay taxes and thus compensate for public economic and social damage done by them in pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Intrusive methods of private capital are at the level of the economies of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the Government gave its own population to the mercy of private capital, in spite of social decay. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected above all in the revisions of existing legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Goal is to economically make your people to obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to cut employees &apos; rights in the field of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of increased levels of poverty, and the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For several years in GERMANY there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves own labour. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people is approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy continually occur when employed people get such a salary, that the State must pay extra to receive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all southern States the EU will undoubtedly result in the same State in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in social status, or forced to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or exist on meagre salaries on the margins of society, in the hope that someday will come to the country&apos;s private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But the question is, where does he fit? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or it won&apos;t come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media ad nauseam argue that a State may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private equity is stubbornly insisting that the State should not interfere in the actions of the managers of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Next, answer the question as to whether private capital are now virtually controlling politics and so the whole State in own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The clear answer is Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Proof of existence is virtually ubiquitous and powerful lobby in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have an intolerable situation, as manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserves punishment, but not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In GERMANY the situation is such that Government departments because of lack of funds entrusted to develop bills to private law firms that are tightly linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then the Bundestag approves those bills. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes from the people, not as a Western-style Constitution, but from powerful financial groups seeking their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the Liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described by Appian in the novel &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;the State has a long history of splits, and departments are involved in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegitimate favors retrieval by using stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption have flourished without any inhibitions, and people walked to the elections with advance voice &quot;sold&quot; ...no decent people ran for the post of Governor, after all, once the State eight months no Consul. &quot;. .. &quot;Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this horrible situation is autocracy and choosing a vigorous man.&quot;. Appian thought it would be but it was Pompey Caesar, who eventually succeeded democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in contemporary society dominated by their own reckless interests without regard for the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private equity is inherently not intended for public use. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The present result is different from the past: the unprecedented decline of elites without any efforts to reform a deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> It means the cause of the fascist and Communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless liberal economic systems 19 and 20 centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be understood as a pause, after which it is expected the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly tragic is that the current elite is completely ignores the impact on hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, human and social catastrophe that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of the old and the new. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Abrogation of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and at the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social standards of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus the trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The decision targets are political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the State in the economy, will strengthen the role of citizens in Government and would undermine the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: chaos Laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will come out of the violence, and could never get out&quot; – Sting, the song &quot;Fragile&quot;, where the main verse means are the words: &quot;don&apos;t forget what we&apos;re fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons don&apos;t like wars, there were no&quot;-the dying Gutel Šnaper, wife Meera Amšela Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, had a lot of feedback. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to defend itself, and that Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing the Israeli State racism, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist State. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate about who in these recurrent waves of killings-a criminal but a victim who, after all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not to have seen the start of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, a look at who are first and foremost a continuing tension already 95 years (counting from signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917 year) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of recent history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Human history is the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can find the same Alexander the great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people are completely on their own have made their moves, or for their throne stood someone who had directed them to the targeted goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> You should assume that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and power stemming from them could not happen during the life of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically rich family is one that could be considered as head of the Octopus (do not know whether someone above them, but that is not excluded)-the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much to write about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of Course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first News Agency (Reuters) they purchased in the 90 &apos;s of 19 century to stop the rumours linking their name to criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shade of which they lived and that always led to the strengthening of their authorities, accumulation of wealth, or simultaneously, and to another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large blocks of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (prior to the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, following the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries, after the overthrow of Kadhafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian Government took charge of the Central Bank of the country in their hands). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the Central Bank of Rotšil′dovskim Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (see-Government) money and was assassinated in 1865, at Theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John f. Kennedy began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. MP Louis Mcfadden was poisoned in 1936 year after wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their lust for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 year plan led to the development of three world wars created great level 33 Freemason Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first objective of the war was the destruction of monarchical States in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially in the UK, and the third is to reduce the world population to approximately 0.5 billion -1. people (the number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they won&apos;t consume a lot of resources), to create one universal religions (ecumenism can not be anything other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and eventual seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the Working Group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao – order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are always false and lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, resulting in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Imperial Russia by Bolshevik revolûciiû. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> World War I ended the sudden, unjustified in military and economic terms, the surrender of Germany (no longer had need of war for the destruction Tsarist Russia), and as a result was fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To ease the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations on Germany and created a background to the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only to throw the Germans sufficiently strong, convicting the guilty and offering simple solutions leader, went on to create a multinational with a strong German minority in Czechoslovakia, which was to play, and really played a fifth column, while fuelling the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds provoked the founding Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the field of historical Judaism with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration has created preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, started to occur the first clash with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler, broke free of his chains, in which originally held the bankers, or whatever he did, it was planned that in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish State in the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as war reparations Germany was triggered by the 2nd world war, the State of Israel was declared, third to create a hotbed of war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will be able to unleash, the Jewish people, as in World War II, is a victim of the fighting on the front lines, this time together with Arabic or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only domestically but also internationally (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame and who is a victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where insult begets insult in an endless chain of violence if it started with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers to less informed people to vote in elections exclusively their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, a Hawk is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, making all to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...), will threaten to escalate into world conflict, and given control of Iran over Ormuzskim Strait, containing 20% of the world&apos;s oil reserves (a navigable corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what are now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;all we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order, in their view, is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world where the rest of the human population is concentrated in the financial aristocracy, enjoy the comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world where everyone is born to an organism at birth the chip implants, with whom he becomes under total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And makes all the big and small, rich and poor, free and slave have on his right hand or on his forehead, so that the stigma of a man who is not marked, the name of the beast or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> That&apos;s the wisdom: anyone who has the mind, can calculate the number of the beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;operation ARGO: worse than ever, call the Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, the crowd of Islamist students captured the United States Embassy, demonstrators in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in Exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been a patron of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> Positive outcome for the administration of the United States situation not intended-she could not afford to throw overboard the Shah, because it is fundamentally allied to undermine confidence in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by failure to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The prisoners were finally released the diplomats after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity at home and antiiranskih moods. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Srežessirovannyj film actor Ben Affleck &apos; operation ARGO describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America&apos;s small victories. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After the complex twists and turns they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities were able to take them away from Iran, and helped cover the extravagant legend, according to which they left on Canadian passports, as members of the film crew, from podyskivavšie place for filming sci-fi epics. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the &quot;evacuation&quot; expert Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> That legend was accurate, in specialized magazines wrote about the film arranged press conference, a fictional manufacturing company has a real Office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so called &quot;movie-kinoopus&quot;, the story of a successful, scam-an example might be a series of films about Ocean friends. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The film constantly changing moods-on the one hand, the documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in the credits showing iconic historical photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film there is no major difference). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood clips, intersecting with irony and a mild exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene of CIA headquarters and other agencies-men in suits discussing the situation at the table of negotiations, on the stairs, on the phone ... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleku great managed to make a career restart. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From vysmeânnogo the actor became a respected Director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;Operation&quot; ARGO &quot;, his third feature film, after the dark detective&quot; proschaj, detka, proschaj &quot;(2007) and the thriller&quot; the town &quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, this is the first movie that Affleck is not cleared in the hometown of filmmaker-Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> A sense of atmosphere, the place refers to the qualities which were earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck is embodied in the &quot;ARGO&quot;, where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the movie occur in the streets, when reconstruction of real events-the opening scene of the Embassy drop impress with their clarity, which also transmits emotion and confusion the unforeseeability, which occur when something suddenly changed history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues reach the scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at the Tehran Bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The Director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply many exciting scenes of cinematic value. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is quite successfully operating with this a little, sometimes something easy-there&apos;s all this goes not so elegant (a scene in which a phone call from an emerging crisis in America at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on runway look pretty far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> ARGO is a lack of concentration, associated with the need to show too many events into too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would have deserved a larger space, and they&apos;re in the movie is far from the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Affleck lacks a bit of drama, this is a movie that can be watched with mild interest, evaluating performance and retro-style thriller recreating the seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But it hardly captures. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is sufficient for a reminder, still in a sense of living history, and also for evidence of how exaggerated perceptions of the powerful and vseznaûŝih resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules inflate balloons, banana and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually conducts a poll about the most absurd bank charges, now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd decision or project from the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We had to this last event, in which the EU plans to take 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,&quot; &quot;Law,&quot; organiser Patrick questionnaire Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the already nominated by the nomination absurdnostej-the recent decision of the European Court to combine premium rates for both men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far, women have life insurance benefits, because insurance companies they objectively are less risky. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Further extraordinary ideas from the workshop of the EU people may put forward for tender before the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Voting itself will be held before the end of February of the year 2013, &quot;Nager said. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The controversial EU directives refers, for example, and the mandatory blending fuel, adding that as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury gradusnikov just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive, or about the size of cages for hens, risen significantly this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;sandwich-type oil&quot; or the removal from sale of classical light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must be 14 inches long. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Pan-European unit often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobbies in Brussels, which is normally protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic therefore now even under the threat of veto upheld requirements of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobby interests are: for example, bananas in the EU should reach 14 cm in length and do not dare to exercise &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has been justified by the fact that only harmonizes the existing disparate national rules that have challenged the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, despite the opposition of some States, yet softened standards for fruit and vegetables on the grounds that the existing directive will lead to rastočeniû products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Winning candidate in last year&apos;s survey, and may become EU regulation, according to which sold balloons must be accompanied by a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU appealed to the US studies, according to which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of infant death through suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years are prohibited from blowing horns at the fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Funny ideas are born and home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Enough is absurd and the rule concerning the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name Macedonia, and should instead say &quot;FYROM&quot; (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists &quot;non-intervention&quot; (Laissez Faire), proposed that, in addition to several of the above mentioned rules are absurd, for example, EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set a maximum amount of food that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the amount of canned mushrooms, for which she threatened big fines. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Organizers of the questionnaire also became interested in the idea of some countries to pay for what they don&apos;t have and idea for subsidies to the statement about getting grants. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague rather than in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The European Union will ask for compensation, &quot;said autumn 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument, he pointed out that the country has a high grain yield, and as a result the so-called Interventional procurement of State had full warehouses stocks which had to be removed. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the Czech Republic is far from the port, EU, according to Palasu, we had to pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic by holding a tender for purchase of grain from countries that are landlocked. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Grants for obtaining grants offered to villages, the Ministry for regional development, presided by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on drawing up applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU orders are an exception: fancy </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the regulations in Member States can easily become the target of criticism, EU efforts to regulate, as well as on improving the functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Serious problem, experts say, is the EU grants to the drafts of the scoop, which do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have made in the discussions on the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Causes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels over the right of a specific identification of its traditional products, and it doesn&apos;t always wins in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have retained the name &quot;Olomouc curd cheese&quot;, but &quot;Tuzemskij&quot;, whose tradition of rum in our country are rooted in the 19 century, our producers have been renamed to &quot;Tuzemak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Products can only be called rum from sugar cane distillate, not from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Official list of registered products in the EU, along with the world famous cheese &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;gorgonzola&quot;, Marzipan from Lübeck German or Parma ham already have, for example, Carlsbad rusks, pogorželickij tršebon′skij and saaz hops and CARP. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The trademark of the EU can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and goržickie tubules. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to defend the Republic, but I am a fan, &quot;says Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, as a man comes to my mind to run for President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think that to become a Senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we have all worked with no problems, then I will not be balloted. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t watch how over the last 20 years, the country gets stolen by thieves, as people scurry here, raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like, then try to find a solution like this edit. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am over forty years and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of Senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You&apos;ve come to the Senate, but soon went into the presidential Castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Don&apos;t you turn your back to the people so that you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I keep saying that the vklûčus′ Castle for President based on the results of the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> I later clarified that if I selected Senator, I will run for President. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My purpose is not a post, the post is a tool with which I can make their views known. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the biggest impact and tremendous power. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the difficulty not only in what we as a nation start complaining at the bar or in front of the TV set, but are willing to destroy anyone who would try to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To this is added the media which denigrated the man and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was Adviser Jiri Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Move on to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> For President Castle you started with theses about the material and the criminal responsibility of politicians and the inverse property declarations for the amount above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do this, you need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have no such authority as President, and only the whole Senate can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I, as a citizen, lobbied to free enterprise was a guided tour operation, it was able to move. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is political posturing-when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or right side, it has deliberately obstructed, and this deters citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am no partisan of deploying on the shelves, without regard to the tenets of each party can take what is best for our country, and to apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a person, more relevant to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that me people relate more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Not important at all for me-a little to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it is important that we were moving forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not that someone is right and someone is to the left, I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good for the community, whether it will propose to the KSCM or FDB, and I&apos;m just going against a bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry when someone says that you&apos;re populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it&apos;s not whether you prove what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try to get closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all the suggestions of which I speak, are already in operation in the world, or leading experts talk about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics you don&apos;t survive for long. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other possibility. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to his side, so we made her. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected President, he would not issue a live television broadcast, in which I will turn to the Chairmen of the parliamentary parties to support and legitimize the criminal liability for politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, in case of failure, will have to indicate why it doesn&apos;t want to. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality that will abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the President-it was due to public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Say directly that I&apos;m a lover, not a genius and not intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and attitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I&apos;m just a beginner in politics, and for its attempt to gain majority support. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Cause I&apos;m trying to promote themselves; If this is not possible, through six years of graduate and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is partly sounds as though Okamura has to rescue the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a Savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know the one I&apos;ll do nothing, so I bypassed a number of famous people to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to the Radimu Ânčure, he refused due to the large volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I also supported at least the lead investigative journalist Jan Lorencovu, which uncovered a fraud with light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward my candidacy because people really are dissatisfied, but I now feel on the scales. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not go to the elections, and a majority of those who went to chose representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are independent in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People chose the Senate so that the changes will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, such as direct elections for mayors and Governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought of, because I have no time to check the purity of the past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money for it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You speak of property declarations, and what about your own backyard with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property is estimated to be about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague cost about 25 million, 10 million, flat in another apartment at 8 million, the art collection of approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and the Skoda Superb in a million, and several million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Aston Martin-the way I have because it was my mal′čišeč′â dream-I have always liked James Bond, who had traveled by car, has been woman galanten and at the same time fought against meanness and wickedness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You ride on Aston-Martin, own the property at 60 million and you don&apos;t have the money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want change, but it&apos;s their own money to invest in particular do not want to. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I invested in a campaign already has 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not as interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I would not be obligated to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Campaign costs me essentially cover the Senatorial salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But for that money I would not have lived, for example, could pay the son of English school, which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted just to earn money, so will not be balloted. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Then, you will continue to engage in Enterprise so that you can live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Wouldn&apos;t you say that shorten this up? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this does not depend on the size of the paycheck. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I am partially reduced their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the Managing Director of a travel agency in the spring will be my Deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would be like, what I was bessrebrennikom that would keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also have to live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> But as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to receiving monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From 200 to 400 thousand, get and go on. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I become President, that its business would be finished. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You can find the full interview in Saturday&apos;s Edition of the newspaper &quot;Right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Architects MVRDV prove that real adventures happen not only in imagination-the examples of Spejkenisse and its newly-built Book-2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think it is fun, it looks like the mythical, we finally have again you can see something interesting,&quot; said Lisette Verhajg, a passerby at the edge of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, it professional at the nearby large enterprise, said: &quot;no, this building is really nice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask myself: why do we need another library today? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and eBooks. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now voluntarily does not go into such old fashioned library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spejkenisse, maloprimečatel′nomu their town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> It has a population of 80.000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this unfortunate circumstance was decided several years ago to contribute to general education and build seven imaginary bridges that are depicted on banknotes of the euro, in a beautifully painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the city fathers realized that they remained the only way to defeat the stats: build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Vini Maas from MVRDV of Rotterdam architectural Bureau, master of bold column charts and the author of witty, sometimes cynical, treated the task with his usual unflappability and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003, with five books under the arm and a smirk on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while jurors looked puzzled and shrugged shoulders, saucy Maas folded from his original gift pyramids in size and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my suggestion: &quot;Mountain Book&quot; in Spejkenisse, aka Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later it cost 30 million euros has increased. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, supermarket, post office and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the Book &quot;mountain&quot; was awarded the second prize of the contest &quot;the best library of the Netherlands, 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project also participates in the national Dutch competition wooden buildings 2012 year. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb, who previously could not offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and amazingly ugly Town Hall, white facades which suggest that the milk is richer by one modern piece of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But the most important thing in Spejkenisse was the first in the history of this town public building cultural facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: book Eldorado under the hood for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Here only one elevator that goes to the heart of the mountain range, because the real fans will choose to read architecture and explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Osteklennoe on all sides of the room is light and easily foreseeable, fired brick floors and elegant street lights to create the feeling of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is recreated. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Mind involuntarily looking benches of dogs playing football and boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere-books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, in the middle of a large dark room, usually it is comfortless and faceless,&quot; said Winnie Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic configuration space upside down and dragged the zone to read from the inside to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The internal space of book mountains of used skillfully: in central offices, online library, Chess Club, Environmental Center and technical facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially please the black book shelves that serve as the finished walls, parapets, staircases, railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture and scent are unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even experienced architects and civil engineers are baffled, what is this unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with secondary materials,&quot; explains Joop Trauborst, project manager, representing the community of Spejkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland have suitable agricultural by-product. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a base for roots is an artificial fibre material millimeter of thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It&apos;s cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Subtle textiles serves as a one-season two, after that you can throw away. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For this canvas library-first in the volumes-it was spressovano in the four centimetres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, by smell a little bit like a new car and a bit of running shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the lead 105 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> The one who will overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and wood rubber plant in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the environment, and particularly on the correct humidity for literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Costs of the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe, but this building, despite the plethora of glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For the heating and cooling of the Earth&apos;s heat is used. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cover, even on clear days the Sun enters only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Vast farms of laminated wood perpendicular glass facade, provide shade and assume most of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Indoor climate very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest provide protection completely automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, referred to above, a skeptic of it, has already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhajg also has already been here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as traditional Chinese Medicine Professor Cynthia Bogarde, called Bukenberg &apos; soul Spejkenisse, which has long been missing. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from my own collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully loaded libraries-at that time there were 70,000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a polupustaâ library,&quot; said architect Vini Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that through our invitation now everyone in some way relate to this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV has overcome a Royal task that jargon is called an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spejkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is only the starting point for building identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Saba: &quot;the Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the voting on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, by doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Germany earlier in the week at first hinted that it would vote against the nomination of Palestinians to receive Observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then, Berlin had abstained in the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Sabo: Germany doesn&apos;t support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany now needs to be cautious with regard to its special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that the American position, it is also not supported. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without speaking too critical towards Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 year Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO had carried out this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is hard to take a clear position on sensitive international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The thing is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely shifting from policies, which, so to speak, to the United States, operated by the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans there is no agreed common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they grope for a role, but on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy which holds France or United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly does &quot;normal&quot; with the German foreign policy point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It will be in its national interest, regardless of the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and links to specific regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are very different from those of other large States, so Germany has to defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and voted on in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I wouldn&apos;t give it too much weight, it&apos;s not entirely one-way. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it is important in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Whether Germany has hurt its relations with the United States abstaining, in making important decisions, such as a vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even the United States dominates the understanding of German positions. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think it was a dramatic change of heart, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Germany may even become so some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, it means that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that with its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, the United States clearly favoured the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> If there is a divergence of views between the United States and many European States? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of American domestic policy, the differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that deep down Obama&apos;s Government has a sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But the local political situation, the Government of course cannot openly hold this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the significant difference of opinion is not so great, as always. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama was not thrilled by the policies of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to reconcile Germany&apos;s close ties with Israel and the United States on one side and the situation in the EU important partner on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that&apos;s what makes the situation difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there were a unified European policy, uncontroversial, but now it&apos;s not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they do not appear to be part of a broader approach and are forced to act, instead relying only on their own vision. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Just like they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany would take the lead in formulating a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, if only because of links with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This theme has always been tricky. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player-not whether it would take a really central role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or the leading role Germany is still hard? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis-every time Germany assumes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans did not just deal with that. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, it&apos;s an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account all different views, and neighbors and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So the United States influence in European politics is waning, but the EU does not fill this vacuum, who stays? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like it, distasteful or enhances the dislike to you-such is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Sabo-Deputy Director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, d.c., the Institute, in which academics and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America together explore the problem of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Szabo – member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, and United States foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Trademark protection in China: the Puma and Armani will suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> This is the officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with firms from the names which it is formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it will be protected until the owners of the original titles will not sue. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But even then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are more difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer for the firm of Taylor Wessing, specialised on violations of trademark rights in the far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week, appears on a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitatoram enough to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So it turns out the Gucci of Lu-Gucci, Prada Prada, instead you can register-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloh opens the folder with the trademark office records in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered the trademark there Zegna DF Puma, artificial title, which also used the name fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese world champions on copying and infringement of intellectual property rights, you know. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities there is a multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively to counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, such cases are not Pattloha. On behalf of their principals, he is opposed to the Chinese enterprises are officially received from the Trademark Office, the right to use a title that is already somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;ban minpaj&quot;, mark-the passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with &quot;ban dakuan′&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So call women who hunt for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is damaging to business, the need to fight&quot;,-Pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand erodes the unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial and procedural costs in the affected branches of millions, especially in the case of expensive products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to market research firm CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, removing dubious entries in the register of trade marks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloh talks about cases in which the Court rejected lawsuits, because after a long time the name was rejected by the &quot;real market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff is successful, he will have to pay even plagiatoru since damaging his trademark in China, said Pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there are ruled by the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous case about adorners. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the company Daimler lost the dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, Enterprise, which had recently acquired the firm-manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have a right to use a logo similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> &apos;&apos; Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo, reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Manufacturer fashion goods Lacoste in China lost to imitatoram from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile was looking the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Chinese authorities did not consider himself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirmed that the year 2010 due to a lack of staff and equipment of premises there were difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year there was a &quot;return from an emergency situation to normal in the workflow. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of untreated cases of objections dropped by 22 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting in the production department. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fight this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As very often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trade marks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and meant that for the tenth time in a row, China topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The 2011 year, 1.8 billion yuan was paid fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 Yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Oppose it is worth many times more, as shown by the case of the German Freudenberg family enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years of age concern fights against Chinese plagiary. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans led to the illegal production of counterfeit automotive parts was eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the Simulator has a Chinese trademark law Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> This was its own omission, since the names are not eligible for protection in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Board Chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Registration of marks and the CTMO rejected the claim early storm. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both instances the following Freudenberg won but the other party continues to fight so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You must be alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the issue is before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;the process is very expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs almost immeasurable archive of firms had to see even the acts of a hundred years ago, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, offered the other party without Freudenberg &quot;large six figure sum in euros&quot; for settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It is clear to us is how expensive it is,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Danger far East threaten to spill over, even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Namely, if there be a simulators unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name of Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but it could prevent registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You need to be alert,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and Attorney Pattloh recommend German firms to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on the international provisions on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be &quot;anything that is in any way worth defending, record also in China,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it could get much more expensive than registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg would lose in the final act of his drama about a trade mark, should the other party will pay license fees for its own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we would surely affect the market in the disputed segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: pritoptyvat′, sing, assist </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg-AIDS orphans in Swaziland and rejoice at this. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> History of relations emerging from a distance of over 8733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First you hear a stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies and gents slipper boats picking up the beat on the hardwood floor and quickly find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only after that slowly builds up the voices of singers-Viola, bass, tenor and soprano-they are coming, enchant and follow each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Hopf, 29 Fité-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his cloth shoes, which leads to their flexible and expressive gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearses a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> The rehearsal came fifty choir members from 23 to 69 years old, from specialistki human genetics to the janitor. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&quot;Obani &quot;is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a whole about Zulu language, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and parts. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to Unaids, the United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS, worldwide there are about 34 million HIV-infected people. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> 245000 lives in Swaziland AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> With more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Èsitženi combining Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them in school, preparing for further study. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take on patronage. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It accords the child money for school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in the GoGo area. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi on Zulu language means the Narrator or voshvalitel′. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room do not speak fluently on the Bantus, but they can sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost ten years the choir is learning this song on someone else&apos;s soft tongue and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After a summer of Heidelberg 8733 kilometers to the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Èsitženi, which depends on the votes of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty per cent of infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> There are about 2000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among residents of many children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have been left without parents who have died of the virus HIV. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Èsitženi in miniature reflects the total disease Swaziland: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male circumcision has proved that reduces the risk of infection by half, to the public almost never accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland are a virus, death at the midway through the fourth ten-not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village in a joint mission to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the Imbogni saw many children in the streets who lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without schooling in a person in a poor country there is no chance at all. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was an obligation of the participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give it to every day receive hot food. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later the choir he founded the Association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, which has since been almost professionally cares for Aids orphans in Èsitženi. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> To bacterial STIS are chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea (gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STIS are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic Lice and scabies are parasitic STD. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups infected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute, believes that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Heterosexual adults have frequent sexually transmitted chlamydial infections are trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low-around 20 per cent, but new HIV infections occur in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydial infection among youth are significantly more likely than among other populations. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European statistics, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> We have among youth is also common human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How does the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases, subject to mandatory registration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 2011 3698 cases per year. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections declined from 2007 onwards. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In the year 2011 was about 2700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> That&apos;s about one-tenth less than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> In infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as bubbles or seals. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can be spread by contact with an infection and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when frequent change of sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> In the early diagnosis of most STIS can be cured and avoid long-term effects. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Sponsorship, donations and fees for speaking choir throughout Germany to collect something. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We have sent in Èsitženi about 200000 euros,&quot; says Mrs. Anette Lennartc, Chairman of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Inside the village money from Germany manages Codva Dlamini, conscious and active woman. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also takes care of the orphans have been well arranged, for example, one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Gogos, as known to the Zulu old women, this pillar of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have to carry up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and take care of the kids in uniform each day in time to appear on the lessons. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who have no relatives came to the shelter to the Hanijsile, a lonely woman, receives a salary from the Association, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, the Association &quot;Voices for Africa organized the sewing school, built a chicken coop and two in conjunction with the u.s. health care delivery has PSI testing for HIV for many villagers. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It&apos;s hard to imagine, but a disease so evident throughout the country, prefer the deeply silent. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> King with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Mrs. Anette Lennartc, &quot;because it is associated with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for the country in which the King officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his love of superfluity. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> In particular, the State-sanctioned style of living also bears the blame for the fact that the virus had spread so quickly ICH in years past. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But she is also on the stray workers who carry the virus. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms are literally on every corner, &quot;says Mrs. Anette Lennartc, but they hardly use. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Different culture-flesh to flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To support cultural exchange, Hor Ibmogni every two to three years of visiting South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black consciousness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the days of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Bus full of white, who sing songs at the black c-such recognition not only brings joy and good mood, but even that has caused severe tears to the eyes of border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip also leads to Èsitženi always where the singers attending the sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite being a small village barely can be found on the map, in the Valley of the river Èculveni it more than is known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to the Èsitženi, there&apos;s light,&quot; people here say. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And 8733-kilometer flight after back to Heidelberg, singers when stomping back to rehearsal hall Berghajmer Street, you can see that the light is lit here. </seg>

<seg id="1789"> United States space agency NASA confirmed the presence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that the region is constantly in the shadow of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness must be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Presumably, the water comes from a comet or asteroid may be affected by mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one links the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, &quot;said supervisor Sean Solomon of the probe. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on mercury could reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life in other places in the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as &quot;Phoenix&quot;, exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time they send to Earth pictures: small Windows in the infinite distances. </seg>

<seg id="1886"> Talysh live here-one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about whom little is known except that they speak in Farsi and azerbajždanskom and have longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Lerik is the destination. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Small town boasts unwieldy Soviet-era architecture, which is not in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>

<seg id="1891"> The legendary wealth which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here in the province, until it got. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilate&apos;s Fatulaeva (48), is convinced that there is something in Lerik interest tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In may, Baku became a Festival song contest-and next year we will have the world&apos;s oldest Festival,&quot; said Fatulaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here documented Biography about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which are more than 100 years. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, it is 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> 136 years of age he was born another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the Museum is the Shepherd Mûslûmov, who supposedly Shirali turned 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificate, however, does not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given that the oldest person whose age was confirmed by documents turned 122 year age Mûslûmova is extremely questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in this area in the year 1805, died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he had a child at the age of 23, 136 years he had a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So there Chaban Mûslûmov added a couple dozen years to your age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher from the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of dolgožitelâh in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Shockingly many elderly people is also found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; said Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia also lived extremely a lot of very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, for lack of scientific proof of age documents are impossible, since there was no civil status registers. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Daily cup of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> However, there&apos;s the fact that people in the area are often startlingly Lerika biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now it is home to 20 people older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the South, so many long-livers? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijan&apos;s Farid Mugimzade guide explains this particular genes of Talysh. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The Director of the Museum of the Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believe that the case for food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysh people love meat, bread and dairy products, many of them drinking glass melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy with Dietetic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or the case in primitive lifestyle that keeps people young? In Čengemirane, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In the 97 years old she is still a relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzaeva, which asserts that it has 143 descendant who lives in a simple wooden house typical for the whole Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here, under one roof, eight people, including one of Mirzaevoj sons and daughter, who have been already have their grandchildren. </seg>

<seg id="1921"> The Mirzaevoj is perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the head scarf she hides out long dark blond tresses, which her son proudly Unveils in front of us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always have my hair milk, so they never get lost and saved color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I&apos;ve never used the shampoo,&quot; said Mirzayev. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only what has grown in your own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For the rest of my life, I&apos;ve never bought groceries. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband, who served in the military. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The hardest was after the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it got better when &quot;favorite father Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda does not often heard in the speech of the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost does not know borders. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until the year 2003, then took the reins of power to his son Ilkham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> However, there is no poverty among old people in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 manats (roughly equal to the same amount in euros) monthly as Mirzaeva receives pensions, to local conditions is the amount by which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps long ago grew up the son of Mirzaevoj rights, too: &quot;old men in our culture enjoyed great respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a large family, loved, cared and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> No reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;right&quot; is not in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution came back to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo, showed a deep schism in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future Constitution based on Sharia, met furious resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian President not begrudging the pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And its success rests on my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on State television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all people, but particularly to Christian koptam, Liberals, Muslims and unreligious&apos;s enlightened Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, they are still hopelessly fragmented opposition in rasterânnoj afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a religious State on the Nile at the mercy of powerful &quot;Muslim brothers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetic, said he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competence &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and to the entire world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judiciary lacks power? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Actually managed to pull through in 234 articles 15-hour night jump obstacles at the Constitutional Assembly is configured islamistski of 100 participants, and partly with apprehension. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft States that the procedure is based on the principles of Islamic law &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does it mean to &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and you fear that Islamists will use vague wording and it occurs due to a legal backlash to a more strict interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least this one hints at the newest article: in all cases concerning Sharia law should be brought to the Council of the University of Al-Ashar district, the highest institution of the country Islamist enjoying great prestige around the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It shouldn&apos;t, but it could mean that the clergy will oversee the legislation that would be de facto consequence of limiting judicial power. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The draft Constitution has been the subject of much interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another concern: until jurisdiction of civilians in a military court. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts during Mubarak&apos;s Government served to suppress dissidents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11.000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family and support her morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally this is worded poorly that public agencies with the help of this article even be able to control the content of films and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Plain text this means nothing less than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Generally no article does not set explicitly the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But the other prohibits the insult and defame the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> It also seems questionable wording that prohibits &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Whether it will be enough for President jokes or cartoons about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> A question of interpretation, like so much in this project, which provides for the signature and Morsi, who, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be submitted to a referendum of the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution is back&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> For weeks now, the opposition is forming against the dominance of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity in the evening Friday in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir square and vowed to destroy it before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is back, and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, said the draft Constitution &quot;the junkyard of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Through the short news Twitter he accused supporters of the Mursi of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If it will announce a referendum, we&apos;ll go to his palace and his skinem,&quot; the oppositionist said Yasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We have not tired, the blood of our brothers have not otmŝena,&quot; media quoted Egyptian opposition politician, Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many judges also said they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Quran is our Constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the demonstration, but opposite, out of precaution, not in Tahrir square, and after mass prayers on the other Bank of the River Nile in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It was attended by a large number of women under the Bedcovers and Salafis, adherents who shouted: &quot;the people requires the application of God&apos;s law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded the Mursi: &quot;Cleanse the country!&quot; and assured &quot;the Quran is our Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Power struggles over symbolic square where it all began, almost provoked a State of civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Followers of the Mursi, apparently did not want to take that risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution spoke out loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now it&apos;s time to allow the people to decide at the ballot box in what direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Most of the Islamists, this is considered resolved. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The notion of&quot; human rights &quot;is not mentioned even once&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1991"> Not because he shared their world view, but because the human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this he was beaten, arrested and sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And now, the words &quot;human rights&quot; had never encounter in the new Constitution, he lamented in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Expansion to the Mursi, all three branches of power in the State disappoints. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures represent an explicit attacks on the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to the new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil State, de facto President annulled it,&quot; Syed regretted. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> After all, democracy without civil society could not function. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Syed feels that all, even the international community which looks to the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>

<seg id="2002"> Of the 5 million population in Norway has one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Perhaps the secret of the success of this country are somehow connected with the local addiction to one very zlovonnomu fish dish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a few perezrevših pieces of cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothing. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> You otšibaûŝij smell smell rakfiska-one of the most famous Norwegian specialities. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I&apos;m in a small town called Fagernes, three hours &apos; drive from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Around the picturesque snow-covered. It is very beautiful, but in the air is that perennial characteristic smell. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is trout, sprinkled with salt and water by up to a year, depending on what exactly you want to achieve. Ducky </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As twilight and it&apos;s getting cold, crowds gather at the Festival of Norwegians in fagernes, dedicated to the, shall we say, exciting dish. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;Her eating a raw and served with a shot of vodka, akvavit local tminnoj,&quot; explains Hal′varsen, Havard local fireman by profession and a part-time &quot;General rakfiskovyj&quot;, who runs the Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> All around us people eat fish and cut small cubes of sizable portions of its combination with alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Someone like aquavit than rakfisk&quot; says Håvard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This drink is able to kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a couple of the pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad--not unlike servings of sushi that you have long carried with him into the bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty when, before the advent of refrigeration, the fish in the fall was steeped in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then deep in winter, when the fish is good and thoroughly zabrodila, were extracted and, by muting the perception of alcohol consumed as food. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Another memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants who have jobs here, high salaries and extensive system of social security. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> People in Sweden (a longtime rival, and not so long ago and far more prosperous neighbor) to come here to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is perceived as some important symbol, a necessary, albeit somewhat malodorous element past Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> On the other hand, everything here is expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £ 9 (14 United States dollars). </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the population of the country it seems comfortable with. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breivik, racist and right-wing extremist, who shot last year and 77 had killed men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Without mentioning his name, called the attack &quot;happened on July 22. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians very hard to believe that they are a peace-loving country one of their compatriots was capable of such atrocities and killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> At the heart of today&apos;s prosperity of Norway is rising (early seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, raznosâŝaâ trays with seasoned rakfiskom, woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the epitome of the Nordic welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We the people-as you call it is reasonable. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Like most Norwegians, she speaks English. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We don&apos;t like to exhibit at the show, we do not hvastlivy. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway very carefully drawn from their oil-most of the revenue of the oil and gas industry is invested in special fund established for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> In the years leading up to the world financial crisis, when all sorili money, which they didn&apos;t have, Norway has been carefully calculated all the costs. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;Until you can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, this is sufficient for happiness,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And there is rakfisk,&quot; she adds with a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand in the snow waiting for any meal-rakfiska enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Here&apos;s a burger with meat with Elk is certainly exotic, delicious, juicy meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening we will see more of the same with the unforgettable smell of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In my hotel have a special dinner, featuring the rakfisk, during which customers vote determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> Is live TV, the show&apos;s lead in the tie-butterfly, surrounded by plates from rakfiskom. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> This is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;So, Thor-Jürgen, what grade you have put on a better fish out there in the mountains?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Yes, that&apos;s our assessment, Håvard.&quot; ... </seg>
<seg id="2047"> All laugh and applaud. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Someone falls off the Chair, perhaps by looping through the akvavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe just breathing the smell of this fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto to be difficult early life. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> Until the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to enter the post, BBC reporter Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and the mixed expectations of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico City now in particularly poor condition. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> This city is overloaded transport and at a better time, and Monday were erected steel barricades, pererezavšie several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, this was not done in order to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, and to prevent protestors reaching the Parliament building. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto will put on the presidential sash and take the reins of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> It faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now adds its powers, however, the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has already claimed some 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My Government expresses to the people of Mexico to fight violence,&quot; said earlier this week, Mr. Peña Nieto, United States President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before such statements next to the President of the United States political career of Mr. Peña Nieto had developed as Governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, the new leader&apos;s views are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Straight man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic village of Valle de Bravo, for example, about it remember with fondness. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents put him credit for reviving tourism, the development of resort areas and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> The town can be reached on a new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto which are substantially different from roads with potholes and pits, which were formerly on this site. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Signs with his name hanging on a modern building and a sports centre on the spectacular interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We associate with it hopes for real and serious changes,&quot; said his friend and political ally of Gabriel Hernández Olvera, a Congressman from the State led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We look forward to real and decisive change that our country so desperately needs, primarily in the areas of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years of uninterrupted stay in power PRI party ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12 year absence at the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos party places great hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He also denies accusations of triviality, which made opposition to the new President. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is very straightforward and very committed to translate its vision for the future of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is a superb statesman, and, above all, the person who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in another part of a lot of people have a different idea of the former Governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> A Nesaual′kojotl′, also known as Ciudad Neza, is the most striking contrast with cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden beneath a motorway Flyover, in many ways, it is a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And problems in the municipality are too harsh, megalopolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year to quell gangs selling drugs in those areas, troops were recruited; (a) violence against women is particularly acute here. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On waste ground near a vast landfill just in the last two years was found dozens of bodies of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than a thousand women have been killed in the State of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto is well above this figure in a new notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to killing innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to opponents, Mr. Peña Nieto, it can at best say that during his tenure as Governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of femicide. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, his Administration accused of ignoring the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> A resident of concrete houses, like the majority of houses in this dilapidated area, Irinej, Buendia had trouble holding back tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of Marian in 2010 year, committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she killed her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I got to her house, it seemed that her body was washed out before that,&quot; recalls Ms. Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that her body had already beaten, and okočenelo. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Mother Mariana retells the story, a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix, which is just one word: fairness. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> This, they said, the family was denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;State officials treated me like the old spletnicej, the disaffected have breached any calm. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people to just take it on faith that everything they say and pomalkivali. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But this is wrong, so you cannot, especially when there are so many irregularities and mistakes, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Wearing the presidential sash on Saturday, President of the Peña Nieto with it will assume a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised the crimes of violence, and the new President promised to make the solution a priority during his reign. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be exactly the same as President was the Governor,&quot; said Olvera, Congressman from Valle de Bravo of the PRI party. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, it is the most feared of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley manning complained of mistreatment, said the prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to rebut Bradley manning of poor conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> During the hearing, increased attention has been given to the presence of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Protection requires close the case on the ground that the conditions of detention were Manning cruel. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> United States Army private accused of stealing thousands of secret documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Pvt. Bradley Manning, who was accused in the biggest leak of classified materials in the history of the United States, has used many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment which, according to him, he had to shift from a military prison. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross-examination at pre-trial hearing at Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Gen. Èšden Féin stated that the record of weekly visits by representatives of the prison authorities Manning for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints of maltreatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Cross-examination of the defence motion to dismiss Manning on the ground that the conditions of his detention were cruel and by themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Naval Intelligence Analyst, was arrested in June 2010 year, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> These materials were subsequently published on the Internet site WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was manning. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the hearing Friday, Prosecutor Fein along with Manning scanned the reports, which were filled by representatives of the Administration after Manning visits during his stay in prison, Quantico, where he was on a strict regime of detention from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> During his visits to prison officials asked Mènningu questions and answers recorded it. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When the prosecutor asked Fein about the reports Friday, Manning acknowledged that the appeal to the prison administration as &quot;excellent&quot;, and general terms as &quot;organised very professionally.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Considered by the reports do not contain complaints of maltreatment, although Manning was asked directly about the conditions of his detention, says Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning responded that he had expressed concern about those issues and a voice that sang his administration officials have discussed these concerns with him and stated that they would not have fixed this in writing. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They recorded&quot; no problem &quot;(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I did not raise this issue in a conversation,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of mistreatment with it in January 2011, during the meetings of the Commission, which considered suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing in the months before that. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he removed the &quot;injury prevention&quot; and softened conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Representatives of the military authorities explained that the limited regime of detention is at the level lower than the supervisory regime to prevent suicide-was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to give the administration know that I&apos;m alright so they lifted injury prevention ... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view, &quot;explained Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that thoughts of suicide, he appeared in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of the intense heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He explained that psychologically very hard when you do not know how to deal with your plight, and what is happening in the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world has shrunk to the Base Camp-Arifžan, to the size of my prison, Manning said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> -I thought I would die in that cage. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell, at least 9:0 pm and often even more 11:0 pm per day-all alone. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, slippers, several items of clothing and sunglasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He said he tried to move, because the sleep or even just lie in the daytime rules prohibit. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> According to manning, while sleeping in his eyes he constantly beat the light getting out the camera. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he was rotating in bed at night, he said, he awakened and forced to turn over on your back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer filed a formal objection to the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011 the year Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also on Friday, judge Manning asked about a statement he made during the testimony on Thursday that after one night, he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of other prisoners and guards at the morning inspection. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning said he had not been able to hide behind a blanket during the test. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order that the guardian must give up the blanket, which could to hide behind, but admitted that no one not directly ordered him to throw it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he had been forced to sleep naked because his attempts to show the officer that he was no danger to themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that the officer said that he could use the elastic of underpants or flip-flops to injure themselves, but failed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, according to manning, his underwear, slippers and eyeglasses taken away from the camera. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that the judge will take into account, at least what he experienced during his detention, and significantly reduce the term of imprisonment, if Manning would be found guilty by a military court, which is to begin considering his case early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Protection stated that plans to offer Mènningu to accept blame for less serious crimes, others challenge the charges as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention were acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon argues that Manning was being held at Quantico, in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with the most strict regime. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges are Mènningu, aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of disclosure of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence, and the theft of State property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination-story American of Mexican descent. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind people about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexican Americans are torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed along the corridor for arriving, approached the border control zone and froze in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues, one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds in front of them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I stopped at the elaborate design &quot;an American of Mexican descent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here at home, my grandfather didn&apos;t need in the titles or complex designs. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my English vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took out my American passport and has been in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto has visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were the traditional meetings between the Presidents of those countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> President of the Peña Nieto readily talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, which the Mexicans now, as well, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to travel to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the President of the Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been named. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, relations with the United States-heavy and filled with old grudges. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to abandon half its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of the events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is therefore worth only a United States statesman, without even a word of criticism toward Mexico in the press and among the elite Mexican society there are complaints that the Americans would impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most difficult is the relationship of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about injustice? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find themselves in this country, and those for whom no such opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many of people of Mexican descent only for one reason: at some point in their family history who ever is the father or grandfather did not have the opportunity to fulfil themselves in Mexico and was forced to March North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most often these were Mexicans of a certain type-dark, poorly educated, from poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We, their descendants, and we remember it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see this differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made ourselves a good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is an American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know what country commit itself. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> United States Of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and ruling class we do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We answer them. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens, as the fake Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not sufficiently speak in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence to them due to failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not have been on it now for the silk curtain, finding United States in my life, but having lost spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the United States legally as a child, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent there was some friction-Mexicans better aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican descent is a shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not feel affiliation to either of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico we are Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> But in the United States we are Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relationship without having enough muddled, some Mexican intellectuals and leaders want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want Mexican Americans were a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented her interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends Americans about what a wonderful country this is and how great it is to attend, and might persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yup, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It won&apos;t work. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many hard feelings in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe this country so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but go sort it yourself, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the part of Mexicans still can&apos;t forgive the United States the way they did with Mexico 150 years ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still mad for the way most recently treated in Mexico with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battle on the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile basis for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Could a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodletting pushes the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound, the habitual, pointless bickering about who first started; many buildings have been turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, fired rockets from the Gaza Strip fell in the area of Israel&apos;s capital of Tel Aviv to the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in its essential conflict came to the Middle East for a change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To this can be treated differently, but the events of the &quot;Arab spring&quot; zakružili in the rebel storm many well-established realities, with the Israelis and Palestinians could not stay away from the vortex that shocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their fight will be even bloodier than previously. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of the deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, this situation does not give cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement which was signed on November 21, will run on skirmishes this week only strengthened the position of security officials from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, who came to power in Gaza in 2007, indicated that they had forced Israel to retreat despite the loss. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some leaders of the factions were destroyed and 1.7 million people are locked in one of the most densely populated and the problematic parts of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas has increased its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian-controlled territory, currently the more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time works for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Reviving regional leader of Turkey, once Israel&apos;s closest ally among the Muslim countries, has the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing of the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubilant Hamas supporters say establishing an Islamist Crescent around Israel, from Lebanon to the North, which is ruled by a paramilitary group, Hezbollah, and Syria, in which the rebels increasingly proislamistskie are overthrown by the power of Bashar Assad, and on to Jordan, where the King&apos;s power to threaten Hamas allies. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where President Muhammad Mursi has strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who ruled for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator, not people emphasis in support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood Organization, by contrast, are in many ways similar to Hamas and its leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even to Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, proponents of &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Hamas had militarily defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile system &quot;iron dome&quot; lives up to the cost of creating and successfully destroyed many of Hamas launched rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep soundly, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States stayed true to its consistent position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that with 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel was able to minimise the problem of suicide bombers, partly through the wall that extends into the West Bank of the Jordan River-a large part of the Palestinian State and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party is in preparation for the elections scheduled for January 22-has teamed up with an even more aggressive conservatives, led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What is the meaning of pander to the Palestinians and give them a State of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you give away all the power in their hands throughout the West Bank, not whether they will run out of rockets toward Israel, as do their counterparts in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is best to keep them behind a wall and severely repress any attempts to lift the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the proponents of &quot;hard&quot; line will prevail; However, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warmest feelings for Israel, the priority will be the internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget larger than all its Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the Governments of Arab countries to strengthen their own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism, morsi, President of Egypt, which together with Barack Obama worked on the ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not least, should take into account long-term consequences of their policies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus blasted in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression has already undermined the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect-growth Arab population-only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody operation, which are held every few years in Gaza to crush Hamas, have to pay the rising discontent in the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need the external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Remains the only solution to which relentlessly call for sensible, representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of a two-State solution and Israel&apos;s territorial concessions in Exchange for safety. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope remains, not too impressive in the short-term, hope that the cease-fire will allow other countries to more effectively influence on parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which it is high time to take action to block the flow of weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish State&apos;s borders, taken from 1967 onwards, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries also need to make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would make for the creation of a Palestinian State more than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, the result of which could result in the recognition of virtual statehood for Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Its role is to bring Israel back to the negotiating table, and President Obama has to play. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented its own plan for a peaceful settlement. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to address this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is disastrously short-sighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is only possible in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia, the Act entered into force on standardized packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the dangers of smoking and the image contrast affected by diseases of body parts are saddest on green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first Australian in world practice the same package of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color design of different brands of the same box sadly-olive drab with scary images of disease-affected parts of the body, and images of children whose health undermined their parents smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the batches entered on a mandatory basis from this Saturday-name brands that are printed in the same small print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the harshest conditions in the world for packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Federal Government of Australia States that the objective of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, the habit of denying status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for such a decision based on the results of studies have shown that people who smoke are up to 26 years old, in 99 cases out of 100 will never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is clear that even in very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring the tobacco companies by means of the packaging,&quot; said Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing that, for example, the Crown in the logo associated with the idea of children&apos;s Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures already are considering others. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strenuously opposed enactment of the Act. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the black market share, which will be sold cheap and affordable cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to grave consequences different from those who thought it was,&quot; said Scott Mcintyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For others, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that demand for silicone cigarette cases and cases that hide nasty pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew (virtually zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco case is lost in the High Court of Australia, which tried to appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already realized about six thousand products wholesale businesses and expects the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> It is a good business for us. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely those on which these measures are directed. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia, making illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sports events, as well as prohibiting cigarette sellers to display in a conspicuous place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian Government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot restrict the foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you trade in tobacco products, and you have only this small loophole, the idea is to promote your product on the Internet seems very tempting,&quot; said Becky Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted the increase in the number of reviews on trade marks composed of individuals appear to regular users in such social networks like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Question-is this the handiwork of an ordinary citizen who so loves Marlboro cigarettes that took the time and effort and made the video, or the advertising campaign behind it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of British American Tobacco Company claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules, rather than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Tobacco industry representatives have even gone on such measures as sponsoring, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States make claims under the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries &apos; trade relations with Australia were very low. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Tanya Plibersek, said the Government was discussing with the other countries to adopt similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada imposed the first mandatory posting of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening the laws discussed in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia defiantly disobey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures do not hurt me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay much attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just a vyhvatyvaeš′ cigarette and a WAD in his pocket pryachesh &apos;,&quot; explains Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes with a photo of the tumor cavity on a pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Honestly, the only thing that would make me throw-this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, shop manager tobacco King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package has confused the task of placing the goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I used to have to offload the party was leaving an hour and four hours now,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The Government should take is to ban cigarettes, we&apos;d then said: what do you do, okay, it&apos;s over, we close the shop,&quot; he says, vskidyvaâ Ruki vverh. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Miss world electronic networks and persistent connections-it&apos;s not too bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and it was replaced by another aircraft which we have awaited. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there is not much help, no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But lately, more scientists and experts on child development favour the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that, in certain situations, for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain to digress to interesting related topics that promotes creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And since everyone in the modern world we are constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will return to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many, felt that boredom-the invention of relatively recent times when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Not so, argues Peter Tuohy, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, the Canadian author of &quot;fascinating story boredom&quot; (Bikini Kill: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Boredom is actually boasts a very ancient history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii discovered Latin inscriptions on boredom, dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> This leaves open the question of how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, said John d. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom is often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied the materials of the studies on this topic and question 100 people in the task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have found the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;willing but not able to do what brought them satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, &quot;he says,&quot; is that a bored person does something that would do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> When apathy does not want to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The basic experienced boredom, he says, is &quot;a violation of the attention and the resulting deterioration in the mood and the feeling that time has dragged slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom may seem very similar to the depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible link between these States, skučaûŝie people see causes and circumstances in the outside world, and people experiencing depression, sees a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think that we are bored, when really we just hard to focus on something. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In its study, &quot;Idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention&quot;, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to previously conducted an experiment in which participants listened to the voice recording, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud sounds irrelevant television programmes included in the next room, heard these same sounds at a low volume, so they could barely make out, and the third group heard only voice recording without any audio track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard the TV on low volume, said that they were more likely to be bored-it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and this is ascribed to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark j. Fenske, an associate professor of Neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we are doing something uninteresting, &quot;for example, peering into a stream of products in the pipeline seeking marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Considered, he continues, that when people start to wiggle on the stool or to draw a scribble on a sheet of paper, they are doing it out of boredom, but we now know that in fact such actions do not help to just relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research has shown that children who do not prohibit fidget and swirl, learn better and remember more information than that required to sit quietly,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> At some moments we all experience boredom: when delay (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, viewing insipid movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However, different people have different degrees of inclination to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980 &apos;s to measure such individual differences researchers have developed a special &quot;scale, propensity for boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine the scale of assessment issues and approval are used, for example, &quot;much of what I have to do, monotonous and monotonously&quot; or &quot;Me too much fun, so no enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that the boys are bored girls more often, &quot;said Stephen Vodanovič, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida-especially if you have a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In General, however, teens often miss altogether. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of personal and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted via pager with almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He obtained the following results: 32% of teens said that they are bored at school and homework, and 23% have stated that they are bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> While only 3% of parents indicated that they are bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he had no details on what would be the similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that &quot;on adolescence peak propensity for boredom&quot;, mainly because children and adolescents do not fully address than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme forms it, studies show that might encourage people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risk gambling or abuse of specific substances in attempts to get rid of the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovič, who has studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us what to do with something else; This is the boredom, &quot;says Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is best to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you send this energy to play guitar or culinary experiences, you will make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you&apos;re watching TV, you will get better only for a while, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it would cease to be bored, but he learns to deal with boredom or as another way to manage your time and employment, Professor Fenske said. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And such independent regulation are involved in a wide variety of situations,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to occupy myself with something, he also learns self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that boredom to somehow extol. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But consider it something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see this is so, what we need are more likely to experience boredom, boredom is an extremely unpleasant, an insatiable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Actually people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In today&apos;s world we are used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when silence, we get lost and don&apos;t know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Unclear yet how the new law will apply to legalize marijuana in the State of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old player of the football team and the student community college in southeastern Colorado charged with a criminal offence, that soon would be perfectly legal throughout the State: storing a small portion of the marijuana and a tube in which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he was with friends in the car and was driving Lamara on the Prairie near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco summons to court for drug possession and possession of drug-device for minor offences, each of which is a fine of $ 100 and the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated as criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But the culprit? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that had been going on for several weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legalize consumption of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much on the law but on venue. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Accusations of minor offences involving marijuana are already in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which adopted a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped making accusations people aged 21 and over for possessing small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in more conservative districts, Colorado prosecutors have decided to treat existing cases of marijuana, and still attract liability for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to Mountain West vote to avoid the appearance of their new, state-licensed shops selling marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is evolving so quickly that I didn&apos;t even know what to expect next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of police in the town of Aurora to the East of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the supervisory authorities in Washington State too puzzled počesyvaût head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will generate a rule to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other States in the settlement of issues, first use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for fun. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado more structured market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; said Brian Smith, and the representative of the Council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages in the State of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith acknowledges, than to put forward any suggestions and hope that this will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no precedent for this, that we could be,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Washington State Bill, dubbed I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and for the whole year would throw the State into a State of uncertainty, where there State licensing system and the right of possession of marijuana has been legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, to strike a balance between State regulation of &quot;adequate access&quot; to the licensed marijuana trade ban within 1000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and day-care centers. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;In particular, it would be difficult to locate licensed enterprises on trade of marijuana inside the cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly formed research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> 21 November Aurora&apos;s police chief from Oates sent his staff an e-mail message that the city prosecutor&apos;s Office will no longer involve those persons who have attained the age of 21 years, the accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police cease convict people in data breaches &quot;from this moment on&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief told Oates that the police would monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will chase drug traffickers and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Prosecutor Weld County in Northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the Bill, he stated that the Office would continue to prosecute for possession of marijuana, primarily to encourage people who use its treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our agencies have Responsibility for acts that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,&quot; said Mr Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction has been mixed, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Junction, the largest town in the County is no longer prosecuted adults for possession of small amounts of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautcinger upheld that decision but also decided not to withdraw the charges on already open cases involving possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that enforcing the law until it is changed-our direct responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55 percent of Colorado voters, supported the decision, incorporating the use of marijuana for entertainment in the State and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> A contradictory reaction of inhabitants in different places of local authorities has exposed ambiguous relationship to experiment with marijuana state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The district attorneys in this matter there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains Sean Mcalister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the national organization to reform marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They&apos;ve haunted people for it, that now cannot really accept the fact that it is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington-the first States in which a small quantity of marijuana are the same as for alcohol-is destined to become a nationwide field experiment to test the idea of legalizing drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Proponents of legalization and State officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they are cautiously waiting for guidance from federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Justice Department will give way on the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, in most cases, the Federal Government has given the go-ahead for the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Narcotics Bureau is unlikely to rush into the House to seize a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become blind to the regulated recreational marijuana shops by State authorities, which are allowed under the new law, says Kevin a. Sabet, a former adviser in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado do not have to wait for action by the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election, some local governments have approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, which would not have been able to open sooner than a year later. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the State, launched a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in a position that we will issue a license to someone, then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote, and voted for that State. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still a lot of unresolved issues. </seg>

<seg id="2420"> You ask, why remember it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, a new generation of students, the center-right views, has been ruled by the same harassment. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This institutionalized and ever growing hatred for conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of students took the same protection of their rights, as that which is granted to disabled persons, sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2431"> &quot;This constitutes a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and Club members to lead a normal life,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> The first few weeks at Oxford, I was just not in the minority, I was one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy girl vosemnadcatiletnej. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Oxford feverish from hatred to the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The year before had deprived the former student of the University elected Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of budget cuts in higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such a climate it would be uncomfortable even stalinistam. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the early days of the week when freshman students get acquainted with each other and with their teachers, I first felt that waited for me to come. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I even didn&apos;t know that teachers not only turned a blind eye to bullying students-conservatives, but also gladly participated in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues-miners strike, privatization and Government opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa-penetrated through the wood-panelled walls sheathed audiences. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> On my first seminar I needed to translate French eighteenth-century text in English, and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Uajètt&quot;, said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text gave me hard, I zapinalas′. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was very bilious man with a face like a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Tètčeristy never teach French or IM just not enough brains?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students zahihikali. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> My eyes were tears. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise you to take a few basic French lessons in his spare time, unless you are very busy, rotating in the society,&quot; the probrûzžal Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room completely miserable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, a second-year student of the English Department, who identified himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said amiably. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, the situation is as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> above each suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives, will scoff. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your dad is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most freshmen-conservatives pretend they labor. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in the pub, I cowardly attempt to dissemble. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that did not agree with everything said by Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The trick failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Freshman, Faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, which he studied at Eton, said: &quot;you are the daughter of fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contagious &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have picked up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was tainted, tainted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;As Conservatives are having sex? One of them asked. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> -They battered each other, right? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like, must have felt to decriminalizing homosexuals in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or do I have to meet with like minded people only in the dark of night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Will I be forced to become labour and hide their real beliefs? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> I have three years to come to seem like hell, full of persecutions and loneliness. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher at my college, not hiding his conservative views, was Norman stone, Professor of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He not only hated for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In college he almost didn&apos;t show up. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him for his provincialism, pettiness and adherence to Marxist-deterministskomu view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted the professorship position at the University of Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you will not be happy,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to ride in Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and friends of unbiased capital. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told the father that hate Oxford and explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He didn&apos;t believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his study in the forties there were any political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best University in the world,&quot; he said piteously. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> -There is not capable, not only in the dreamy spires ... </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes pomutneli. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Do not take hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You do break my heart if show University &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was debilitated by permanent missions in London and my emotional defense withered. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and abandoned their beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> Next week during a workshop when a history teacher seriously called me &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Soul burning with shame, I admitted that brainwashed me &quot;parents&quot;, and named them &quot;old fools&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to score my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time he wrote weekly columns for two newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I did not go, and five minutes later my pursuers had surrendered. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Can call me plaksoj and a rag. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation at school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only has released fourteen Tory Prime Ministers, but to this day, hidden behind the undeserved reputation of the University, which valued the equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: miners from Kawah-Idžena </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Four Indonesian miners euro risked life and limb, 70 kilos of sulphur had helping them to the top of the volcano on the steep rocky trails </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work is hell and others are literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them are Vijaya Anto, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur at Kawah-Idžen volcano, located in the East of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens when exposed to air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having broken away huge chunks of sulfur, total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, basket of charges on the shoulders and carries them up the steep rocky road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> To the top of the volcano which height is 55 meters, just 250 metres away, but movers require more Haggard 40 minutes to climb čerepaš′im step, hardly keeping balance and gently probing the road so as not to stumble and fall off a cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France, which foiled several years ago from rocks Kawah-Idžena. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners with 5 Kawah Idžena-earn euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which is mined </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus and, wearily carrying heavy baskets marched three kilometers to the weights that a mining company located just above, at an altitude of 1,850 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about FR Ngrimbi, Kandy venture that operates from 1960 onwards this volcano and, it is better not to say, their employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents), petrochemical industries, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for making matches, Fireworks, beauty products, dynamite and even to bleach sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As the norm is carrying 70 kilos, we earn around 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) per round trip,&quot; explained us Anto, who usually runs three daily carry. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels overwhelmed, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems minuscule to such an inhuman effort is three times more than what he would have earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Daily fee for miners is very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and is equal to the average monthly earnings of two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; said loader, who previously worked as a Mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> His salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto is back with his family in Ban′ûvangi, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as Sera: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where Hindus, and brought her to Java that it adopted Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, continually coughs and water eyes due to toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In its 27 years of Anto spent three years, risking a Idžene, sulfur-Kawah which has already started to affect him despite the masks and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, continually coughs and water eyes due to toxic gas, which earmarks a volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to achieve their dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Work two more years because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises on more than an acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> A disciplined life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, as a waiter or receptionist in hotel, but instead he performs work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at 2 a.m. because sulfur does not cease to flow out at night when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and glitters amongst the gloom. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shadows, Anto descends into a crater, illuminating the way the little lamp attached to his helmet, which he had bought for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Around 400 porters are pulling cart with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite high profits, mining company not mechanized mining of sulphur for cost savings and does not provide any equipment porters who work on their own account and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not even receive part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for the photograph, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards the reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work, and not for the people,&quot; said Badrusin, a chunky Porter, who spent 42 years on Kawah-Idžene three decades since leaving College. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he makes sure that the work will endure &quot;as much as I can,&quot; because he needed money for the education of their three children, ranging in age from 10 to 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Do not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burns your throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that none does not have any severe diseases. more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders, which deformed under the weight of the basket. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, only now Unajnik can raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his companions were 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano that three trucks transported to a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming distance in 18 kilometers along a narrow trail among the thickets. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;Don&apos;t retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; said Unajnik, a widely opening the mouth, which is missing a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works for mosquito control. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to the next is one of the toughest courses in the world: what are the human mules with Kawah-Idžena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for kids to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blamed career stress and house prices and the lack of education of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The People of Singapore, should grow up&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriot, you&apos;re my husband wife of Patriot, do our civic duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> May seem incredible that these lines are part of the peppermints, advertise tortillas but despite this – or perhaps because of it-this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of a rap, which uses local sayings like &quot;Let&apos;s put Bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to make fun of birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency that has made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its Creative Director, Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the power of music that people have &quot;a national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world for the reproduction of their own kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the Government had tried to do a lot of things, for example to launch a perfume with pheromones or organize parties dating fast (quick access). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but does not necessarily work. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why don&apos;t we do the creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 the child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not take this so lightly, so that the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $ 1,300 a year on United States policy to citizens &apos; enthusiasm for the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> State package for couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars, prolong maternity leave and tax credits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and its leadership to strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to the national population, currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Last time it was below 2-what is known as the substitution percentage-in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, Director of policy for couples and families, the national Office of population, said that the reason &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It&apos;s allowed people to have a wide range of options with regard to life&apos;s goals and priorities, in addition to a wedding and starting a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and postponing marriage and having children, resulting in decreased birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at drastically reducing immigration to counter the increase in population, causing outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites where barely-suppressed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and unwillingness to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party last year, Singapore was the worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem through higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While falling fertility is known to impact on the nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on medicine and politics of immigration, examples of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The Government is making efforts to build not only a small shelter. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, this is beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Guide to urban development was transferred to the control of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The apartment measures 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, it is believed that they may contribute to the idle position and lifestyle enabler developers who want to build a large family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yoo Sun, General Manager of the company&apos;s homebuilding EL Developers, said that their &quot;shoeboxes&quot; sold much faster than larger specimens. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these apartments are usually sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our revenues are increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he acknowledged that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who earlier put obstacles if they want to offer too many small flats in the project. </seg>

<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Mar′elos Porras, Professor of English and expert on education and training, believes that, in order to provide children and young people need to understand that the purpose of social networking-inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet as a tool for finding information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras said that the Academician Mark Prenski, a master of education from Yale University, and author of Digital Natives and immigrants who invented those terms to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives, they are children and young people who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still are learning,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that the subject is complicated, &quot;because we are asking them to have a certain criteria that you can or you cannot distribute, publish or speak when, at the age of maturity is not enough for that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also that they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking of the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show what is the confidentiality of children and adolescents-ask questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them that they did not do so, it is useless,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then He listed some options: there are things that you would tell a stranger, so why do you do it online? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, would you like it if you would have posted a photo like the one that you posted about her friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Did you know that others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign party photos, ask whether you allow other people to celebrate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another thing, all I need to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to let them understand that they must behave online just like do it offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;People outside the Internet behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles also should be in social networks,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, Professor of elementary education and educational consultant, explains the need for heads of families faithfully read the policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Realizing each of the items, they have good reason for talking to children about the preconditions of opening an account online. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Gaurdiâ, the key question is to remind the children the lesson &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality, which is the goal of &quot;South America, in this case, Yes, should learn from Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who has participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (unasur) held in Lima, Peru, told state television that &quot;the Europeans are killing each other during the second world war and in other clashes,&quot; but now they are practically one fatherland. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this context, a project establishing the South American citizenship, which endorsed the UNASUR member countries. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to ensure the free movement of workers and citizens to any South American country, as already happens with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,&quot; he cautioned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian President was, moreover, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who read lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South Americans, conversely, sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on human rights in Washington and is funded by the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured he does not regret the decision, because he has not betrayed its principles and comply with its &quot;deepest values of democracy and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that &quot;there was some suspicion that Assange be extradited to a third country and will not be respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticized Swedish Justice for demand to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sex crimes, while &quot;the Swedish law considers it possible to implement it by means of video conferencing, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I haven&apos;t talked to him since he arrived at our Embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian head of State. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> That really is, so is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of the confinement in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of every human being,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> CORREA said that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of guarantees of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, lies in the hands of UK, Sweden and European judiciary and stressed that there were talks in London on the search for solutions to the problem of confinement of the WikiLeaks founder. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We are not holding talks on human rights, that&apos;s a word we don&apos;t use here, but there were constant discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution is in the hands of UK, Sweden and European judicial organs, because Assange lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, has a number of processes in the various European institutions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And expressed the view that &quot;If the United Kingdom tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden as it is allows its legislation and as it had done in other cases, Assange would be questioned in the Embassy of Ecuador Señora in London or questioned him on Skype tomorrow this will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took advantage of the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that abhors &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The main enemies of press freedom is not spoiled the villains-and bad journalists, capable plunder, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect, he remains satisfied that none of these journalists, &quot;neither bankers nor a bourgeois country-gegemony does not prevail in Ecuador&quot; and added that being reelected, &quot;deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also backed the decision to retain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR, at least until the next election, arguing that the Organization &quot;must be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups in the guise of legality&quot;, because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian President also felt &quot;absolutely justified&quot; to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to lead negotiations with Nicaragua now on maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment the decision is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome to go along. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed hope for a good end of the maritime boundary dispute, which is conducted by the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed that &quot;the right thing for Latin America to appeal to international courts, if the two countries agree to take a decision, no matter how difficult it may be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> About to speak as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that considering this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although this is sometimes pretty hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa pledged that if he lost the election in February 2013, then withdrew from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal note, I&apos;ve never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic, poverty can be corrected only by political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement was of the opinion that it was likely that I guaranteed a victory, so we must acknowledge this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If you win, this would be my last term of Office of the President, and then we go out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This decision,&quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new treatment course of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to a treatment that has already been scheduled, routine, and that it is expected that he will miss a campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean the deterioration of the health status of President Chavez,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Head of the Ecuadorian State has participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS mortality today are the result of late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years when he announced that his analysis on AIDS, gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;Me as if slapped,&quot; he recalls the difficult, despite the doctor&apos;s time quantum. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid this from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> To cope with the disease himself, he wanted to learn about her as much as possible. And his efforts were justified-he has already marked its 43 anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; of HIV patients Hospital Department Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, the year after overcoming many obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He is living with a diagnosis of &quot;human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is already 22 years. In the early 90 &apos;s, it would be hard to believe-then there were too few treatment options, too little is known about the disease, patients were too biased. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even so, clinic Director of the Mexican Institute of social security did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had a cut&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days to have AIDS were sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it&apos;s possible to survive with this syndrome and to do so without compromising the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of their disease, until now, many people are coming, when the virus has already damaged, &quot;exhaustion&quot; of their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, the &quot;great achievement at this point is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time, and survival in the general population is exactly the same,&quot; said head of the HIV Department of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information has been confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Physician and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the researchers concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system of the patients with early diagnosis, the better the life expectancy of those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years, with the number 200 CD4 and up to 50 yearsWhen a reported 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to those terms, &quot;maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess this progress, it should be remembered that Mexicans &apos; life expectancy today averages 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality has declined considerably in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from the year 2007 to 6.678 4.862 in year 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of Aids, 60 percent of the patients died in a national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in the year 2011 and already registered 187 deaths by May this year; However, it is argued that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs by 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> -Why there are still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> -Personally I think that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I myself represent, such is the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the past 12 years, we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because the infected are not aware of their status, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He cited disastrous statistics: &quot;nine out of ten patients have come when an opportunistic infection; What should I do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so this diagnosis at an earlier stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who asked for it. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal, agree experts and officials of the State Council AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who appealed for screening in a private laboratory, the pobuždennyj simply because it made him a friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered high cancer, Sarcoma, which is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think they will die, and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Time to die, better still I&apos;ll nadirat′sâ three times per week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I do eat well, exercise, take your medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents only know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I&apos;m working, I have a lot of classes, I&apos;m traveling, am sexually active, but with mutual responsibility, take care of yourself and the other person,&quot; listed a Fabrizio, who agreed to share her private life with MILENIO JALISCO to catalyze their own statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let them be tested if there was risk of infection as soon as possible, let them know whether they are HIV-positive is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them learn they can live like any other human being, as responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This is his message sums up the theme of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Great divide between programmes in the areas of health and the simple citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who took issue related to HIV. </seg>

<seg id="2828"> In view of the ratification of the United States Court of appeal decision, which cancels the debt restructuring Group Vitro reached through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the script sets the precedent for the fateful any national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country, which has a solvency problem. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms that allowed Mexican laws are not valid in the country bands and stars, in violation of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, approval of the June 15 decision by a judge in the Court of Hale Harlin bankruptcy Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firms face possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> But the decision opens the door to a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico for treatment in the United States Supreme Court, citing the testimony of three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> By way of introduction, while judge case notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerning bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law was created by the unification of international trade law, by defining as referee American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the verdict establishes that, without a vote, recognized the intercompany in critical mass debt bankruptcy proceedings which were before the parent company, Vitro subsidiaries would not have achieved the majority required for approval of restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, this ability to recognize Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme was adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are a half-dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose business debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting votes one way or another, Vitro, who had fought the lenders against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds &quot;vultures&quot; like Aurelios Capital Aurelios, Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Limited Liverpool, would not have reached majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> It would be 45 percent of the vote against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The Court of appeal omits. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses Vitro in a difficult situation, which it has had since the year 2008, affected by a severe economic crisis that struck the United States on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> So far the family firm Gonzalez Sada can appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to vote came to its plenary, that is, five judges, in view of the fact that only three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In case of failure would petition for certification, which would require a review process by the Court of first instance, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2846"> In addition, it is noted that the country must respect the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, i.e., the rules established for inter-State cases of insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for the debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> An avid basketball traveler Hector &quot;Hetin &apos;&apos; Reyes has been more than 60 years is associated with that sport and, thanks to him, has traveled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico remembers so much basketball stories like Hector &quot;Hetin &apos;&apos; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And yet before brain haemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in the year 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, the highest Basketball League player, the Commissioner and the head of BSN with Cowboys and Baâmona President of the basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have performed many roles in basketball during his lifetime, including several at the same time, both when I was President of BSN, General Manager of the national team and President of the Federation in the 90-ies&quot;, recalls Reyes Primera Hora, during a visit to his home in Baâmon, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabel, for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is not exaggerating, making this allegation. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, nearly all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected during its long journey, bear witness to this. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Baâmon in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys since the mid 50 &apos;s, as a player until 1982, when the age of 15 years, his performances in the role of agent or agent&apos;s contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;Those were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Championships of the year 1967 with the Cowboys, as an agent, the agent or Manager. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of joy, including five Championships since 1971 to 1975 year. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one year in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, and continue to lead became &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have for you there is a very strong player, rising 6′7″.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Want Some?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who were in Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommend a sniper who received the Gauss Raymond citizenship and become one of our best scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that said that if the Minsi brought Baâmonu champion, Gauss would win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> With the Cowboys winning the Launchers I enjoyed, but already at a distance because the year 1988 was head of the Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I preferred to enjoy its achievements and accomplishments of the Minsi in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember how we won for the first time at the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the year 1990 FIFA World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was to be a bronze if not for the Canadian judge, who made the final game to beat us, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team from the 1990 World Cup, is the best team you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the Olympics 2004 year. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the United States national team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze medal at the World Championships. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team not only played again Minsi, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and &apos; Pikulin &apos; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &apos; Ton′ito &apos; Colon and James Carter, Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &apos; Quijote &apos; Morales, who was unable to participate in a 90 year due to a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team that was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but the gold medal has brought us great joy, and has been the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament of the year 1995 in Argentina, Neuquen. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> The role players like &apos; Kanito &apos; N′evesa, Pablo Rolando Alisea and young players in return, Hurruitnera, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan American Championship Mar del Plata, we won gold, contrary to all forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, this was Pikulin Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His impressive performance at international tournaments. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has not dominated at that level, as did Pikulin. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this is without taking account of his career in various leagues in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Puèrtorikancem who was the best leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a very difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good youngsters, including Julio Toro, Melendez Carlos Morales, Flora, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> From young, I really like the work of Leo Arilly. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you think your greatest achievement in the Federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90-ies in the BSN was up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you have left to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now guys travel and play too much, and it&apos;s unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruits of obligatory certification and course for managers, executives and umpires. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I mostly listen to music, watch music videos on YouTube of my era, enjoying their grandchildren and occasionally go on basketball matches. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel′, who was always with me. </seg>

<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore the apocalyptic events, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, the Professor of religion Stewart Sharma decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew he had the irresistible bait: the end of the &quot;long count&quot; calendar of the Maya, 21 December, during which many people have seized upon as proof that the coming end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane sandy, the financial crisis, which some call &quot;dolgoarmageddonom&quot;, and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian end times theorists believed that the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that this would be the most apocalyptic of all semester,&quot; said Sharma, this week&apos;s Rutgers-Camden University students (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what is happening in the world now, as if we have only 30 days, it was a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember, bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he&apos;s not the only professor who offers courses on &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory, last in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Templ′skom University Associate Professor Barry Wacker reads the course &quot;media, culture and the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week students will explore topics such as the apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why these ideas are spread over time,&quot; he said, and the way that offer the hypothetical scenarios that cause certain deeds of a person. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students analyze movies on apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell students that may probably believable and impossible,&quot; said Wacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania history professor Latin American Matthew Restall and his counterpart Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to find the course that is simply called &quot;end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We don&apos;t add &apos; 2012 &apos; to always be able to read the course again, in case the end of the world will not come,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent destruction&quot;, students should learn, prepare draft and pass the final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> Penn State in the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse that leaves no students have no choice but to work &quot;until the night of the alleged end of the world,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses proved to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Places are over two hours,&quot; said Restall its course for students with the highest average score, at which 35 students were enrolled. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We were getting e-mails for many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked, are there any other places. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, in turn, certify that this course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I like to watch people do to comfort ourselves,&quot; said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology of Haddonfilda, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will 25-year-old Wekesa, a student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all of apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard about the course, which is taught,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I love it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the surveyed students-not to mention the professor said he had believed in the doomsday date December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first draft raised the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student last year in Templ′skom University of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; It&apos;s just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he said there is concern apokaliptičeskoe in the Western culture, which dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places, people don&apos;t think about it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Predominantly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, Professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly replied when asked if he knew of any course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; out there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, alluding to the higher court. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that for a long time on many days of the last judgment, and said that if anything will happen on December 21, &quot;people immediately begin to think about the next date&quot; or philosophize that December 21 is the start of a seven-year period, after which the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and faculty are blithely by that date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Some said they were going to go for the &quot;end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe someone will call out friends to laugh together,&quot; said Samira Ford, 20-year-old student of the Faculty of communication. </seg>
