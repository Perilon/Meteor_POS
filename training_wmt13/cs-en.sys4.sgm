<seg id="1"> The Republican Party against Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justify its policy necessary to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> brennanovo centre, a scam called the myth that electoral fraud is less frequent than the number of people who die in the US after a lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Republican lawyers, after all, for the last 10 years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of America&apos;s democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada have responsibility for the federal elections of individual states in the US. </seg>
<seg id="8"> and in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 has been the new laws, which make it difficult to process the elections or the electoral list. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, it was only 180 proposals submitted for 2011, the law limiting the right in 41 States. </seg>
<seg id="11"> new election laws require voters to submit a photo ID and proof of American state citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, zneplatňují right to be listed on the list of voters on the day of elections and odnímají electoral law citizens in its criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> before the elections in 2006 did not require the electorate documents půkazu photo ID no US state. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The first state to introduce this request was Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="15"> constitutionality indianského law confirmed the US Supreme Court in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities spěchaly with the expansion of the procedure and to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The proposals in the last two years have such laws in 34 States to force voters to give identity cards with photographs. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It should be noted that, unlike quebeku American citizens do not have universal identity card, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, owns 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no passport photo ID issued by the government by their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, there is no such an identity card about five million new voters in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Moreover, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions will disproportionately affect mainly young, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years so it does not have the required photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the students, who are known as voters in their turn to democratic candidates in several States are not entitled to use their identity card with the photos of their school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same States allow Members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote more Republican candidates, card issued these clubs used in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, require no state in election proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The first such request by Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> from 2011, about 12 States laws which sets out to show the voters that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic community. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Republican legislativci support laws in eight states that the minutes of the day of elections in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, the right of individuals and groups to provide aid to limit the voters who want to write. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during general elections in 2004 helped campaign for the minutes of the electorate to zaregistrování around 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken in 2009 but has caused a decline in the process of adding new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Republican lawmakers, in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of the electorate who voted for in advance, although afroamerických was only 13% of voters in that state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> for Hispanics, it was the same. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of people who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the other hand, whites who, 76% of all voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted for in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> against the pass laws that limit the registration of voters, of course, very strongly up the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> democratic governors blocked its veto several draft laws. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In order to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Some of them managed to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, laws requiring photo identification, only 16 of the 34 States. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The newly introduced rules, however, is undeniably difficult in 2012, the performance of the voting rights. </seg>
<seg id="48"> democratic critics talk mainly about bias approved laws and they are seen as the obvious attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report brennanova centre of 2011 shows that states where these laws were passed, are 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary for victory in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain already: this new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of America&apos;s democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The detection of prostate cancer: an investigation or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> the dog to sometimes wrong results, which have been negative or even misimplemented positive, leading to unnecessary medical zákrokům. </seg>
<seg id="55"> All of this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already reluctant to investigate at all to go. </seg>
<seg id="56"> to be investigated or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked for the opinion of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> in the studies carried out in the US has shown high levels of contamination between testovanými groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the noted the different mortality among patients who are running the investigation, and those on them did not go. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also demonstrated after 12letém distance, that those who do not go to the investigation are about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastáz. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend the investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men are also at greater risk of the African-American origin. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers, such species, which are inert. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Therefore, it is essential that the right to explain the patient&apos;s level of the dangers of his kind of cancer, it can offer alternatives neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and focus more on active surveillance of the disease in these cases. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, who was diagnosed with cancer cure, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive and threatens the life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer them more of the active supervision and in the case of progrese offering the treatment of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more often and with greater accuracy set out the criteria, which help in deciding which type of treated and which do not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Yet so I recommend to the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="70"> It is important to interview with the doctor and the investigation to determine whether it is appropriate to take or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international urologickou companies a movement movember tool that allows you to evaluate for and against in connection with vyšetřením dog. </seg>

<seg id="73"> disease prevention </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risks of the principles of a healthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently hýbali, up to 30% of cases of cancer could be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If we all stop smoking, this figure rose to at least 50%,&quot; underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian society for cancer research. </seg>
<seg id="78"> By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Some percentage of also remains totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> for the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers has fallen. </seg>
<seg id="81"> cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> They are also the risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is extremely harmful to human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;even today is in quebeku 1.5 million smokers,&quot; kroutí head spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> encouraging figure: 10 years after kuřák stop smoking, the risk of cancer death falls by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> tělnatost and obesity are under SCC another risk factor for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancers of the esophagus, slinivky and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; the report adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommended to reduce the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It is appropriate to avoid uzenin, for that is the same. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat uzením, drying or solením can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;they can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; the report adds. </seg>
<seg id="96"> vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent times, the various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="99"> studies on vitamin E, according to SCC contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Although, according to one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, Other studies talk more about the increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly established. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and precedentech from families with their doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;to the investigation does not mean that you have cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> higgsův boson examined </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the likely discovery higgsova bosonu justified concern raised last summer. </seg>
<seg id="106"> There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model - our best or the &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of nature and behavior of matter - but that has not been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> between physics, however, is not yet 100% certainty that higgsův boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to higgsovu bosonu as předpovězen standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> new data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto, but rather the lack of it, all the data in order to have an absolute certainty. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose, however, that this is a higgsův boson, since the risk of error seems small, and look at what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world is undeniably a law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise, ublížíte. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although it is částicová physics very strange world, it also shows that it is a similar law: off exclusionary principle, under which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;kvantovém status&quot; - the &quot;state of&quot; roughly speaking, some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> further divided fyzikové particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony obediently follow off principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> and at the other end of the range bosony, podlí anarchists, who are nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that may well be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the equipment (by the way, absolutely wonderful), which is the particle adventure in Berkeley Labs: mesony unnoticed, which we leave here,&quot; and &quot;power of particles, which is a natural forces and with which is higgsův boson probably somehow spřízněn. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be said, however, that these bosony are so exotická that, as it can be to believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If this article read, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banalitou: fotonu, or &quot;particle of light,&quot; which is &quot;a proponent of&quot; electromagnetic forces. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When the particles with electric nábojem quicker or change its direction,&quot; Cancel &quot;the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like oblázek thrown into a lake. </seg>
<seg id="122"> from this &quot;intervention&quot; will create electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave of nothing more than fotonem - and thus one of the bosonů, &quot;by force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> It is also with higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference that &quot;vyrušit&quot; needs to be the other higgsovo field that this boson discovered. </seg>
<seg id="125"> This higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excitaci is to be achieved very high energy values, as with the frozen pond levels already zčeří just a great rock. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For this reason, it is to be used as a huge urychlovač part as urychlovač in laboratory CERN - great hadronový urychlovač friendly ties is a circle with district 27 km! - in order to develop the energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field once again suited to clarify the relationship between higgsem and matter. </seg>
<seg id="128"> with the electromagnetic field do not, in fact, not all particles, all materials. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, do so, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be from himself to ledničce. </seg>
<seg id="130"> and the same is true, that with higgsovým field do not all particles: those that do have a matter, while others (such as foton, let us look at it) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> and Mrs nováková asks what all of these studies are what &quot;will bring us?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="132"> From the point of view of science is a confirmation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to bend of any discrepancy between observation and forecasts SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Many physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space &quot;new physics&quot; and close some of the loopholes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It is to say that the model still has huge problems, there are no clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of space (again ouha!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> facilities but CERN has such contradictions there. </seg>
<seg id="136"> response </seg>
<seg id="137"> The response of the research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs novákových can find it difficult to predict, a mistake, however, would have to believe that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> hleďte: right at the beginning of the 1960s not průkopníci laser in low-level language features laboratories no revolution, will have their work. </seg>

<seg id="733"> products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many low-wage workers in stores Walmart buys only for themselves at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> In the words of critics can Walmart to sell goods cheaply partly because few pay their staff. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic wheelchairs or small scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The demonstrators on &quot;black Friday,&quot; called for an increase in salaries and they complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies have risen sharply from 30 to $100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical worker WalMart receives $9.5 per hour, but it is not in the level of spending, say employees. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Walmart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on the salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If the company WalMart shifts wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit to the state by only 46 cents more. </seg>

<seg id="744"> Defenders of society WalMart point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage. </seg>

<seg id="749"> protests continued this week in New York, where their aim not trade houses Walmart (those in the pokrokovém city are not very popular, and that is why we are almost), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other types of restaurant. </seg>

<seg id="757"> Few people see in that its main source of livelihood or plans to remain there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> At the moment, they constantly in an interview with the workers &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; who complain that the money must live and sometimes even to feed their children from them. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how you feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday for &quot;mcdonalda&quot; 40th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash register and all businesses fast food began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> also called for trade unions to be based in the realm of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American laws forbid the administration to defend the establishment of trade unions and to punish the activists of the trade union movement bullying and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> from the other side of them, rarely making life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> introduce businesses fast food trade unions, however, is difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main reasons is extremely high employee turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> opposition </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day, noisy protests were held in many other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action was at the Assembly in &quot;mcdonalda&quot; near Times Square, where there were few local democratic politicians, particularly member of the city council jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; says that sells billions of, and then you or not with sick leave and not you properly for your serious work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators have seen the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the town of bill de blasio, who said that &quot;we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair compensation for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> as described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of America&apos;s sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though far from all of them were employees of fast food in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Whether this event will be the spark that zažehne fire mass movement, is still unclear. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;so far are brain mislead on average&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The reality is a popular topic among fans of the modern technology of virtual reality; it means seeing the world in recent times, particularly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> In the early years at its annual conference showed Google working model of this news and in November, it was announced that the patent application by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> from an interview with a group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft\ xC5 aramem izadim shows that the glasses for this company scientists are already a thing of the past. </seg>
<seg id="777"> attracts is the prospect of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Please tell us aware of the framework of the deals with your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are dealing with interakcemi man machine, but at the same time, we are trying to move beyond this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> humanity has yet at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, most sometimes affects screen finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want vyhlížet in 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, konzola Xbox and sensors kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without scanning kinect, because for all the management is very interesting gestural. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what is still ahead of us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - despite the fact that the system kinect extended interaction on the physical level, there is still a lot of interaction on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The flow of information to improve the system, greater amounts of data, but the flow has not particularly. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, we are working on really trojrozměrných display systems based on the various technologies including projektivních. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is important to allow computer world in our physical world, do it more real. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the room around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to add to the real world, the virtual objects in much better form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> and in the first place - to hell with those silly helmami virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about hlasovém control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> This is a popular thing, but nepřeceňuje? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - surely it cannot be seen as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, not because we always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their activities and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we had a project for the control equipment in public places in which we think about gesture politics, but not on rozmáchlých only on such skoupých, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> gestures while nesnímala camera equipment, but náramkem, to monitor the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> So far, it is great, but in theory it can reduce the size of náramkových watches. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In general, however, that the future is a mixed type of control, for example, a + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - and how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> How, I ask, for example, to give you this can limonády? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You tell it and at the same time ukážete. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just simply talking. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - oh, that will be very difficult to identify. </seg>
<seg id="804"> So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - it is not necessary, but it is the convergence. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more precisely to the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors that provide a good depth of distinction, that is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox kinect, what are your demands on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Today is not sufficient distinction, the depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - in fact, the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to speed of 1000 F/8 megapixels. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not just about the megapixely, but as a nut and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> While the views of all current technologies are inadequate for us - přidělává work designérům algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So we need to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and y axes, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> So, the speed is very important, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> human movement is a dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, are a bit of a little, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen betishes of our laboratory in redmondu did dotykový scanner with nastavitelným processing delays of 1 to 100 Ms, and the current sériově produced sensors are closer to the other ($60-100 Ms). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much this affects human interaction with the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For me, the work would be very useful equivalent of such facilities, but I do not need so much dotyků, but I need some extra images per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - and increasing the number of cameras is not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - in the system kinect are now used three &quot;cameras,&quot; one of which is in fact range transmitter and the second person - odraženého signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> and a third camera - that is, in fact, a scanner visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> more cameras could potentially solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> or worsen it, because it increased the necessary volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create flexible analog system kinect, pohrát the zakřivením Hochzeitslocation cameras and see how it will help in determining the 3D location. </seg>
<seg id="827"> If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not presented publicly their glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, when it comes to the daily use of technology the reality with special glasses, this is one of the nejslibnějších platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course - to keep the hold smatphone in zdvižených hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be &quot;transferable&quot; form of reality, when it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds switch at any time of the glasses on the smartphone, screen display, and round and round. </seg>
<seg id="830"> glasses - this is a very personal equipment, that is their strength (private things you can see only you), and, at the same time, the weakness - the reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual buildings at the same time with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holografickými objects in the air is available not only Tony starkovi in &quot;iron man,&quot; but also normal smrtelníkovi. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one issue on which critics often point: there is no dotyková response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> hand feels nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - in their přednáškách often say that the reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the tactile vjemů could well become the eighth breakthrough. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So far, the use of one of the interesting tricks - using the other hand as a kind of paper for display. </seg>
<seg id="838"> in an excellent manner, drive down! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding hmatatelnosti these &quot;lines in the air&quot; - for example, the country several směrových ultrasonic X-rays ranging in defined point, where the finger is a tactile feel, but it is still very weak - as if you foukal on bříška fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also a wrist strap on the wrist, which affects nerve conclusion in the fingers - also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - have you tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> to think that feel what appears to be that he should feel at the moment when they see something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - it is a good idea, we have not yet nezkoušeli. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that will fight for a long time - how to make a man who is physically located in very stísněném area, to believe that is open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not in clubs such as), moving platforms and also huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> If the deception of the brain becomes, it is still work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in the very beginning. </seg>

<seg id="1001"> \ xC5 head nkú: control švarcsystému failed because of politicians </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has good supervisors in relation to public procurement and the quality of the legislation, but is lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In an interview for aktuálně.cz says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;the law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing,&quot; comments on the current situation kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Similar conclusions also suggests the control of Czech and German controllers. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practice says approach Peter nečase to so-called &quot;švarcsystému.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS is not entrepreneurs bother his controls - so it is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;the law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the obligations,&quot; notes kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The audit committee in the House, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, in which the was porovnávána procurement legislation in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was specifically? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> The parallel control that we have launched about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Put simply, that the legislation is how to deal with public procurement, followed by the national legislation and then also the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have all of this together, and even if the control is not yet closed, we have very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps &quot;stricter and better for us,&quot; however, the practice is better in some parameters in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It is, therefore, that it is not enough to create still further and further more precise rules, but must be given to the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can help you in this project, what does this mean for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is the kind of control could contribute to the effort to stop spending on specifying the laws, reducing and improvement of limits when it has a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> economy means to obtain appropriate thing for a reasonable (which is not always the lowest price) to rule out enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But, by reducing the limit orders, that we should not necessarily achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may be that the system zahltí such a &quot;paper&quot; that those who want to find holes in the system, so they will benefit from this much more easily than if the limit is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about domestic problems with other words transferring public procurement legislation into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar our nkú, or is it set in? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for the authorities, as nkú there is bundesrechnungshof, which is organised as we also has the College, is only slightly differently, but essentially both authorities doing likewise. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the Court of Auditors and at the level of the Länder - that is the system a bit different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> brh federal money with us can only control of state resources. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> public funds, which are managed by us and the communities, there is the control of the level of federal courts of auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the legislation, so it is easier than our? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I would without concrete data to the situation, however, in some ways, Germany is described as a model, but certainly not to say that it is all the better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so even by the supervisors have better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Certainly not, but, again, I do not like such a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it has to be said that the countries which we consider to be a model, are faced with a number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise it has no benefit for them to work together with our office, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As for the domestic legislation that, for your office meant the amendment to the law on public procurement, are already evident in its effects? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the duration of the amendment is relatively short, so we still not in control of events. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Because we do control ex post, is the need to count on a delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We see this not only in the process of preparing the future controls - nastartovali we have our new tool &quot;risk detection inefficiencies,&quot; through which we prohnali almost 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed - there is the change of course will show, because the conditions will change the limits to amend certain types of the selection process and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The adoption of this law, do you see more for benefits, or the additional burden of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem here may be that she &quot;rewrite the rules&quot; and it will not be possible to honour them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> for the previous rules are controlled people committed to the provider (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) to each of the public procurement law is a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> So is the cost of the law in this way; eventually? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want it to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct that does not affect the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> and how out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us show, where the road is not. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs will not bother the controls of the so-called &quot;švarcsystému&quot; - and what it means? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> \ xC5 varcsystém is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the requirement. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> can say: &quot;We will change the law and we allow this,&quot; but cannot say that we are going to do anything like that. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> in the public procurement law are quite strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is the right to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But on the other hand, it is tragic when those with the best offer is out of the question for the formal shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing. </seg>

<seg id="1132"> for school students jedličkova regularly are running out of instructors and address them in the activities of the constitution, which is entertaining and are interested in. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> the students themselves do not have the means to be taken for lecturers ourselves, we are trying to allow them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In regards the construction of jedličkova constitution in the future there will be a separate building with this project in which we transfer. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> on each koncertě floor several musical groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what you picked? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will speak Chinaski support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the tap tap Marián bango and George dry. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> you are planning a similar &quot;bombastické action &apos;in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here we certainly an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In the next year we would also like to zahráli in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, as we would like it has in the US, with speeches in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have spoken out, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is, however, the group, which is made up of disabled people. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> As these trips zvládáte logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as terrible as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five Members on the electrical wheelchair, its cars to travel in zavazadlovém area, also, of course, faced with vláčíme large quantities of cargo and beden instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, has always performed without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us were well prepared, I often wondered up. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to výjezdům abroad can compare how different the individual in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What you have met? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just seen in Russia in the East, that is all still in full beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> The Prague Moscow is very bariérová, here it is still unusual for one to an electrical wheelchair he instituted in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There is not even a self-evident, as that to be wheelchair users should do you prefer in the lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are also civil unions, which is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> and what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are plenty of things in which we are still behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that better and improving the situation is always dependent on the aspirations of the people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> in London and Madrid is perfectly normal that people with a heavy hendikepem of moving to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not the usual power that there would be a lot of people with disabilities a more active part in social life, here we are, with the tap tap a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be leading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, and things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The band of tap tap is very popular at the moment to come back a couple of years back what you in 1998 led to establish it? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I came as vychovatel to jedličkova constitution, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to address. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> and as I myself muzikant, hraji including saxofon and I, along with my colleague iniciator zájmový music circle. </seg>

<seg id="1174"> This is the logical way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> The things that are unique, there is very little, but I venture to say that tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, is, of course, sorry, this is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the sympathy is totally unnecessary, because people with hendikepem no suffering all abandoned beings, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that when something in people with hendikepem, so this is not the only for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> to this success, that you have a strict boss, as you said that many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do good work, we need to be tough on many issues and require a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think this is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic notion and head in the clouds, and when they discover that must twice a week to go to the test, be on the product and spend a lot of time on your concerts, it is the enthusiasm quickly leave. </seg>

<seg id="1240"> It is important to mention Poland&apos;s entry into cosparu (Committee for space research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee cospar two years later. </seg>

<seg id="1242"> repeal of the law on public work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court of law on public work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution triggered a lively debate in public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Certainly it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> liberal oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, is in the permanent conflict between us. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause is the principle of free trade and free of unrestrained movement of private capital, along with unrestrained financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> due to significant price differences work, wages) There are price tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is the need to understand the situation, when producers are trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition by &quot;podrazí&quot; price competitor with an aim to shoulder a greater share of the market and thus increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> on a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or they buy cheaply, or zaniknout.výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared with other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> because private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it vyprodukovanou unemployment, are necessarily the social costs of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The situation underscores the absolute reluctance by businesses to pay taxes and replace it with economic and social a social damage done in pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so widely known that there is no need to include specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> the unscrupulous practices of private capital different economies are in a situation where national governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of its people in order to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments, private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly in changes of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is economically to force their own population adopted a diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of workers in the area of employment rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between the rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In srn exist for a number of years public výdejny food for the poor, who cannot make a living from their work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the increasing competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a wage that they must pay to the state subsistence. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> This scandal was published, and in the case of the auxiliary staff Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> austerity measures in all the southern states inevitably lead to the same situation when people are under pressure from the catastrophic decline in social standards forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or živořit for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might again come the private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> There is a need to hear but where it comes from? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If this is from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, brazilec or Turk, marokánec or Egyptian or African would still work for a fraction of the salaries. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies across Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and media ad nauseam argue that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital for insisting on the position that the state must not managing interventions to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then we need to ask whether private equity do not affect, it is now policy and the state in their own egoistickém sense. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> There is a clear answer that yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of virtually powerful and ubiquitous in all States lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption in the area of providing those benefits, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In srn situation is such that the State Department for lack of money commissioning a draft law private legal firms, which are frequently in conjunction with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These amendments are then agreed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> all the power in this way does not come from people as they claim the constitution of the Western type, but financially strong groups preferujících own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that as the liberal democracy is now quickly get into the situation, as it describes appiános in their work in the crisis of the Roman Republic caesara and pompeia: &quot;the state has been long in the decay and authorities obsazovaly violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> for bribes, illegal obtaining good graces and with stones or swords. </seg>

<seg id="1281"> Finally, as well as in antice is the current society based on reckless preference their own benefit regardless of celospolečenský interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not inherently unable to understand and apply celospolečenský benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform the deeper nature. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> kauzalitu the fascist and Communist regimes so we have found in the reckless economic liberalisation of the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> for the current state of the demise of these systems can be in favour of a liberal democracy, such as a break with the expectations of the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> particularly disastrous is completely ignore the fact that the elite in the future possible statisícové loss of life, the humanitarian and social disaster, which we have now seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both on the international and European level of interior of the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms to strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favour of the state. </seg>

<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen szaboa that Berlin is close to the edge of diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, signalled that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained from the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen szabo: Germany doesn&apos;t support what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, however, the Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I think, that will not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained during the vote, when it comes to establishing a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Here, in the end, pushed through NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy away from the policy, which was run by the US, as it were, in the direction of German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are between two lines. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think the role of the only have taken hold, but they are on the road to more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> In foreign policy, as they do in France or in the UK. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> what specifically is &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> shows preparedness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I think that the German foreign policy, economic policy is motivated, export and its relations with some areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why it must be careful to neodstrašilo public, but not the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> I would not like this but not to give too much of it is not completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In any case, it plays an important role in German thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> damaged Germany&apos;s relations with the US, when Germany in the case of both important decision-making abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that in Europe, and even in the US there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not think that it was as dramatic as a watershed in the issue of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany are extracted some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It signals that must be considered as an international player and its interests have to be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The US, in contrast, clearly expressed for the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the US and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These differences have always existed as a result of the internal policy. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration has some secret by a great deal of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But as a result of the political situation cannot hold this position, of course, publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think that differences of opinion are not really as great as always seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not at all happy with any power netanjahuovou policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is exactly what the Germans difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> for the Germans, of course, would be a bit easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from its own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Yet this is precisely what they are doing with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> It was always a sensitive topic. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think it is clear that the Germans must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself as a major international player? wants to take the role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still accustomed to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country is still difficult to play a greater role for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> When, for example, look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role for protiněmecké mood. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> do not that the Germans facilitate. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It is, in fact, the old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be acceptable to all neighbours and views and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> US influence in European politics now is constantly falling, however, the EU this vacuum currently nevyplňuje. who is otherwise there? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like them is unpleasant and it will be even more neoblíbenějšími - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>

<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is a law of the jungle. </seg>

<seg id="1673"> Last year was ctmo delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than 2010. </seg>

<seg id="2193"> and to complicate relations with some of its leaders want to and some of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reconnect with diasporou. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans work for Mexico as &quot;provisional ambasadoři&quot; and they were the Mexican interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American citizens, how great it is to visit the country, and push for political leaders to forge relations with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> No. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This is not so. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> too many hostile feeling. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> and thanks to income inequality and a widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not certain that this is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I have a feeling that it is up to you, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States to act with Mexico before one and a half century and must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation for the way in which it was discussed with members of their family in considerably closer to the past. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> We may be more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battles, the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such case was in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Among the usual unnecessary guesses as to who started, many buildings have been changed in the rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and, for the first time the rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But even if it appears that Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are zachyceni in nastalém chaos in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will mean that their fight will be even krvavější than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that this could break their deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war, which is neither vyhraná or a lost. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems that, at present, there are many reasons for optimizmu. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a cease-fire reached 21 November vydrželo fight this week strengthened hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, while Gaza has suffered defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and rate of 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the planet, with Israel nor Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, which is currently managed by the Palestine, his are ardent rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may very well decide that time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Islamists across the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has added to the Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic Crescent spans around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where a party/militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> and, above all, on the southern end of Israel&apos;s changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammad mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, secular tyrant, who ruled for 30 years until its collapse in Egypt in 2011, not time on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the contrary, the Brotherhood is bratrancem Hamas and its leaders are more ovlivnitelní public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future the Hamas diplomacy can appear as a player, which cannot be ruled out Israel or America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terminology was Hamas stored back into boxes. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s anti-missile system iron kopule proved their worth and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> the Israelis can sleep better - for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic language is America, unfailing as always, many European countries also vinyl Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> and in particular - Israel to prosper, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has mostly ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively calm in Israel from the suicide bomb bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which is the Palestinian state in the West Bank, the main part of what may be the one, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are growing despite its protiprávnost against international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the start of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January merged with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why by those proradné Palestinians by giving them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If it really ruled in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better if we keep them for the walls and praštíme is when vystrčí heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will have won, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israeli defence spending is higher than spending all his four Arab neighbours together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> the launch of a new war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab remember to heal him its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The fact that President mursí worked with President Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire is a good sign and can be the beginning of something new. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> also the Israelis should look at the situation in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, a denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination is the keg, which must one day burst in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus, which exploded in Tel Aviv last week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> at the time of the repression of democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of the situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to drive Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need incentives from the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is what think reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two States, when Israel went territory for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In the short term, there is little chance that the cease-fire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence to push this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar have to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs outside must also push for the agreement between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the immediate offer virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In his first term zanedbal presentation of its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Now, back in the White House, seems to be equally zdráhavý in its entry in the process. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is woefully short-sighted. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws came into force in Australia means cigaretových packaging </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The nevzhledných green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are depicted warning for smokers and sick of the body. </seg>

<seg id="2268"> While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> tobacco companies claimed that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and dostupnějším cigaretám. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;with this legislation will be serious unintentionally consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of the society of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> counterfeiters from China and Indonesia přivezou much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Another claim that laws have increased their shops. </seg>

<seg id="2275"> ha said that society zico sold almost 6 000 units wholesale dealers and expects new supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> Trade is good for us. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Experts cite the popularity of social media as a possible setback for the demographic groups plan to focus on that. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring a majority of retailers to cigarettes from direct view of tobacco marketing moved online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia banned Internet advertising, local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites. </seg>

<seg id="2281"> Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, of &quot;average honzou.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We have to ask, is this just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes marlboro and gave the work and created this video, or marketing company is involved in this? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focused on how to use the new regulations than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far that paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack - the new regulations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly not. sold </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The Court decision soo is expected in the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Minister plibersek says that the government had held talks with other governments, who are considering similar laws on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The stricter laws they think Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia is resisting. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images do not have any effect on me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> simply ignoruji. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;just think you pull out a cigarette and Box strčíte back,&quot; says Victor el hage when buying packs with photographs of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, it is just one reason to stop smoking, and this is my small dcerka. </seg>

<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should simply is completely banned, then we say, OK, this is the end, we close shop &apos;,&quot; he said and rozhodil hands. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In the world of the Internet is not so bad to be znuděný </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The last day díkuvzdání I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> For half a day at the airport for the next years is much pesky, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iphonem (not to mention duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with praise nudění. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that it is good for us (and our children) is sometimes boring. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain to go to interesting directions, which can promote creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> and given that most of us today is constantly connected to any screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the ennui. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So we should support the ennui? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> and no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back to that. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, as well as many people I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that has happened with the arrival of more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But as Peter says toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history in the Canadian university in Calgary, who is the author of the book boredom boredom: a lively history (history) (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, a long history is boring,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The walls in pompejích Latin inscription was found on boredom, coming from the first century AD. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is also the question of how we define ennui. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined and discussed many different ways, said John D. eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in ontariu in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After watching the research literature and transfer ideas the Group of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues defined ennui as experience &quot;I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> boring from apathy distinguishes this, that person is not involved in anything, but I would be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He says that there is no urge to do something for the apathy. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> He says that at the heart of boredom is the attention &quot;of the process, the bad mood and a sense of slowly ubíhajícího time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> boring can remind a lot of depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor eastwood said that while the relationship may have have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, see the problem in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think that nudíme when we only have problems with concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention,&quot; which was published in September in the journal caused by psychological science, Professor eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups learned first hand loud and unrelated television programme in a side room, others have heard it so quietly that it barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard a television programme silent hlásili greater ennui, than the other two groups - had difficulties in concentration, but were not sure why and to these difficulties boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you are trying to focus on the difficult or poutavý task of attention can lead to boredom, said mark J. fenske, professor of Neurosciences at the University of guelph in ontariu and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you do something nudného,&quot; such as a bad components on the line, the distraction of music can help with this, keep you busy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, we now know that kroucení and čmárání, who are often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help nudou fight and keep people physically be more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;research shows that children who is allowed vrtět, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace,&quot; said Professor fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We have all experienced some ennui - my flight delays, hučící speaker, especially a lengthy film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> The scientists developed in the 1980s to help with the measurement of boredom &quot;scale for susceptibility to nudění&quot; (boredom proneness scale). </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale covers issues such as: &quot;many of the things that I have to do is repeated and monotónních, &apos;and&apos; I have so much interest that do not have the time to do them all..&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With these stupnic scientists have found that boys tend to get bored with more often than girls, said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulus. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However, teenagers are generally indifferent. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991 he larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> found that 32 per cent of teenage said that nudili in school and in dělání domestic tasks, while 23 percent said that nudili when not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3% of parents said that the nudili. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that he knows that &quot;growing up is the time for ennui,&quot; which is largely due to the fact that children and young people is not because of a lot of control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: &quot;is boring for you good?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2343"> As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, played a gambling or abused the addictive substances as a way to reduce it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between nudou and creativity, said Professor vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;boring is the way the brain, to tell you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain is always the most appropriate thing you should do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If nudíte and use this energy to play on the guitar and cooking, you will be pleased to do. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you watch TV, you will do the joy, not just for a moment in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child nudí and you give him the iPad, it will not be bored, but nenaučí to take itself or of controlling, said Professor fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;This independent governance is passed on from one situation to the other,&quot; said the professor. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> your child is nenaučí only to take itself, but will be more self-control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to celebrate ennui. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But even against it we should not be too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should rather be feel comfortable when we from the reach of drnčení activities and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor eastwood agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We are accusing it of needs more bored with, but boring is painful, restless, the desire to be associated with something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní,&quot; he said, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to take when the noise turned off.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> in Colorado, there is no manual on the new law on marihuaně </seg>
<seg id="2360"> devatenáctiletý Anthony orozco, a student at the vocational school and higher player from south-eastern colorada, faces charges of criminal offences for what will soon be legal in the state - for possession of several grams of marijuana and cigar, which used for smoking it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr orozco said that one September day he went with a few pals in lamaru, on the plains near the border with kansasem, when he was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After a police officer found the cannabis in the car, it was Mr orozco issued subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment to drug use - petty, for which is fine for every $100 - and he was established for the Court. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We acted as the criminals,&quot; said Mr orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But it is a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after coloradském vote on the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use is the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases on the ground rather than on the right. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has been here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, abolished. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police department to stop blaming the adults at the age of 21 years and older for possession of a small amount of which is legally allowed, after the law comes into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the most conservative districts colorada said that will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, a number of cities from the suburbs denveru towards Western mountains is voting to prevent the opening of the new state licencovaných stores marihuanou in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;this matter is developing so fast that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. oates, the chief of police in the town of Aurora, East of denveru. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The heads of the drbou and regulators in Washington State. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of all of the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, whether for better or for worse, is the first before the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, first of all, and now the holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for licensing to sell alcohol the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But as Mr Smith acknowledged, no place or system cannot do more than suggest what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent under which we could manage,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, the so-called i-502, is to take effect on December 6, which also leaves the vacuum, during which will still not be a state licensing system, but legal possession of yes. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> and there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to balance state directive on &quot;appropriate&quot; access to a licensed marihuaně with its ban on trade with konopím in 330 metres away from schools, parks, children&apos;s playgrounds or children&apos;s centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with konopím than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the center for legal cannabis, recently based research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> 21 November sent police chief of oates e-mail its officers from the town of Aurora, in which they announced that the prosecutor will prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen 21 years old and that the police &quot;with immediate effect&quot; stop blaming people for these crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief of oates said that the police will promote urban laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> in the district of weld in northern Colorado is a district prosecutor Ken buck stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> currently faces charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which was crimes at a time when they occurred,&quot; said Mr buck in its statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response was complicated in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected marihuanovou initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> police in Grand junction, the city district, already adults blame for possession of a small amount. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> district prosecutor, Pete hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to nezamítnout all the cases of possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think that I am losing my continuing my time until the change in law enforcement,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Those who did not take it too lightly, it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> a year spent $1 300 to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The government&apos;s package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 to the child, the maternity leave and allocates financial benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all these measures have little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in South-East Asia, also known konzervatizmem their leaders and strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the classification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered the level of recovery, in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why singapurci do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the national office for population says that this is because of the &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;So people are available to a wider range of options in terms of the goals and priorities, it is not only the wedding and family,&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to delay marriage and bring children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> While there have been efforts in the immigration policy drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people it caused resentment among local residents. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> on some of the Singapore website is seen explicit xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of the independence of the Singapore government. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election appeared to deal with the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the decline in birth rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policy in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to make the nestavělo so small home. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> to start, for example, affect trade in real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development authority to regulate the number of small apartments known as &quot;boxes from Shine,&quot; which can build in some urban areas. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a 46 square meters and had great success in prodejnosti. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is a fear that these apartments can encourage mládenecký lifestyle and deter developers to build large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew soon, the director of the developer of the developers, says that their &quot;box from Shine&quot; to sell far more quickly than more houses. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> &quot;they are popular, and they are sold on days to weeks faster than houses with greater size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> So are much better for our cash flow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, admits that the new standards set clearer rules developers who were previously restrained when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> too become stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is the state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although the new rules could seek to increase the birth rate of the nation, the conversation singapurci workers in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will have a great effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;people are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people to be postponed,&quot; says a young officer. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> &quot;others whether they have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> But it is important for me to rely on their own time and money,&quot; says another, about a 20-year-old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> men and women mention career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>

<seg id="2680"> key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> marielos porrasová, an English teacher and absolventka field of education and teaching, it is that children and adolescents in social networks to focus properly, they must understand that the main aim of these networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> states that: &quot;the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but when there is social networks, has changed the rules of the game.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2683"> marrielos porrasová notes that academic worker Marc prensky, a graduate pedagogiky at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, these concepts to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;digital natives are children and young people who were born in a time of this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> We have the digital immigrants, who must learn them, while themselves only learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He explains that this is a complex issue,&quot; because we are asking them to rozeznávali what is appropriate to publish and what to say, no, on the contrary, in an age when still not zralí.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2689"> &quot;tell them not to do so, does not work,&quot; adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> further marrielos porrasová lists some of the options: are things that you stranger nevyprávěl, so why this re doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> or: like those, if someone published your email dive as you those published kamarádovu? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the rest of you publish? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When označuješ people on fotkách of the celebrations, you asked for permission from these people? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> and one more: they need to constantly all know what is re doing? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is, to realise that they have to behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>

<seg id="2748"> President Correa has confirmed that this decision nelituje because it betrayed its principles and respect its &quot;deep democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Add to that at the time &quot;there were credible allegations that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, the Swedish justice, which asked him to Swedish territory underwent interrogation because of alleged sexual deliktu,&quot; own the Swedish legislation allows for interrogation videokonferenčním hovorem, which could take place from ekvádorského Embassy in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk that the assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and mental health. </seg>

<seg id="2755"> President Correa noted that the asylum granted Assange since June on ekvádorském Embassy in London on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and point out that London held talks to resolve the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> &quot;We on human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case, but not always talks taking place. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because assangeův lawyer baltazar garzón is a series of management in various European ones,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> He said that &quot;if the United Kingdom will tomorrow propustku, everything will end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> and if Sweden Mr assangeho listen to on ekvádorském Embassy in London or via Skype, as this allows the legislation without a problem and, as has been done in other cases will be made after this problem tomorrow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa used the situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and make it clear that it does not tolerate &quot;podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie that undermine freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The greatest enemies of free press are not we podlí and evil politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit nátlaků and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> From this point of view, expressed delight at the even takovíto journalists,&quot; or bankers or hegemonic country and even speak of the bourgeoisie &quot;Ecuador and předeslal, that if it is re-elected,&quot; will continue in the changes brought the right way and in the right direction. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto paraguayi on membership in the Union, Unasur at least until the next election and argued that the whole &quot;must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus riddle wrapped in the legality,&quot; because in fact &quot;undermine the legitimacy of paraguayské democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Ecuador&apos;s president said that, in addition, considers &quot;completely appropriate&quot; fusion of the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, in time for the ruling by the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment, the judgment is not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> &quot;It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> conflicts are unavoidable, but it must be overcome will go along. </seg>

<seg id="2769"> also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute over maritime borders, which is in the same Court Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that &quot;is right for Latin America to seek international resort in both countries to commit to the judgment, however, will be tough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In connection with the possibility that it will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to ucházel in order for a third mandate, noted that sees this option &quot;with great optimism and joy, even when it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has said that, if the elections in February 2013 loses out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;I personally never nezajímala power, but as unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can repair the only political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> My political movement believed that it is me who guarantees that likely victory, so we need to take the responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> &quot;If I won, it would be my last presidential term and would then left from the policy. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I have the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> I have already decided,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if to me, lightning,&quot; tells in the memories of the moment of truth that a doctor tried to &quot;moderate&quot; a bit, but apparently without success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> a boy before family tajil. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> decided to take their disease itself on their shoulders and began to inform and with such commitment, that already celebrated 43. birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is undoubtedly one of nejdávnějších units of HIV patients in the civil hospital in guadalajaře (hcg), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio live with the human virus used (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> then with him or the clinic Director of Mexico&apos;s social security Institute (imss) nerozloučil,&quot; because he had the cutting blow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then the AIDS have been synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, it is a lot of people who know about their disease and come only when the virus caused the death of the organism and vysílil immune system, and then become victims of random infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years since there have been documented cases of the disease AIDS, or at least since the first in the world,&quot; is a great success that the patient&apos;s life expectancy, which will begin in a timely and appropriate manner with treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people,&quot; said Jaime Andrade villanueva HIV troops in the civil hospital in guadalajaře that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> infektolog and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is death, but the judgment that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability the patients&apos; immune system, which is diagnosed with the disease, with better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 cells cd4 can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells cd4 up to 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that the one who is HIV diagnostikováno in 25 years, according to these findings can &quot;in compliance with treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems,&quot; the doctor explained in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> to highlight the progress of this it is worth recalling that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6 railway twice in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (a common agenda for the HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients. </seg>

<seg id="2798"> - why people continue to die of the disease? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - &quot;It seems to me that the problem is not in the opportunities for access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That is how I see it like this is happening in the US in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have not run out of medical supplies, the problem is that patients come in very advanced, because they do not know the condition of, or in late stage disease.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2802"> adds compelling figure: &quot;nine out of ten patients comes as the show some přidružená infection. All that more needs to be done to influence the overall mortality rate is used to diagnose the disease, and therefore need to be on a large scale to offer tests to identify the disease all the people who ask for them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the National Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do tests to private laboratories just because he did his friend, and despite its low age there have also suffered from the outbreak of AIDS and kaposiho sarkomem, cancer, which is one of the complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> &quot;everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>

<seg id="2810"> I work, I have a lot of activities, I, I am an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for themselves and on the other person,&quot; Fabrizio lists, which adopted a call to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco to today in the World AIDS Day encouraged those who fear their testimony. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> &quot;the tests will be done if the risk of whether knows as soon as possible, whether they are HIV positive, it is better if it were diagnostikováni, whether they realise that they can live as anyone else when they are responsible.&quot; </seg>
