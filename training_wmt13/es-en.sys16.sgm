<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the Brennan Center considers this a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die as a result of the fall of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to what is happening in Canada, American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the ballot and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The State of Indiana was the first to claim it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American people do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American people, that is to say, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification issued by a government agency in your state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 without an identity document with these features. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have an identity document with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there are still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students in many states, more voters to vote for Democratic candidates, they cannot use the photo ID issued by your institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, those same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs that tend to vote for the Republican party to use the documents issued by those clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abol√≠an voter registration on the day of the ballot in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the record of about 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters to fall in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the period of advance voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter do not represent more than 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of Hispanics did exactly the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These do not represent more than 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, who account for 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have been fervently opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The public prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Was, in part, to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity document with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, because it is clear that they intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: Does Getting the test or not let? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the PSA test has, on occasion, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it was decided to hold unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a more than sufficient reason to doubt the men, already reluctant in itself, whether or not they should be screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Does Getting the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked for advice from two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies in the United States found a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make recommendations firm. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the European study showed a difference in mortality among patients who had carried out the detection and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, with a follow-up to the age of 12, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if there has been a screening test. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend, therefore, the test at the age of 50, or 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African American men have a higher risk index. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are nonchalant. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the riskiness of his cancer, he must offer all possible options and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not jeopardize the long-term life, in which case you should opt instead for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, because the cancer is not aggressive and poses a risk to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, they suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> &quot;We find increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend that you do the test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (for the moment only in English, but translations will be offered soon) at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / have-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one to smoke, that rate would rise by at least 50%,&quot; stresses Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead, we evaluate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others remain totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Tobacco is associated with 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Greatly harm people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; they added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency recommends, too, limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, they climb the risks of suffering a colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Meat products should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat for smoking, salting or drying can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;Can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between cancer and vitamin complexes. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, for the moment their research is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Structure the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what we observed was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been able to determine with clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Do the screening test does not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs bos√≥n in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bos√≥n likely generated a great shock last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this bos√≥n is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, the particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model: Our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists is not entirely clear that it is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that looks a lot like the Higgs bos√≥n predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physics held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong are few. We will see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There are, in this great world, an inescapable and pervasive law, which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way to violate this rule and don&apos;t try too much, because it will end up getting hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it is also an act of these characteristics: The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;state&quot; that consists basically of some of its features. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists classify particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, which wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: Those taverns, of which we will not discuss here, and the &quot;force particles,&quot; for which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs bos√≥n would be somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it should be pointed out here, are not the exotic creatures that we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this story, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bos√≥n: The photon or &quot;light particle&quot; which acts as a &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, &quot;mess up&quot; the electromagnetic field at that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;disorder&quot; is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons &quot;force carriers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs bos√≥n, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be &quot;messy&quot; so that this bos√≥n appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field to activate it, you need to arrive at extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator at the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all particles and all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not by itself never stuck to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> But what &quot;can provide&quot; all these investigations?, asks the Lady Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, in addition, that physicists escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of the MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For their part, many are strongly desire, because the slightest difference could open the door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that tape some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation concerning the seriousness (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of matter in the Universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of such research in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories not suspected at all the revolution that its work force. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreve√≠an scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where he invented the laser in 1960, which produced the first continuous laser (pulsed) were the first in 1962, initially the laser was considered a &quot;laboratory apparatus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications can also come from all the surrounding instrumentation for research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Despite the fact that it was not at all its original intent, this probe is now &quot;eye&quot; for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission on Dignity in Dying, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be joined again soon as it prepares a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, within this essential domain, there is still much to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to see it closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Mont√©r√©gie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breathing space of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I had been given five years of life, but now I have just seven,&quot; recounts, made a pass, lying on his bed in the middle of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of BELOEIL, who arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this,&quot; he continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has wreaked havoc: A huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, resigned acceptance that help you eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, to smile, to talk to the strangers who will devote attention, we bring medicines and offer a bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found to remedy this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pee standing,&quot; recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back to his childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the ability of the person to accept such a regression,&quot; notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the view of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients who enter the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In this state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer &quot;curative care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of Mrs A, 89 years, is dying &quot;conscious and drowned out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made him to discover their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have some good kids,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer have more desire in this life,&quot; he says, before accepting that he put a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And, in the next few days, a last visit to his son, who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They are palliative care that we give them when you cannot do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to help his death be more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, we have a bed of palliative care for every 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little, because we know that all we will end up dying someday. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> He was dying to offer of mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> For diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son was finished beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to a 94-year-old man who savor their last family reunion in the courtyard, well-placed between their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old boy tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For the past six months, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years sick of cancer,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the center Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his house and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the center Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home in the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this large relative shortage in health care in Quebec which makes many doctors who specialize in palliative care fear the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Christiane Martel, the health system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Recently,&quot; he explained, &quot;I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Spain without suffering great pain has done what is necessary to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive appropriate care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of H√©l√®ne Richard were already at a low ebb when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;When I told my onc√≥loga who wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I would like to stop fighting,&quot; recounts. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die for their carers who have not responded to their demands once they have been relieved their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the disease is not relieved will have the opportunity to have that palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want euthanasia,&quot; but &quot;I want to alleviate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism research institutes of health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers for political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable &quot;system,&quot; which are part of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that was too expensive to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted for big media,&quot; satirises Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into corruption linked to road contracts in Quebec, the Liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not consented to delay. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report &quot;Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts,&quot; containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission has already done &quot;Charbonneau fall to two mayors,&quot; he adds, while expected to reach &quot;demonstrate the existing ploys behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The ongoing anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit operates in addition to the officers of the &quot;Marteau,&quot; which, since 2009, have made the &quot;sewer&quot; of the cartel of Montreal moderate to inflate contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> These past few weeks, the unit has proceeded to record in series of allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town on the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec City. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected that has been repeated pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> It has been charged to engineers of the road network in Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and furthermore, Lino. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused shock to the committee to explain the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid for three years, 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor G√©rald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Furthermore, M. distributed money to right and centre during the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He admitted, too, have organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Inflation in the cost of the contracts sewage </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly before the committee: In ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay had deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies of Montreal did sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the district of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, since 2010 objected to the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> The 70% of the money for election campaigns was dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> Finally, the investigation will take place, it ensures that pulls a thread &quot;in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> And he adds that the process is painful, but good. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but one would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant to ensure that dubious practices will not be repeated. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> He regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is worried especially about the role of the &apos;&quot;elected politicians aware of the ploy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, observes: &quot;I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government proposes to limit Tsao $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;while not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It recommends a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: &quot;We can&apos;t get any lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Big players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I advance from day to day by his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also has brought me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements and push me on a daily basis to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a party, that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very fast in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my start in the centre of preformaci√≥n of INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds. </seg>
<seg id="262"> It is going to get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruited this summer are used to play games of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That makes a player like me would like to fight and give everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> But Ancelotti is the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no one equal in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence they have in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyon has taken the post of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, you can do anything. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of quarterfinals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Does the PSG can become a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to their means to make this project happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to win the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we are going to invest all our efforts to lead the title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we not far away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were a disappointment, because we had the conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We ended up with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, had a pretty good season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it will be a good thing. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe that we have the weapons to llev√°rnoslo. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media are more than PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We have accepted. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still find themselves with things that criticise is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what else the people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to put in place a project of game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Talk to Manchester City, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the quarterfinals, and they have also invested a great deal! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums invested, os imaginar√≠amos with 15 point advantage on the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, had been &quot;driven&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has come to show that it is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And it has shown in all the teams for which he has passed is a great player, a star in the world. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men who are around them. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How you&apos;ve lived through the EURO 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was very excited to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I left strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, play good matches achievement in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I expected from my baptism with the &quot;blue.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What you have vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the helm of the &quot;blue&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are well-placed in the group of qualification for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved its goal of mechanics for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps leads to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork? </seg>
<seg id="346"> That game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each one fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the shock in Spain, had not experienced a game like this in my entire career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, identified transactions and processing loads between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc, and a secure protocol to change the way of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files on an equal footing. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> There is nothing impressive compared to the global changes in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> In it, he described the bitcoin as &quot;the most successful&quot; virtual currency, &quot;which competes with the dollar or the euro,&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other systems with different types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits,&quot; used to move in a video game and that you can win by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeem). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But a central authority in all exchange controls and about the changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of dual-key encryption. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins entered in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write the new transaction in that book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase of cubed file, that is, transformation of a large file in a shorter numerical footprint and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot;chop up&quot; the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once you find that number, the other nodes easily verify that is a good thing. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any changes would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other would be left an orphan, as both have different tracks. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cienmillon√©simo, leaving a wide margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also in every increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The ruling does not affect the same protocol used,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Actors of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the platform Wordpress, accepted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analysed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, it launched the &quot;giant cuts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;They changed $30,000,&quot; rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of a book about teaching that currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but Bitcoin used to validate transactions, that are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to set up in the shops, which do not have to install new software or terminals. </seg>
<seg id="395"> You just have to provide an address that a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take a while for Bitcoin will prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change,&quot; predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this successful currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We come out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What happens next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should leave by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and that Afghans choose their own future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished mainly to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chief refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as in the days of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes join jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops in the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was made to order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul after the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since his irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of his peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators, gaining government land for resale as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; most of them do not have fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as it will be those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and their ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With around 65% of its population under the age of 25 years, Kabul has right now with 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> We need to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties and the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile telephones, television and chapbooks Turks with a modern world has great admirers across the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle to reconstitute already concerned provincial militias, will flee from the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States had wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly during the elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, the country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has restored its services, it has not been fixed nor any reservoir have been repaired irrigation systems. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported and does not produce anything except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining riches. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that only added to the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to extract the copper or iron ore from the ground and with no means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) and the immense site excaven b√∫dico remain there as the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will also require that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The French troops departed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Schools for girls, schools for children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the fields of military, legal, health and agriculture and supporting the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, with the aim of trying to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and to perform the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of &quot;civilian and military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, and he did bring brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, greedy to obtain local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop surfaces. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often located over 2,000 meters high. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy received dozens of complaints written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> For the release of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, would be required to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and reaching them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution with forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives full powers, he decided to play everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Only a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to this Assembly to finish their work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has done more to increase the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the president is persisting in his delirium &quot;autocratic&quot; and &quot;betraying continues his word&quot; and &quot;trampling the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the part of his supporters, ensures that this is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days should organize a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which obliges the Brothers to relinquish his project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as stated in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;I stand by my vote or text or full powers,&quot; powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, the text voted yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the liberals did not go to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their points of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, substitute members, in a hurry. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> As expected, the articles have been voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent clock was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, they hoped to be able to replace &quot;principles&quot; for &quot;the rules,&quot; which would have allowed a stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of his goodwill and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Liberals accused him of hypocrisy and feel that it is not more than an advertising trick. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They relate, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University, a consultative role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is troubling because &quot;people called to pronounce is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Here we see the premises of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next chancellor of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For now, there is no specific religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital status. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system, &quot;explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding the article 220, because the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> &quot;We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on top of all of this. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received a lot of criticism that relate to the extended powers that gives the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were under the former regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another sticking point: The powers granted to the military. </seg>
<seg id="492"> According to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national council of defence. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Nor will be banned prosecutions of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which they consider liberticidal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, the insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word did not appear in the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="584"> Most of those who came to tour the country and the rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, UK and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% at the same rate in the year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime powered on 9 February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="586"> &quot;The great and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While deputies and human rights advocates argue about the consequences that would bring the law on the compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country scamming trading with certificates &quot;false&quot; </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Its only goal is to earn money to help their families who have been left at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December a law comes into force, according to which each immigrant labour should make an examination to test their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the field of service delivery, community service agencies, household services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be made mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and to renew the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Exception are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> They will not be subject to this law, people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Utility, doom and defence of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of centres examiners will work sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of Saint Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants will be able to present the evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 centres of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But the defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, they often make this question to the press: What will bring this into reality? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will bring the requirement of knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and immigrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, are the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people who suffer from &quot;slave labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people talk today about defending the rights of immigrants in the workplace, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defense of their rights must begin before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems are immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, immigrant&apos;s future will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of help, a lot of my &quot;paid&quot; a shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In his homeland promised one thing, but when you arrive are deceived, are deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised,&quot; confirms the head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labour migration from Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Don&apos;t be angry, jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much his fault, but his own misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone clothe them, calzarlos and buy what is necessary for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> When they reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if you don&apos;t know the language, they recognize them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;One feels humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, with regard to the law on language, the rights advocates point to an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If you do not have that status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or prohibited the move to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be done quickly and by only thousand five hundred rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;We are asking for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,&quot; commented to journalists on a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Come on, don&apos;t be stingy, buy a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only the documents for registration of immigrants may be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> A number of &quot;false&quot; certificates of knowledge of the language has already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The forged documents had been printed in standard color printers. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners, not as a gift: Every immigrant, who wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the &quot;diplomas&quot; is not to buy, converge government officials and human rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities can promise to immigrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with guns registered is quite small </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of the Interior is proposing to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the government&apos;s reaction to the recent incidents: Tighten shot during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre started by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogr√°dov, squeezing seven people lost their lives. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to ban the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raise the minimum age for handgun license, 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised to reform the law on weapons possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot;hardline policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of handles, demand that it abandon such measures of strict &quot;meaningless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service from Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy L√©snikov. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to total 1168 crimes recorded for the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of civilian use of weapons will not be a drawback for the offender is targeted to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, in his words, in Moscow can be found any weapon at low prices. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From factories to official </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapons is supplied through various channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who for 10 years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first, &quot;vestige of the military or army,&quot; that is to say, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same Caucasians,&quot; says Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The following types of &quot;black&quot; weapon, stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that here include weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the law enforcement bodies. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal weapons are on sale from the military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military arsenals often had explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There are versions demonstrated that some of the fires were caused deliberately to cover the shortage,&quot; says a exmilitar. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put their bit. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now private factories have proliferated weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including in Moscow,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> A further source of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and has formed a mob that has organized the flow of arms,&quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have calculated what is the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on this subject was developed in 2011 by the Center for planning and analysis of problems of governance. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and RosStat, criminological literature and public access data portals whose theme revolves around the weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons on the black market has arrived there &quot;because of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; it says in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the &quot;illegal&quot; archaeology. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by the illegal diggers not buying anyone for a long time because they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he says, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Through some major, the provider buys a unit, for example a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The removed from the register and pass over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;It takes the weapon to the city and sold to 900 euros per unit with two chargers,&quot; tells us </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when there is to comply with the plan of discovery of crime, carried out test purchases of illegal arms dealers,&quot; adds the dependent. </seg>

<seg id="683"> &quot;I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform&quot; Begovaya, &quot;where he would be a man who I would lead to a&quot; esquinita &quot;where we could negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, I learned only there. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="686"> &quot;I need to get a gun to a friend who has contacts,&quot; says the shop assistant: &quot;I have a friend like that, but not much trust in him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the markets, but there also has to be, say &quot;on the part of Mr Ivanovih, who asked him to say that he had fallen a tooth his daughter.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="691"> The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Schemes, according to his words, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Gave him a photo album where there was no &quot;everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like in a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, does not offer a pig in a poke: Everything can be proven. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, as a potential customer, not just buy; we are going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I can assure you that the gun shoots well, we began to negotiate,&quot; describes the procedure the expert. </seg>

<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, he sent a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden,&quot; recounts the press secretary of the NGO &quot;The right to arms,&quot; Dmitri Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets states that if you place an order online, one is left without a weapon and put them in jail. </seg>

<seg id="722"> Employees are on strike of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as a cashier at McDonald&apos;s &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has initiated a wave of protests against low wages paid in supermarkets of the Walmart corporation in the popular restaurants and fast food chains, such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or if you are destined to lose strength and amansarse in its early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protest actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages earned by employees of Walmart and the fast-food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> How Forty-six cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The action began last week, the day after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday.&quot; That day, in the United States coomenzaba orgy of cuts that captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed to protest alongside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are aimed at people with modest incomes and moderates. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many workers underpaid Walmart buy only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and the range of products made from Walmart one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of a forklift or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> This &quot;Black Friday&quot; participants of the rally demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation spent $30 to $100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on wages now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart puts wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they will spend a ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; lasted in its stores from 8 o&apos;clock in the afternoon of Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their tills made the &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Web site Huffington Post, who left his job &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than &quot;a public relations stunt,&quot; organized by the union workers. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free Box!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not exactly Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and so for now there are none), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> But McDonald&apos;s says it sells billions of pieces, and then not even give you the sick leave and don&apos;t pay for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one earns less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with this money, it is incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed by the McDonald&apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, while still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly stumbling in some interviews with McDonald&apos;s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&apos;t know what to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 Thursday morning at the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that they were double the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast food industry create workers&apos; unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the administration to prevent them from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy to cover the food sector unions ra. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the excessive staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant, </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald&apos;s located near Times Square, attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it is selling billions of portions, and then even gives you a hospital or pay you for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, the candidate for mayor of the city, Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must support workers in the fast food industry to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that it deserves every New York.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described by the New York Times newspaper, this was the largest demonstration of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But there were only a few hundred people, even if not all of them were employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google showed a model in motion and then, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the relevant patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, in a conversation with the head of the group of 3D interactive technology on the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that for scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a bygone era. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are attracted by the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but also trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now, humanity as a mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes plays with his finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, because all they are interested in the gesture control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What more of what the future holds? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, we work in a truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including the design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We must rid the world of computing to ours, the physical, making it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient way. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Firstly, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A very popular detail, but do not believe that I exaggerate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - Of course we cannot be seen as a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, since we are not always want others to learn about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In addition, the gestures were not caught by the camera of the device, but for a bracelet that was the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now, it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture and voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How is that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how I would ask you to spend this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will speak and show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, this is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Or, you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at this moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have of the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do you lack resolution, depth or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the issue is not in the cards, but the quality of the matrix and in depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; it gives more work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also important to the speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much this affects the man-machine interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that doesn&apos;t require contact for more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The &quot;Kinect&quot; now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is in fact a simple pitch visible sensor. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, the number of cameras could solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the while holding high a smartphone in your hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think that the best option would be an augmented reality &quot;transmutable&quot; when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend the glasses to the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private things only you can see them), but also its weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses will not work on virtual objects along with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - let&apos;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark in the movie &quot;Iron Man,&quot; but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: There is no tactile response! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What your group prepares answers to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as a support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Sign-Up for the touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at providing tangibilidad these &quot;pictures in the air,&quot; for example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams aimed at a specific point where the finger feels similar to that one feels if somebody was sopl√°ndole at their fingertips, but this feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Do you think that he feels that it seems that I should feel at the moment that sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - That is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that is going to create an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For now, the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;avant-garde of St Petersburg,&quot; dedicated to people who are in front, at the cutting edge of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list are the best and the brightest stars of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: Often find recognition in Europe without Russia even know. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The entire city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and inaugurations. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The paintings of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of those young purely sociofil√≥sofos St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of Saint Petersburg in the late 1980s to the early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man, whose appearance in the streets of the city&apos;s inhabitants awake in smiles and lifts all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he took in his hands a organillo and became the recording of Saint Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, for his bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - Choose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggression and agitation of properties nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When comprendiste destinations be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work is displayed. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free, like me, were still incomprendidos. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent to those faced in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10,&quot; and it is over the new wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I Sunni minorities in the theater by the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this stuck in your art Clinic... - For me it was important to be in the cultural centre of Saint Petersburg, where they were supposed to gather the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reform, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Saint Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I recall the way that Schnur brought the project to &quot;The Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and his friends sang songs light under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began playing live, became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; the &quot;Griboedov&apos;s Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was &quot;The people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was elected I, thus ended my culmination. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In these new times is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our times, it is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - There is something recognizable in your work. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they are clearly present and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to make a scheduled exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used to be sociable, but now it is painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns are all embadurna and the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now you are on the clothes, driven abroad, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps that person should not be or give a hand, but spit on him in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed when you change clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - A little you saw in the role of urban recording. - A cultured city must have a hero as well. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than I to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now the commercial art must be careful, sweet, having tact. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people are grouped together in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplones. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into microcomunidades, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to wish them all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we have to think about who you want to taste. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to STAS Mikhailov arrive by thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - going to see the left, there is the sex-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event is 300 people, 10 thousand will never; as a result, less management, less money, everything is fading. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have to my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young was such a collector had the paintings hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which people usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money just to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is it that is missing in St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Buenos experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: Official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can engage in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the kings were the correct all was in another way, kings may not understood very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in Saint Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level to evaluate them properly and open way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> It is now thriving the subjective personal taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for you Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital in Moscow, there is a lot more culture, there are ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones that art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make art is out of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be carried out with a grant of Saint Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or an asteroid collision with a killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with humans aboard leave in search of a planet parts. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to preserve mankind becomes the main question: How to continue the species in weightlessness or on the same planet parts? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that there is little choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says the head of the State Astronomical Institute researcher, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago that were carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit but not in any of the terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the dros√≥filas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, were sent into space quail eggs to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> As a result we get a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By failing to find support, chicks were randomly Acer. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in newborns was a total atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks not reacted to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the misfortune was that after four days simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And we got twice born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time a &quot;biological&quot; miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the &quot;Bion&quot; biosat√©lite only will travel species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space with fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it is not found nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;This was precisely the biosat√©lites, but this was a unique experiment, and such studies should be carried out,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it has not yet managed to deal with the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, to lose their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, it can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel into space for 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And what is most precious to humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our flying gull, and no one on Earth could say: If you are after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> You may or may not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, no one has responded to this question,&quot; says the veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nicolayev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit, and even worked in the open space, had a child. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> There are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights have all turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,&quot; summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Center&apos;s hidrolaboratorio preparation of cosmonauts is an essential stage in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills to work in space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If an adult in the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is their native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming newborns. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravitation, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the weightlessness abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitan is very fast, the ability of expulsion of the fetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we drop it, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it pulls. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?,&quot; Valeri Polyakov is this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton and the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn in orbit she is impossible with a special suit for training, as well as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Simply he is without what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment that we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to back to Earth to a disabled person, a person completely from afar,&quot; provides for the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships come to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Chief NK√ö: The inspection of the system &quot;≈°varc&quot; has not given the guilty politician </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limp. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> So says Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NK√ö) in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect,&quot; but its application must be correct. &quot;This is, in my opinion, what we lack,&quot; thus describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The controls sets of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of an incorrect practice, says Petr Neƒças&apos;s attitude towards the system be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;≈°varc&quot; system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The prime minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors, so it is forbidden or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be regulated in some way and if something forbidden, in this case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations,&quot; finds Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the German and Czech team, within the framework of which compared the legislation concerning the public contracts in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly is? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we began to make some two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> To put it simplified: European legislation regulates how they should organize the public contracts, this is followed by the current legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have united all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences, the legislation of our country is &quot;stricter and more complete,&quot; however, the actual practice in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can contribute to this project? What do you think are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is a common control of this kind could contribute to that we stop investing efforts in the realization of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, though this does not have a very positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of saving means to achieve an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not for the sake of reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much &quot;red tape&quot; that those who want to find flaws in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the pr√°cticaa of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of checks in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is it an office similar to our NK√ö or is organized differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> How to the offices, such as the NK√ö, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a way that is somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are also to some extent anal√≥gas, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. Here differs slightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call here state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to local laws, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Generally, I would not want to establish a comparison without concrete data, however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but you cannot specify exactly what is best. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to do this kind of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must cope with a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If it were not so, there would be no benefit to collaborate with our office, do you not think? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office the amendment of the law on public contracts? Somehow manifested its incidence? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been manifested in the actions of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Given that we make ex post controls, it is necessary to have a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, there is in the process of preparing for the future: We have launched a new tool to detect &quot;non-economic risks,&quot; by which we spend almost 14,000 public contracts, which have been analysed, the changes will be fully reflected here, as they are modified the limits, are the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the regulation &quot;harden&quot; and that it is impossible to comply with it. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> As with the previous regulations, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law is not respected in the field of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create a greater bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how it comes out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We&apos;ll see where this road leads us. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with the so-called ≈°varc system controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper, what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Does the system ≈°varc &quot;is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be regulated in some way, and if something is prohibited, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office, which has an obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;We change the law and allow it,&quot; but you cannot say that we will do as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public contracts, the regulations are very strict in terms of the way in which we must act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct, that is, in my opinion, what we are missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are ice, although mostly impassable </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places in the Czech Republic the roads with ice and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Although most of the tracks impassable, some caution must be increased. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary region </seg>
<seg id="1058"> This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but showed plates of ice and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperature drops and between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day will rise slightly thermometers. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas, the snow cover is thin. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> In contrast, in the crests of the Montes halide snow reaches almost 30 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> In some places the visibility was still poor because of fog, according to the information from the operations control center of the roads in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The fast-track R6 and first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> However, it is recommended to exercise caution, especially in some bridges whose surface can be icy and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> In addition, they are also guaranteed all avenues of second and third category, including mountain roads. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and snow packed. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> It is necessary to increase the attention on the road, especially in the higher areas. </seg>

<seg id="1080"> After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some routes could also be covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but the visibility will improve gradually. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> This is what emerges from the reports of the operations control center of roads in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The highway D5 is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to exercise caution, particularly on the road between 80 km and 131. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The surface of the majority of first-class roads is dry and ice-free. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> In the area of Plze≈à and Tachov bordering Germany may have sections with ice sheets. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The second and third category are damp, so that, in this case, also warns of sections with ice. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> It is said that in less than a month is going to be the end of the world, what do you think about this? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one among many other alarmist news that we like agarrarnos. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The music group The Tap Tap we like rather make jokes about this, and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, in December a truly original project organiz√°is: Three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you explain this to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a state-run charity event that we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that is the end of the Mayan calendar for statement on 21 December at 11: 10 am. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Will end up at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, after all we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, about the state of the world we will leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, T-shirts, bags and original key rings at the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the anthem at the end of the world, entitled &quot;End of the world, cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the benefits? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course we do, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and there is no end of the world... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The performers sing all at the same time in all three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The hymns they want to each other simultaneously, thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tom√°≈° Han√°k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our efforts to participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and amused them to work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the money raised in the concerts at the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we perform in its sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership Tap in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the school of Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav regularly receive visits from teachers with fun and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students do not have sufficient financial resources to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the works in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, there will be a separate building which we will move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert act several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you have scheduled another &quot;spectacular&quot; similar action in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will act for the first time in the festival Pra≈æsk√© bird, so here surely we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to be complemented by actions in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your overseas plans are not exactly minimalist, until now have done for example in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five members in an electric wheelchair, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and in addition we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until now we have managed well. ƒåSA and British Airways were well prepared, which never ceases to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, went very smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What you have found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia, we have seen that in the east, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common for a single person moves through the center of the city in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in the lift, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, it has created a civil association that strives to focus attention on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what ways we should follow the example of more advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many ways in which we are behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability moves on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where you go. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap just go a little bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when it comes to the emergence of eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, there are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered as an educator in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, where he had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And over time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, we were a little hands (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not arrive until the last few years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, it is as if it did not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can afford more quality teachers, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Do you had intended to go as far with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, that something can be done differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment world is full of things that look like each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its own way, everything new is viewed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings that suffer and that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that has the necessary means. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something goes well for them to people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> How Assisted the fact that you are a demanding boss, as he describes a lot of people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think that it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the group The Tap Tap has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come in and go out, cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and desire will always find the doors open </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday at 9pm 20.12.2012 </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno Fl√©da and Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians will participate in the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance the school multifunctional equipment without barriers in Prague STUDEO Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, costing 25 million korunas. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of advance sales at Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency held last week in Poland was accepted as the 12th member of ESA is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years he participated in the commission of the agency projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights into space before World War II, though not always understood his work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld in the astronomical observatory in Warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, ≈†ternfeld recalled that Dr Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In the year 1934 ≈†ternfeld won the prize in France Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later turned into a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and was not familiar with details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to boot the dresina or for braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Kom√≥rka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> On the basis of the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of German troops, was interrupted the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski and the following year was published the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza,&quot; the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile technology for military use and coordinate all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy referred for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He held this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM sounding rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg of weight. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, he completed the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began flight tests of the RM-2 rockets in two stages in the desert of B≈Çƒôd√≥w. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of developing rocket was supposed to be the object of scientific study. The rocket RM-34 would have a height of 14,5 km and its mission would be to control the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, the work was suspended in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from each other by the available space for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket in the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum height in the three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Version was later built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland in the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation into the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladim√≠r Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social traabajos. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal economic systems in the EU, just as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> As a result, this means that the various forms of economic and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the large differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, is trying to shorten distances and this leads to a &quot;bajadda&quot; of the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over the bulk of the market and thus increase their profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buy cheaper there or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows necessarily social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Less than honest practices of private capital creates situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of reducing artificially the social level of the population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Put another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly evident in the changes to the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to force the people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially when it comes to wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial liability in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labor rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years, in Germany, there are points of delivery of food for poor people who cannot stay with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people who receive this type of aid arrives at a million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: People employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It was such a public scandal related to the situation of the German federal parliament&apos;s auxiliary employees. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The saving measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU are, without a doubt, the same situation: People, under pressure from an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or malvivir with a very bad salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day the country private investor capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary preguntrarse where it comes from? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny portion of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also affects all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to manage the economy leads to its failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital has no effect on your selfishness in the political progress and, consequently, throughout the state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in the mutual favours, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but it is not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is this: The state ministries, in the absence of financial resources, are drafting bills to private law firms, which are often associated with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> In this way, not all power emanates from the people, as was announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation that&apos;s how Appi√°nos describes in his book The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: &quot;The state has long disintegrating and administrations are occupied by force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favours obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and the people went to the polls to vote apalabrado beforehand... &quot;&quot; had not people with character showed it to aspire to a post in the administration, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls... &quot;&quot; He commenced to talk seriously that the only remedy for a situation so serious was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man... &quot;Although Appi√°nos thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and democracy transformed forever in autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today&apos;s society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not capable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefit of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the rise of communist and fascist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a kind of liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in the ancient history and the most recent one. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is to concrete socio-political reforms, which will strengthen both the involvement of the state capital and the influence of citizens in government and to weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: The laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (There is no violence, and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads &quot;Let&apos;s do not forget how fragile we are&quot; (let us not forget how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want wars, there would be no&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the recent waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and cast in the role of the Palestinian terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Arabs and Palestinians accused Israel of state terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated regularly and who is the victim; after all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginnings of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that creep for 95 years (calculated on the basis of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in the conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the issue, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps autonomously or if behind his throne had someone who directed their actions toward a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to accept that we live in an era that the world&apos;s wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, has not been able to get in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these is an astronomically rich families that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but do not exclude): The Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> It is not much to write about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 90s of the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with criminal acts of great severity, power and wealth, or both, they were covering the shoulders, which to them always meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have significant holdings in almost all the world&apos;s central banks, and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq was 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi were only four, but in the meantime, Russia has imposed the central bank to the Russian government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of the year 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> His quest for global power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, awarded the degree 33. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war espoused to eliminate the big states royalists throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not will consume fewer resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method with which operates the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are, however, wrong, and always entail a worsening of the situation; if not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created to prevent a repeat of a crisis like that of 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the onset of the First World War, destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified from an economic and military point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars in order to put an end to the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, allowed bankers and politicians to create, so covert, a conflict arises in the wake of the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, was enough to serve them with the Germans the solution of the F√ºhrer, who was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilty, and build a Czechoslovakia after composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was supposed to represent and represented so well the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and led to the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild drove the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope that had him tied international bankers initially or if all he did was part of a plan; however, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was established the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers managed to start, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the Arab population and, generally, Muslims in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how to divide so starkly supporters and detractors of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as it happens in our country, international bankers just presented their candidates in elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, given that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict, and if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the entire global oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what light are now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis, and people will agree with a new world order.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population served by a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy. </seg>

<seg id="1335"> Argo film: If you put crude oil, call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a group of Islamist students held a demonstration of the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed R√©za P√°hlevi, which after the revolution he fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation for the American administration did not offer any positive perspective: Throwing overboard the Shah could not afford it, because, if it did, undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not available to them. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film &quot;Argo&quot; of the director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which harvested a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before occupying the embassy, escaped six employees of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a complicated journey, ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by a covert history an extravagant point: Came with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that looked at the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan that he drew the expert &quot;exfiltraci√≥n&quot; Toni Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the lie seem truthful, he wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the fictitious production company even had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck&apos;s film is a unique combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the Ocean&apos;s Eleven series). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film combines the moods, on the one hand, are well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were set forth in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> In addition, the scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Each men who analyzed the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and their ways has ceased to be the targets of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film, after &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town and City of thieves&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> In addition, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that put the directors of old films over Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck is shown in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;wheel&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events true. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its concise ability that, at the same time, transmitted the thrill of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators achieved a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the impostor in the bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the way of the film&apos;s most intriguing scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: Not everything here is so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit after his track become crazy). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the arousing that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Neuwirth and John Goodman has a very funny role as collaborators of Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means alone in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, Affleck&apos;s film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that you can continue with a moderate interest, assess their performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But will collapse, this will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As an evocation of a real story and as proof that it can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on &quot;the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We came up after the last event, the EU plans to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies,&quot; explained pr√°vo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women aventajaban of better prices in the life insurance because they represent a lower risk objectively. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Other great ideas from the workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people until the end of this year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013, &quot;reported Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the EU&apos;s controversial regulations is, for example, adding fuel to the compulsory biocomponentes that, as a result, harms the environment; another is to ban the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shadow the size of cages for laying hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The ban has been criticized for factual use the expression &quot;spread butter&quot; or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb of the shops. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A banana quality must have a length of 14 inches. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The apparatus of the Union takes this kind of decisions, often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher-quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 inches and could not present &quot;abnormal bends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national rules do not homogenized so far, which only complicate their marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the poll might be the prescription of the US last year, according to which the inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The US referred to an American study, according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is also in effect a similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Strange occurrences are born even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: Anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, so as not to offend the sensibilities of Greece, it must speak of FYROM (Former Republic of Macedonia know). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists&apos;aissez ÌïúÏäπÏó∞, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union over the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU found the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey also were interested in the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas emerged in Brussels, but not in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage because they do not have sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We ask the European Union compensation, &quot;he said in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> I argued with the fact that in our country there was a lot of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had filled warehouses and had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The grant proposal was to receive a grant to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU), in particular, is aimed at the drafting of applications for subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and, in addition, a more effective operation and development across the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but the member states have achieved in negotiations on budgets. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Czechs also strikes a chord, in the same way as other EU countries, the fight for the right to the denomination of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc curd cheese, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as &quot;tuzem√°k.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only those products made from distilled from sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU, along with the feta cheese and gorgonzola cheese known all over the world, the German city of L√ºbeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already for example cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho≈ôelice and T≈ôebo≈à, and even the variety of hops from ≈Ωatec. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> As maras protected in the EU, can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and Wafers Ho≈ôice v Podkrkono≈°√≠. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want to save the republic, but I am a fan, says Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how he happened to run in the elections for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not about being a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If in our country were so good, then he would not pursue my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer bear to see how it steals in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> He had no ambitions to be political. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something that I don&apos;t like, try to come up with a solution to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I already have forty years and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that I have to change things is to stand as a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has put on the way to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Not is turning its back on those who have voted? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Precis√© out later that if elected to the Senate, would present my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive down to anyone who wants to initiate a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This is compounded by the media, which undermine and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me, it is said to have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It presents to the presidential struggle with financial theory and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To this must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president does not have this competition, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure to the office of guide was recognized as an autonomous work, and we succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem lies in politics: If someone comes up with a good proposal, whether on the right or left, it rejects on purpose, and this affects citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all the parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party, I have the ability to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Is it considered more of a left-wing or right-wing man? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered more left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> It does not matter to me, whether it be a little left or a little right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters to me is that we come out ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSƒåM or ODS and, by the same token, I am against the bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> A joke when they say to you that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing with what he says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you have also certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And try to get to them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who call populism, but all proposals of which I speak already operate in the world or known experts speak of them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And thus cannot survive in the long-term policy. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that if you are going to the people and talk to them, will, for example, a financial and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If he were elected president, there would be no problem in arranging a broadcast live on TV in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties that lend legitimacy to the financial and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they would have to communicate why don&apos;t want to. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character that points to disputes, pressure can be done on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my opinions and ideals attempt to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just start in politics and try to obtain the greatest possible support for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try to take things forward myself, but if they don&apos;t get it right, within six years, and I will leave it to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a bit like if Okamura would save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that a person does not do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, as if maybe they animaran to stand as a candidate for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Janƒçura, but refused because he had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√°, who brought to light the fraud with light heating oils. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve change. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering forming his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet seen because I don&apos;t have time to do so, to check the past unblemished record of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind, there are only 20,000 kroner transparent. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Don&apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Speaking of declarations of ownership, how is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property in about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin about 3,5 million and a ≈†koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth, I&apos;ve always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the evils and injustices. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Do you take an Aston Martin, his property is valued at $60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the republic but does not want to put too much money on their side. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I have to endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign, I have already put 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that it does not have any sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my program. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I don&apos;t have the obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The costs of the campaign cover in essence what will I receive in salary of senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live in it, for example, would not be able to pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If you would like to just make money, then I would not as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So will continue with its business activity in order to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Wouldn&apos;t have said before that he was going to leave this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has nothing to do with a higher salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, in part I have left my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People wanted to be the Samaritan that saving the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much do you earn each month as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still winning. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, then would leave the business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You can see the entire interview in the Saturday edition of pr√°va. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architectural firm MVRDV, shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed &quot;mountain of books&quot; - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a bystander who goes through the streets. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: &quot;In addition, the building is beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one goes for taste in these libraries pass√©, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having been raised with a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this situation as shameful, some years ago, it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in the euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And that is how policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: He had to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams of buildings and funny and cynical, it took issue with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked puzzled around them and encog√≠a shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: &quot;Dear fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here you have my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called &apos;Boekenberg&apos;. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros is on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the revitalization project, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and detached. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is also nominated for the &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one intuir√≠a rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building now in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right at the centre of the massif, but the true lovers of space and reading does not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his rise to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior is fully glazed light and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor annealing and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public status of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> When you look up you can get to see the banks of the park, the dogs and children playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> All sides and books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done is to put an upside down the classic spatial configuration and remove the reading area from the inside to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is well taken: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, environmental education center and the maintenance room. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Special mention deserve black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and railing at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, touch and smell are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers more civilians per day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And that is how one day, on a farm Friesland, we are met with the appropriate by-product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands used a plastic fabric of few millimetres thick as a base to hold the roots of crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This tissue lasts for two seasons and then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> This is for the library prens√≥ fabric, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates of four centimeters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resistant that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this route continues nearly 500 meters around the mountain reward awaits us: From the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it can also be a tasty Dutch croquettes and ficus planted in huge pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a pleasant atmosphere as well as maintain the atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;Although deduce given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines for only a few hours inside. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The huge wooden cerchas located in transversal sense to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a comfortable interior climate. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is a thing of the automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology, has dared to set foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Similarly, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, she describes the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; as the &quot;soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, he invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> In this way it aims to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have a complete file; currently has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although it is only there to embellish. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a great success in that discipline reigns in the specialized slang is known as &quot;creating an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> No matter how young and uneducated that may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, a starting point for shaping its identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a leading role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US relations. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a very difficult diplomatic position. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the issue was to establish a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally this has been declared by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Do you find it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on major international issues are at stake? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that at the moment is shifting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and by focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what makes things even more is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think we are still exploring what their role, but they have already begun the path towards a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does it mean specifically a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States and its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is to say, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason, you must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor of Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I don&apos;t give so much importance because it is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, it does play a key role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting on important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge level of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a rupture as drastic as in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> In the end, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country that taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, the US has been clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These disparities have always existed due to US domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation that we live here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real disparity of views is not actually the scale that is attributed to him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Do you find it difficult to reconcile the Germany that maintains close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that it is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and homogeneous, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of a larger entity, but should push things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship he has with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a difficult issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans have made clear that they must play the role of an independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Does Germany sees itself in the role of major international actor? Do you want to actually Germany to assume a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps he still finding it difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet been used, it is always a little uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as the main actor, it will unleash certain antialemanes feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the US in European politics increasingly decreases, but the EU does not cover the gap for the time being, who is then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will have no choice but to take on a leading role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they don&apos;t like, if they find it unpleasant or if they become a people even more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analysed the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he has specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Trademark protection&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly in Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Following this name hides a designation officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, this is not protection while the real ep√≥nimos submit a claim. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear that they are going to give the reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with the law firm Taylor Wessing specialising in protection of rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week arrives at my table a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens an archive which holds seats in the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name which is also served the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are world champions in this copy and violating intellectual property rights is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities there are several floors of department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeit. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, the cases are other Pattloch. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> What the Chinese call &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or accompanying brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word has its origin in the Chinese word &quot;Bang Dakuan,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That refers to women who have &quot;fish&quot; to a rich man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for the business, we have to fight against it,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is taking on water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the costs of the sectors affected are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic of luxury products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is in size, the third luxury goods market, which is growing faster. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and involves a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The processes can extend up to nine years, and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name of demand had already been turned into a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;If the plaintiff has bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China,&quot; says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery maker SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the matter was determined in the courts and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China lost against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo was a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademark office in Beijing CTMO recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, &quot;the emergency work returned to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the number of processes without complaint process has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 of those cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81,500 complaints are still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It costs a lot of money to fight </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is usual in China, the numbers are startling. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This would be a new record and means that China is heading for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations around the world, according to the trademark office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 would have pocketed 1,800 billion yuan in the concept of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Fight that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group fight in the courts against a Chinese copycat. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of car parts of imitation, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copier has managed to secure the rights of Chinese on the brand Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the following two instances have given reason to Freudenberg, but the other side is still fighting today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We have to be very careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to resolve the issue favorably and commends the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also states that &quot;the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the company has had to review files of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the opposing party a &quot;six-figure sum in euros,&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but did not succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much we care about,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that lurk in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Specifically, if there are copycats secured the rights to trademarks are not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long abandoned this area, but he managed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We have to be very careful,&quot; said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what we have to do is register in China, &quot;anything that may be subject to protection,&quot; as Wentzler points. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay the opposing party licence fees for its own name, as Wentzler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question expulsar√≠an us of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg tested the chorus Imbongi and exult in Swaziland AIDS orphans </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8.733 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> It starts with the first dance: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and mocasines seek compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then begin to rise slowly, the voices of the singers (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolin√°ndose, entorpeci√©ndose and sigui√©ndose each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, is threatening to pull out of their boxes almost in trying to bring order to his energetic and gentle gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> They have also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om &apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: The Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> For the self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, globally, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> There are 245,000 in Swaziland AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents to 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the tuition of the school, the uniform and I will ensure a hot meal per day in the Gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;narrator of stories&quot; or &quot;panegirista.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> No one in this room knows to speak fluent this Bantu language, but they know how to sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Ten years ago this chorus rehearsal songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to carry them to their place of origin: Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called eSitjeni that depends on the voices of the choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> ESitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The rate of AIDS infection of the highest and lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not wisher circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets that were not only for the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothing and education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child outside the school and enjoyed a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, a year after the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; which has since been occupied professionally for orphans of AIDS in eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial origin of STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> STDs are the most common source of the AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The ladillas and scabies are among STDs transmitted by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European polls, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has evolved the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of cases in 2001 to 1,697 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections continues a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> They often do not cause pain or other symptoms cause and therefore not be detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infections by physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, experts recommend to undergo regular medical examinations, especially if they are frequent changes of sexual partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any late consequence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the chorus for their performances throughout Germany, come to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We have sent a total of about 200,000 euros in eSitjeni already,&quot; says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In his own people Zodwa Dlamini, a woman self-confident and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> That takes care of orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, as referred to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof to live and take care of children go to school every day on time and in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who do not have anyone left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has launched a sewing school, has built two barns and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has made many of the town&apos;s residents have been subjected to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not something obvious, because, although it is clear that this disease across the country, they do not usually speak openly about it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also due to the many seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other, and that they take it wherever they go. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> It is a different culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To promote cultural exchange, Imbongi choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to drag a couple of tears to some rabid border soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey takes them to always eSitjeni, where singers visit children sponsored. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite the fact that this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Come to eSitjeni, there shines the light,&quot; says the people of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after touring the 8.733 miles as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal rooms of the Bergheimer street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the ice cap has a thickness of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also cooled water, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water comes presumably of comets or, in all likelihood of asteroids that smashed against Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, said the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help clarify how they have reached the water and other components of life to other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time send images to Earth: Small windows to the immensity of space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, Ceres is not a &quot;planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; in which appear endless generations of stars: The oldest stars are shown as blue points, although it is more difficult to recognize the pink color of the stars &quot;babies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of star formation, called a little romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This image of a star tornasolada extinction was taken by the NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The ring-shaped is composed of the material that the star spits in its process of extinction. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the huge Misty Tr√≠fida, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The NASA Spitzer telescope took this picture of the area of galactic star formation. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pl√©yades, a group of stars also known by the nickname &quot;The Seven Sisters,&quot; are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, with the telescope can better appreciate the colors. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The Misty the Axial appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is located at 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular colour. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This fledgling star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: How originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It is probably the remains of one of the moons of Saturn who disappeared without trace 4,500 million years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and most sharp pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: The Galaxy of Remolino. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Misty Tr√≠fida located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The Tr√≠fida name comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three), as a dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this area of stellar formation in three lobes. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic snooker: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging abalanzan is the one to the other to finish colliding of irremediable form. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> For those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Misty in the constellation of Cefeo. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than the dust particles that can be found in a house. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created from images of optical and X-rays made by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This cluster of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this fog is the brightest young stars in our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This area of stellar formation constantly produces new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, associated with the Misty Rosette, also arise continually new star; 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole still no dust, gas only. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe could find mostly hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window on the universe: The largest telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer have more depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror in the picture, had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Great Canary Telescope is located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, reaches a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of this construction is more economical than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a comparatively smaller diameter mirror, the capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The ESO also will host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or the European Extremely Large Telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018 is not expected to be able to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> These are two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new and daunting telescope with a diameter of 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is a picture of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990 sends images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, particularly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that since the start of his mission had been located approximately 1,235 candidate planets. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the picture are the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of the space telescope has a diameter of 4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of this telescope will be looking for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The researchers assume that the south pole of Mercury there is also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no hard evidence, because the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades the radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that this is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink butter on a daily basis and live 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> To the south of Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach biblical ages. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> A search for traces in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> To the south of Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach biblical ages. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search for traces in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The tour through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as a wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minibus is moving forward with great din through the winding road that runs alongside wooded hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is located in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here to the border with Iran is only a few kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here are the &quot;talyshi,&quot; one of the people who don&apos;t know much, apart from the fact that the Persian and Azeri and are very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small town boasts a perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era, and that does not seem to fit entirely in a mountainous landscape so picturesque. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists just come to this place, because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> To travel the 323 miles separating the two cities, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The astonishing wealth of the country thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this peripheral region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we celebrate the Feast of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This is the director of the Museum of the ILC, perhaps the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded the 100-year-old. Fatulayeva points to a picture in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> A child died at the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, who seems to have lived 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate that certifies. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of M√ºsl√ºmov is quite suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children, apparently still had time to conceive a child to the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Was it wrong then ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov in his age in a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However, Rembrandt Scholz, geront√≥logo at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live people of very advanced age,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many older men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registry. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day glasses filled with melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to achieve a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why do they live here in the south, so many elderly? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guide explains that these are special genes talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that the diet rich in calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and dairy products, and many of whom, in addition, drink a cup of melted butter on a daily basis, is so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Its 97 years is relatively young for what obtains in these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting on the floor, moving tirelessly a huge tub of butter. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also cavort from one side to the other two small children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea serving in a typical vessels with curved shape. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayeva teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son finds us proud. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed hair with milk, which is why I never has fallen and has maintained its color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used either a shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> It has always eaten only what was in his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my entire life I have never gone to make the purchase at a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then we talk of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was the post-World War II. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> However, all returned to normal when the &quot;beloved father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes to the fatherly figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He remained in power until 2003, when he gave the baton to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least older people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount that you can live well, taking into account the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the white son of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;In our culture, the elderly are highly respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if this were not reason enough to stay alive for many years... </seg>
<seg id="1938"> In the Constitution lack the expression &quot;Human Rights&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division that has gripped the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, with Sharia law as a basis, it is very controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president indulge in pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> &quot;We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God, &quot;he said on public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, secular and enlightened Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them, living without remedy so far in a confusing opposition, they are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what the 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Do you intend to deprive of their power to the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night meeting of 15 hours, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case law is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> However, what does that mean &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and remains open to interpretation, and it seems that the Islamists are going to take this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that involves, to impose a more strict interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least suggesting a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia is compulsory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country&apos;s largest Islamic institution with great power in the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As set out in the draft, the state has to protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that, with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the arts and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> This is not talking about anything other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> In another change prohibits offending or malign the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, it is not clear what is an offense and how it must be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits the &quot;insult to the people&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough of a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to add to his signature and that, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has become&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Weeks ago that the opposition is arrayed against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be &quot;in the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via Twitter accused supporters of Mursi of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;When we called the referendum to his palace and derrocaremos,&quot; says the opposition Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been expiada,&quot; was quoted in the media, the Egyptian opposition politician Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that it wanted to monitor the referendum, so it will not be considered valid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same to the cry: &quot;The people demand the application of the divine law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Add &quot;required to clean up the country,&quot; at the same time proclaiming: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, it would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this happen. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft of the constitution as supporters of same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box what direction the country should follow. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed a majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The expression &apos;Human Rights&apos; even appears&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and have included all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial for Mubarak&apos;s dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because I share their ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this reason, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the expression &apos;Human Rights&apos; does not even appear in the new constitution,&quot; he laments in a conversation with the newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers add to the three powers of the State made this lawyer was resignara. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,&quot; laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, democracy cannot function without the civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could turn against them. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You are discussing a monster that you cannot control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The Norwegian rakfisk: Is the world&apos;s most fetid fish? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Is it possible that the success of the country bears some relation to their greed for an extremely smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of overly cured cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a mountain of clothes wet and dirty football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave it there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Then you can smell the aroma of the crippling rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Is covered with snow, the scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, floating in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water, depending on how smelly that you prefer, up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> And as it is doing more cold, the Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of far more, so to speak, captivating. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;It eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit for a drink,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the &quot;General&quot; Rakfisk, which is in charge of organizing the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Everywhere we see people eating the fish that is kept in small cubes and sipping a drink large quantities of the drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people like more aquavit the rakfisk,&quot; says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I feel some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid it near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and in which, before the advent of refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, lifts and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eats. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until recently not too much richer than Norway, came to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite smelly, from the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive, a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost a whopping 10 euros ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not appear on the agenda of international news and the majority of Norwegians love it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The people here are still not ready to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist acribill√≥ who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, they refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians find it hard to believe that a lot in their country is one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> After much of the current wealth of Norway is the growth, since the early 1970s, one of the oil and gas industries, largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, while going through rakfisk trays and, with his long blond mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;We are, as you say, prudent people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like the majority of people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> &quot;We do not like to boast, we do not like the ostentation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While everyone was dissipating money that he did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed well. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And eating rakfisk,&quot; she adds with an easy laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now a hamburger moose is certainly something different and succulent enough to taste. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But at night, the fish stinks. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I stay is one of the many local held a dinner of rakfisk in which diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the nostrils. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> In a live television has connected with a presenter who leads bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It seems the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here is our score, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls out of the chair, perhaps defeated by aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps the vapors of all that fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico: Enrique Pe√±a Nieto faces a tough start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, prepares to take office, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of its population. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city that, under the best of circumstances, it is already congested, since Monday has been installed a steel fence that cut several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, was not to prevent workers could get to their place of work, but to prevent the protesters were able to reach the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will take over the management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder√≥n, but the country is immersed in a war against the narcotr√°fco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; explained Mr Pe√±a Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr Pe√±a was as governor of his home state, Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions are divided on the new leader in this territory in which he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A sincere man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he recalls fondly. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city you can drive through one of the new roads of Mr Pe√±a Nieto, which represents a huge improvement compared with agrietadas and roads full of potholes that were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Pe√±a Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;Particularly in terms of security and economy, we hope the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It also rejects the rating that the opposition makes lack of substance of the new president. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;It is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has a lot of people about their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> En donde iremos &quot;for Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> High hidden under sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have been left abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr Pe√±a Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, sadly famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr Pe√±a Nieto said, in the best case, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buend√≠a has to make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believes that her partner murdered her. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I came to his house, it seemed as if he had cleaned up the body,&quot; recalls Mrs Buend√≠a. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;There were signs that he had been beaten and rigour de la mort had already been published.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family says that he has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that street. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash that President Pe√±a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico during the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it is the same kind of president who was when he was governor,&quot; says the member of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not reported ill-treatment, according to prosecutors </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to deal with the allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the period of Manning at the military prison in Quantico in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the abuse that now claims that he suffered while he was under military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During the interrogation that the prosecution made to Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein claimed that the records of weekly visits by officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment they received. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted following a request by the defense to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been tough and that it had already provided enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning forms that the officers were following visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was held in maximum detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers would have made questions to Manning and scored their answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Fein on Friday when asked about the forms, Manning admitted that he had described the treatment given to her by the guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received in the facility in general as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms show no complaint of ill-treatment, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and he had indicated that he would try, but they left no record of such issues on the record. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;Writing &apos;smooth&apos; (after having spoken of the problems), but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he had not complained about the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the regime of &quot;prevention of injury&quot; under which was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that he had been put under such a restrictive regime, which is one level below the surveillance of possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to make the state more knew that I was well and (wanted to) must be under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going on or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell only to the Camp Arafjon, this cage,&quot; said Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that only he was allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flops, some clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if the guards could not see his face when he gave a return at night, awakened him to turn around again. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer for Manning in January 2011 filed a formal complaint about the treatment they received Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that he had carried out in Thursday&apos;s statement, according to which, one night after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced during a morning count desdnudo to stand in front of the guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questioning of the judge on Friday, Manning said he thought of the order that gave him the supervisor who was supposed to drop the blanket that could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to stop the fall. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night testified that Manning had withdrawn from his cell in his underwear, his flip-flops and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers have the hope that the judge should have at least considered by the experiences that happened during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if convicted in a court martial, which is scheduled to start early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense claimed that it intends to make Manning is guilty of lesser crimes and defend other charges considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applicable to any person who is under maximum custody at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, causing illegally publishing information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of public property or records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is convicted of all charges, he could face up to life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says that Mexicans are reminiscent of those hard times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen on the esplanade and arrived in the area of immigration processing and was totally confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> A few posters showed the way to two lines: One for &quot;Mexican&quot; and another for &quot;Foreigners.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there for a few seconds without being sure where it should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Having grown up in Central California, all my life I have been called &quot;Mexican.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> These are ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York they call themselves &quot;Italians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided on &quot;Mexican-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> It was simply American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to salir during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can&apos;t get rid of my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and I got in the queue of foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of the day, as always, to meet the leaders of these two countries, included: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pe√±a Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is as likely to remain in Mexico as a Mexican who venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Pe√±a Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably the majority of Americans will never agree to that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind you are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, at the moment in which an officer of the United States says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Are we talking of resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, it may be that the father or mother or any of the grandparents, who closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: Dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> To Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are experiencing is that the American dream, and not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but it is our loyalty. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class the people dislike us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In her view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, would not have gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now we would not be trapped behind this curtain of silk, living in the United States, but, even so, as solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a little girl, I remember that there is this rubbing between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first with more robust know who they are and the seconds that bothers them. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we see as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States are considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to further complicate things, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexican-Americans to work as &quot;ambassadors&quot; of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would say to our fellow Americans, it is fantastic to visit that country and presionar√≠amos political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it will be a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you will be left alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how they treated his family makes a lot less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can be one day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual and useless discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in its former conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has left everything shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that their lethal deadlock could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither lost nor is </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism now seems very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the globe, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine is currently governed by its implacable rival Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of Hamas might come to the conclusion that time is working in their favor. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, Qatar has made him one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The jubilant members of Hamas say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, which dominates the party-militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas&apos;s allies are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and key Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not take too long for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as the player that cannot be excluded, including Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In terms of the military issue, have put Hamas on its site. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Iron Dome anti-missile system in Israel has proven its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israelis will sleep more quiet... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part because of the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a country aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddle these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you really ruled in the West Bank, does not explode rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower in the area is unlikely to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the cease-fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should think in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown is undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as it increases the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution remains the adopted sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must begin to curb the influx of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state status at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr Obama also has an important role in terms of getting to bring Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term failed to submit his own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law of generic packaging of tobacco comes into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs of a dull green, which are the same for all brands of tobacco </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force, replacing the logos and colors of the marks of a wrapper of a dull olive green, some horrifying images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick because they are children of parents who smoke. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the world&apos;s strictest regime applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia says that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Rely on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that it never will. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see that children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand,&quot; said the federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls to do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes do not affect too much to the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for and among covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Mrs Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;For us it is a good business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networking among the demographic sector that is the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, the tobacco marketing has been done online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but it cannot restrict it in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If comercializas tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place in which to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from &quot;ordinary people&quot; posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the WTO issue a ruling in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory include images on cigarette packets. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> There are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia, many smokers are challenging. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;The photographs do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply do not case. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take the cigar and keep the package,&quot; says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;Frankly, there is only one reason that would stop smoking: For my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack shop in the centre of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packs make it more complicated to place them on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Normally took an hour in desenvalar delivery; now it takes me four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have banned tobacco altogether, and then, is already, worth, is over and shut the shop,&quot; says while raises his hands upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the day&apos;s festivities Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which vol√°bamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more scholars and experts in child development to praise the virtues of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is good that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and encourages creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Given that, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experience the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, should we accept in good spirits boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, as we will talk about it later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as he says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book &quot;boredom: A Lively History&quot; (&quot;The boredom, an animated story&quot;) published by Yale University Press in 2011, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii graffiti exist in Latin on the boredom dating back to the first century AD </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We also need to consider how we define the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the research published and raise the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &quot;wanting, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but want to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He points out that with the apathy there is the desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of boredom, he says, is &quot;the alteration of the process of care, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom may sound terribly similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or in the world, while the people who are depressed believe that the problem is with them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when what happens in reality is that we have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study &quot;The unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard in the adjoining room a television programme to any volume that was not any relationship, others listened with the volume low, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group who heard the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; focus cost them, but they were not sure why and what is attributed to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;When you&apos;re trying to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, alteration of care can lead to boredom,&quot; said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;On the other hand, when you&apos;re doing something boring, how to detect defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distract you can help you will not get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;In fact, today we know that move or make scribbles, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help combat it, because it means that that person is physically more alert.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what it is to be bored at some point: The delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a &quot;tendency to boredom scale.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes questions such as &quot;many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I don&apos;t have time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, argues that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically require more external stimulation and more varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in touch with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of teens said that he was bored in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that when stufato was not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what we knew was that &quot;adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest point,&quot; largely due to the fact that both children and adolescents are not gives them a lot of control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my question from the beginning: It is good to be bored? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, we may be exposing absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as shown by the investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boredom is the way that the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you&apos;re bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you see the television, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;So, if your child is bored and you give an iPad, it is possible that they are no longer bored, but will not have learned to entertain themselves or dosificarse,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And that capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child will not only learn how to have fun alone, but they learn to be controlled better in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the trickle of activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;In our view, we need more tiresome issue, but boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing as to connect you with something that is worth,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He points out that what people really want is a way to unwind and enjoy a long dead. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados,&quot; he says, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: Without a book of instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer of south-eastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: The possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke marijuana.. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the border of Kansas, when stopped by the police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (petty crimes that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was told the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They treat us like criminals,&quot; says Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> What are they? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law of the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana they are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, to be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to go ahead with the cases open for possession of marijuana, and people are still quoting. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, a number of cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent open marijuana stores, recently authorized, in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next thing,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> Still looking for advice and to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline, on 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Commission of control of alcohol in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent that we will serve as a model,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, called the I-502, enters into force on 6 December, leaving a year during which nadar√° between two stools, since the licensing system in that state does not yet exist, but the possession is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> In addition, there are some tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, as a way of maintaining a balance between the demands of the state to provide an &quot;adequate&quot; access to marijuana prohibition and authorized to conduct business of cannabis within a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children&apos;s play areas and children&apos;s centers. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere will find it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group created recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to their police officers in which they reported that the prosecutor of the city would take action for misdemeanors for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years old, and that the police would file charges against these crimes &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The chief of police, Oates said that they would enforce the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue pursuing drug dealers and traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has an obligation to take action against those faults which at the time were a crime occurred,&quot; Mr Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response has been difficult even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, County District Attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that you are wasting our time to continue to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> Contradictory reactions that occur throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmental experiment in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;I have spent so much time taking people to court, in fact, still cannot accept that it is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at the national level regarding the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also are very anxious to receive instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of the legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will subside. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite the fact that there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed that there are mostly business selling marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;Although it is likely that the drug agents do not pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,&quot; said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of anti-drug policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to put ourselves in a situation where we are enabling someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are studying what voted in favour of the community to vote in favour of what the state voted. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many questions about this. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I chased until mattress of Oxford for being a Tory&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It attacks the university for their views only now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my elder brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: The free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, the two weeks to occupy my seat at the Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the career of History, had already packed their bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and she broke down in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard claimed that I had left because they did not tolerate that some fellow university kept sex in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I was forced to drink in cups shucked. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Hu√≠ there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes I fled, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Extravagant not because of my name, nor the fact that it had come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was harassed by a single reason, in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You might ask what this is now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is undergoing a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students from grade) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are &quot;often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirable persons&quot; for their political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a seat on the board of equal opportunities for their college to ensure being able to express their opinions freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not aided by a recent BBC2 documentary called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (The paradise: Young, bright and right-wing) on the politics of students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The graduate student showed Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party at the University of Oxford (OUCA) in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a walking stick with a silver hilt. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing trend of left-wing universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says that this is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected president of OUCA, said that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre right has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first few weeks in Oxford I was more than a single. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old terribly shy. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; after cuts in funding from the Higher Education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would have done a shake of Stalinist horror to any. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first days of the week to welcome the new university, when new students are known and unknown to the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors were not only a blind eye to the mockery that was made of the conservative university, but participating in it willingly. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The policy of the miners&apos; strike, privatization and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood of the seminar rooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first thing that I had to translate into English, French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for what came next. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Not say no. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a shallow man with a face that looked like biscuit dough, knew well how to expel bad bile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is it that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that, quite simply, are stupid?&quot; Asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other pebbles university. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> My eyes were burning from the tears that tried to contain. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, as long as they are not too busy knowing people,&quot; &quot;Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room like a banshee. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at dinner time at university; then I felt a slight slap on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he told me kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this is how it goes the thing. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> They pick on anyone who is suspected of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I tried to conceal a cowardly attack. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I emphasised that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick was useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, which, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, he said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took this ditty. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do you have sex the Tories?&quot; Asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;They give a beating each other, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be forced to be with people who think like me only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Does that make me Labour and repress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that I hoped posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also Thatcher adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Was just over there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Hated the place because it was considered provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you&apos;re not going to be happy,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to travel daily from Oxford to my parents&apos; house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends more open metropolitan mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> I am not believed. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he was studying there in the 1940s, he accepted all the political points of view. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But if it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said with sadness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming spires. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Until my friends communists always had an impeccable attitude. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His sore eyes began to nublarse. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Dale another opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that they have done so only to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would break my heart if you desire. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stress was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his faith. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which he hinted at another professor of History, speaking quite seriously, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Red shame inside, admit√≠ my parents that I had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; and called them &quot;old stupid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted only a short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my academic career at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was nestled inside of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When I left the suitcase and I caught the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> He never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I call weak llorona. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But anyone 18 years of age should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but, as of today, nothing is hidden behind a deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> On the occasion of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has recognized during the opening of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;house&quot; for the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this palace,&quot; he says with its unmistakable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This show is the pinnacle of a story whose protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but that could not have been written without their distinguished clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always felt fascination with the distant and rarefied world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, which is open until 3 March, many private letters and photos with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their social promotion: The city of humble dressmaker Rabbi, in northern Italy, idol of the &quot;international&quot; jet-set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> To be in love with royalty is nothing wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least they did not shut down the butts of their bonus on your carpet and make some beautiful celebrities of pop music,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad,&quot; explains the exmujer &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And yet, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the floor, the decor, the food, the music, everything looked and felt his spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; which began to work with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art,&quot; topped off. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of lineage </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Garavani&apos;s life is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves to people with good education and better titles, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models on the catwalk parade and needs to see a &quot;dream&quot; audience that features masterpieces of Valentino, such as Jackie Kennedy chose to dress for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, costumes used Monica vitti in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In that audience of mannequins glitter names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von plane und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Habsburg Sofia. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and dressmaker, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember it well. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest, &quot;Gillette&quot; and a jacket in the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift that he gave me,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer him over others because of their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,&quot; added the former Duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like the colors used, have great light and are &quot;donors&quot; to the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and fashion prescriptora Patricia della Giovampaola d &apos;Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he took a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of having reached the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of her evening gowns. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally the time has come to the end of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first Valentino dress to use at a party at the house of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red dress, with skirt blowing up, &quot;corsage&quot; drapeado and neckline word of honour. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says the widow of Rodrigo d &apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess D &apos;Arenberg keeps his clothes off the dressmaker with &quot;maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories associated with it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as the dressmaker called his seamstresses) to develop this ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four-and-a-half meters. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, the dress represents a milestone in the haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, &quot;the return of the clients of the high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> For years, which is obsessed with the &quot;savoir-√™tre&quot; of the elite, now Valentino is the best example. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the spouses of her clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;I have always been struck by its refinement, its calm, its clean and perfect,&quot; says D &apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;I was flawless, time does not pass for him.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human mules Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health loading 70 kilograms of sulphur through steep stone paths </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work is hell and another that literally works in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> To this end, it has to go down every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies on contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After booting large rocks of sulphur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, carries two bamboo baskets that burden on their shoulders through steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes to rise at a snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance with defining and measuring their steps to tune and not fall over the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any catch could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who despe√±√≥ years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur that extract </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once above, open passage between the tourists that the photograph as if they were circus monkeys and laboriously carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and never better said, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As is normal loading 70 kilograms, about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually make three doors a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> It takes three hours in each and ground ends, but allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, is triple what would win in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The hire of the miners is very high here, where the harvesting of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the coal was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulphur: &quot;I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and irritate the eyes by the toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In its 27 years, Anto carries three playing in Kawah Ijen his skin, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and irritate the eyes of toxic gases that the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price we must pay in order to achieve his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; promises a more than acceptable in English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished for life, this could be sympathetic and intelligent young tour guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead makes the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing a unclean wooden hut with other carriers, rises every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shadows, Anto alumbr√°ndose low to the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has purchased with their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters carry baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur in order to save costs nor provides any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and both the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, not even being part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charged to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the beasts, and not for the people,&quot; protest Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier that has been in Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide working &quot;everything it can&quot; because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind suddenly changed and traps miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Swinging the basket on his back, already Unainik can only carry 50 kilograms to his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his colleagues start 15 tons of sulphur at the volcano, three trucks to move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away from a path of goats in the bush. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I don&apos;t jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life,&quot; proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where we are missing several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of their five children, the eldest, 30, also works loading sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery passed down from generation to generation, one of the toughest jobs in the world: The making of Kawah Ijen human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, the fulfilment of our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an announcement of mint tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as &quot;We will put a Bao (bun in the oven&quot; to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem in a fun way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill their national duty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is purely on the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue that we had to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings quick quotes (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative as possible in order to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> It&apos;s not taken so lightly is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and doles out tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2 - known as reposici√≥n- rate was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> As Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and parenthood, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to drastically increase immigration to deal with the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to build as many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoebox,&quot; that can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family members. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company THE Developers, said that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are sold much faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed out </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they are not going to have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting off,&quot; says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as much as the government tries to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are those who have the final word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The private off line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espa√±ola is the quality of private or &quot;the sphere of private life that it has the right to protect any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for a 16-year-old girl? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in their daily lives and in social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Can you see the dangers to which it is exposed to air on the internet situations that surely not share it offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> ElPeri√≥dico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases, associated the term &quot;something very mine,&quot; on the personal level, and &quot;in the key and user name,&quot; when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets does not rise to a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when trying to explain the meaning of private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not everyone,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In FB gets pretty images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also entretengo with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I would share a picture that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or writing violent or humiliating comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge claims to know the 35 friends in FB and his nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened Twitter to express myself and write tweets interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if I answer, I just go,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Do not hesitate to answer that would never accept a request for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Nor would you if someone to recommend to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Joseph, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not know 20 people added to his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has hinted or asked for the address of your home or your phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I had put pressure or I simply demanded the sack of my mind,&quot; he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy did not fall outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> An acquaintance of my friend were extorting in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;Never knew who he was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Joseph, not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;Only put privacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike George, this boy would rise known photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes I would, if I fall ill or I want. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that this is ciberbullying,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, a master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They are digital natives, children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a definite opinion about what should or should not disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not provide for that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy for children and adolescents is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so does not,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists some options: There are things that don&apos;t contar√≠as to a stranger, why do you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, do you would like to publish a photo of yourself as you have made a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When photos of party labels, do you have requested permission from the other people to label them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more, all they need to know what you&apos;re doing every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, should be equal in social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance, </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Queen of Scots Guard, a university professor, elementary teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly the policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> To understand each of the snippets they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guard, is key to remind the children the lesson of &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without being made public the Declaration of Lima, announced previously and theoretically signed by the seven leaders attending. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> He repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry sources and presidency initially pointed out that they were going to deliver after the closure, but later claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> To be consulted by the text, said that the contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, for a few brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information from the summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;private session, audio restricted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by press spokesmen for some of the governments of the Unasur attending the appointment, though not the Peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA, and on that occasion, despite being required repeatedly by the press, nor spread also called the Declaration of Lima, who had previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both of these international events, the Peruvian authorities made certain that had insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court in The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which starts on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that today we are going to the international court,&quot; said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,&quot; he added Pi√±era, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week that the Pact of Bogot√° that had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which was seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held with absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midday of Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The president read the final document in which reported that 16 were adopted and agreements were fixed lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the resolutions adopted mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will give &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It was reported that &quot;promote actions to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity and citizen against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the internet at a low price in all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our peoples,&quot; he added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> In addition, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country to their reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Latin America&apos;s need to remain as a region of peace and prosperity, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting their participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat with respect the maritime dispute following a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to review all of these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would be on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> In addition, as part of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defense ministers met in advance to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot;South America, in this case, yes, you should learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, told state TV that &quot;Europeans were killed in the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship initiative to encourage the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>

<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States,&quot; he said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but it has respected its &quot;deep democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that, at the time, &quot;there was reasonable suspicion that Assange was extradited to a third country and not respect for their process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice to demand that it put on its territory to the interrogation of an alleged sexual offence &quot;when the Swedish legislation allows you to do it by video conference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that I had a small problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger that deteriorates their physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This complicates the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto that allows you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We don&apos;t negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange&apos;s lawyer, a√±os Garz√≥n, is doing a series of procedures in different European institutions,&quot; he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And opined that &quot;if Britain gives the security clearance this morning is running out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as well as to their legislation, as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow will end this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Strap used to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and explained that it &quot;does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which infringe freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians but bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> At that point they are no longer welcomed these journalists &quot;neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador,&quot; and said it would be re-elected &quot;will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next election, to argue that the agency &quot;must be strong and do not tolerate opportunism and marbled the legality&quot; because in reality &quot;shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian president was also perfectly &quot;relevant&quot; to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>

<seg id="2768"> You have to process them so wide to overcome them and move on. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> It also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that kept in the same court, Peru and Chile and opined that &quot;it is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is&quot; hard to fault. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility that is present as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said that he sees that possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Personally, I was never interested in power, but in situations such as the unjust socio-economic poverty in Ecuador that can only be corrected from political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My movement Montcada 6 believed that it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept that liability questions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> To win it would be my last period in the presidency and hence we leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> And if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is a decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicol√°s Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS are now because of late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if I dropped a bomb,&quot; referring to the recalling the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do more &quot;suavecito&quot; without apparent success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take charge of their illness and began to learn about it; with such efforts already celebrated his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, until the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided bid farewell &quot;because it contained a cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignorant of his illness, many people still come when the virus has already wreaked havoc, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least for the first cases reported, &quot;the great achievement at the moment means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infect√≥logo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement of the immune system with patients at the start of the diagnosis, with best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years ago, when they report 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple words, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, under these terms, &quot;while remain in control can live without problems until the age of 75 years,&quot; explained the interviewee. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For sizing this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> While the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however it ensures that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why there are still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - To me, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This view, so we has happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients are very advanced unknown because their state of infection, or in the late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He gave a blunt fact: &quot;Nine out of ten patients arrive when you have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make more early diagnosis and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all the people who need it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a private laboratory, only motivated because I had made a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancerous growth that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some people think that they are going to die and don&apos;t want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am going to die, I better reviento three times a week,&quot; they say, not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, good food, I exercise, I take the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but shares, I would certainly to me and the other person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> To take the test, if they were at risk, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, it is better and if they already have a diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This, his message, sums up the theme of the AIDS battle this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The counter condoms </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are large gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken up the cause Tapatio around HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the largest is in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places dedicated to this task &quot;actually has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is all well and good, but it turns out that there are those who today still do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What do they want?&quot; Is a common question, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, who did not want to expose teenagers, said the communicator. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to redirect this inefficient allocation; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in public bathrooms dispatchers sites that frequent the young. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Nor is pay the chelas and the motel, and said the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez, to ask him if he would have distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already engage in a sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Keys In Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is fourth place nationally in cumulative and new cases of AIDS and 13 ¬∞. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infection is sexually, 6% in the blood and 2% to the perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV because there is one case recorded by 4 to 5 people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a US appeals court ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the stage set a bad precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It would seem, then, that the procedures in endorsement of survival of firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, against the grain of international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican firms face the possibility of seizure of their property beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First of all, as long as the trial judge noted that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial competition processed in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean to ignore the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trans-national profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, to that end, they created the UN Model Law for the Distribution Uniformity of International Commercial Law, acting as an arbitrator the American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote intercompa√±√≠as, recognized in the critical mass of commercial debts that they had with their parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had not been achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the possibility of the Mexican laws recognize. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which it accepts the scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompa√±√≠as endorsed the Federal Institute of Competitions Mercantiles. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> What is certain, however, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the Courts of the United States, that is to say, &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> It omits the fact the Court of appeals. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another angle, he blames Vitro of the difficult situation they faced from 2008 to only glanced at the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where he received blows the barbs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> Meanwhile, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family appealing for reconsideration before the appeals court so that the vote comes to full, that is to say the five judges, given that only three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> It will not prosper the Cerciorare resource that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> How serious the case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Competitions Mercantiles, pointing out that this case involving with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Law of bankruptcies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Moreover, it is pointed out that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Billiards two bands: In Vitro hit them and hit them into the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General balance </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Shelved for several months reports placed on the table by the Mexican unions against the Aviation exdue√±o, Gast√≥n Azc√°rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of airmen already found the bottleneck. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The analysis, led by Carlos D√≠az Ch√°vez Morineau just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Securities and Banking Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to give reports to the Attorney General&apos;s Office on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract the trust F / 589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviacion 198 million pesos. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The resources have been channelled to the purchase of shares in the Professional Administrator Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As you know, Azc√°rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> The Dragon Mart surround </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> We are talking about, as you know, a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country&apos;s products of the wall, with an area of housing to match for employees of 150 companies. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball has been my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotting basketball Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the tabloncillo sport and, thanks to him, he traveled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball is as broad as the Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And that is before a stroke would it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, it was as a player of minor categories, the National Basketball player, possession and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros of Bayam√≥n or president of the Basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s,&quot; recalled Reyes Primera Hora during a visit to his home in Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes did not exaggerates when making such a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias that indicate his long career, prove it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> In all, which holds more excitement are those that recall its passage through the Vaqueros since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;Those were my best years, I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight championships Gorchakov since 1967, whether as a proxy, coapoderado or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships shifted from 1971 until 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then on took over &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great manager, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had headed here and I was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;You have a good strong player, 6 &apos;7&quot; tall. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want to? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players of Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse enjoyed it, but at a distance, as in 1988 was already in federal supremo. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By that time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when he won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and should have been bronze if not for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Does this group of the 1990 World Cup National Team is the best you&apos;ve seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won and we gave him a gold by the team from the United States, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze medal in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and &quot;Picul√≠n&quot; (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) &quot;To√±ito&quot; Columbus and James Carter young people, the brothers Leon (Francis and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to be in the 90 due to an injury in the knee. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Olympic of the 1995 in Neuqu√©n, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Paul Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner youth to replace the players suspended by the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What has been the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, this has been Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that&apos;s not counting his career in different leagues that played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Young people, I like very much the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What you think your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN took up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you had to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, the boys of Ponce played only in your area and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the children travel and play too much unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruit of compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> That I am pleased. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> As much as I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> The the CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The phrase &quot;Who shot J.R.?,&quot; designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman&apos;s character was nearly killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars in risky gambling houses. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> It also helped give the series a record audience at that time. </seg>

<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R,&quot; Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should say: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only negotiated that lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, one of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone &quot;huge, both inside and outside the screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky. </seg>

<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart charm√© decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the long &quot;countdown&quot; of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which they have clung many people as proof that it is the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But charm√© had no idea of what is expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot;deudarmaged√≥n&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that will start the Apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there has been,&quot; said charm√© this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what has been happening in the world today, as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory, the last of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple, the associate professor Barry vacker is teaching the course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, could ignite a war. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; said vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Professor of the History of Latin America, Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made team to teach a course, titled simply &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Don&apos;t add &apos;2012&apos; for always having the option to teach the course again, in the event that the world will not end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;impending ruin,&quot; students should study, generating projects and taking final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no other option than to students work &quot;until the same night in which it is assumed that the world ends,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Became saturated in two hours,&quot; said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We receive e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people asked if there was still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console themselves to themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said she had seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a class that could teach it,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project focused on the Mayan prophecy and desacreditamos it in a certain way,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a final year student at Temple, 21, of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;Elsewhere, people don&apos;t think about this,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In mostly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph were, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, &quot;people will start to think immediately in the next date&quot; or philosophizing that on 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said they plan to go to parties &quot;of the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe call some friends to riamos us together,&quot; said Samira Ford, a student of communications for 20 years. </seg>
