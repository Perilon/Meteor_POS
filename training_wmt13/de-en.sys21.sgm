<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the latter holds the Brennan Center for a myth, as it confirmed that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Republican lawyers have recorded in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 has announced new laws which hinder the process for the registration or the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition to these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote annulled the right to register as voters on election day and citizens to file a court denied the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants to purchase an identity card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state that has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years encouraged them in 34 states draft laws that allow voters to provide photo identification showing. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters who lack photo identification issued by a government authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Beyond Neuwähler five million in 2012 do not have such a permit. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to receive the required identification. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students that are seen as voters cast their votes for Democratic candidates increasingly are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification issued by its creation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states it would unite members of hunting or fishing, the stronger for the Republican side chose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to introduced such a demand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states have also sponsored legislation that was abolished the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups limited to provide assistance to those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaign for voter registration in general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 has been reduced by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Republican lawmakers in five other states have also passed laws designed to shorten the period of the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the whites, who constituted 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, have opposed the Democratic legislators and their supporters with the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require showing a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> But the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the influence of the results in the 2012 crucial states passed laws and see them as a clear objective. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws, account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: The test should be done or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test do indeed sometimes faulty results, with false negatives and false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided men already for the holding of early detection tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be done or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States passed a series of disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that is the likelihood of forming metastases by 30 to 40% higher under observation after 12 years if no screening has been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 40 or 50 years, if you have a direct relative, who had already been diagnosed with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men Afro-American is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive and other cancers, the Indo seaside. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient has to really understand the extent of the risk of cancer will be made by him pointed out the possible options, in which prostate cancers can remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in this case you would rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today is taking place in many men, in which it has detected cancer, no treatment, as her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active surveillance in them and offers a treatment for them in progression of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="68"> It determines the criteria for deciding who should and cannot be treated with increasing accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the most important thing is to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society of Urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / FR / man-health / pros Tate-cancer screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention of the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise at least 50%,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unknown. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> There is also a risk factor for several other cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It severely harms people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; regrets the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: The abandonment of the cigarette after 10 years, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem to increase the risk of breast, bowel wrath, mast Speiseröhren-, pancreas, colon cancer and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer wrath,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, salting and drying can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the latter can damage the cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another likely showed an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also been shown yet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family history. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs analyzed only 1 </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons last summer has a certain amount of consternation, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> We believe, in fact, that only 1 is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And, after all, is the last particle predicted that the existence of the standard model of our best or &quot;least bad&quot; declaration of nature and the behavior of matter, but was not yet observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But it is not yet fully safe for the physicists that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs tetraquarks strongly resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented in this week of a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are still missing data to be completely sure about that. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We are still working on the assumption that it really is the Higgs, as apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is about. </seg>
<seg id="112"> This means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time, there is an inevitable past law in this world. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to break this rule, and don&apos;t try too hard, because you are hurt themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world turns out that such a law applies to them too: The Pauli&apos;s exclusion principle that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they find themselves in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; largely consists of some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis share the particle physicists into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens be described as a Fermione, and obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they can, in fact, are in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons members, according to the Web site, The particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The mesons, which we will not treat here and the &quot;force&quot; that spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs particle tetraquarks related in some way. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be stressed, however, that these particles are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this story, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the &quot;light particle,&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If, in fact, a particle accelerated with an electrical charge or change the way the electromagnetic field will come to this place was &quot;upset&quot; about like a pebble thrown in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons &quot;winner of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true for the Higgs only 1, with the difference that must be &quot;disturbed&quot; another field, the Higgs field, so that shows that only 1. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen needs to reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be only a very large rock mox. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Therefore, the Large Hadron Collider, a giant particle accelerator as the CERN required is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd again. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all materials and not all particles that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do this, but others not, for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For what all this research can now be &quot;good,&quot; asks Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they allow physicists to closely examine all deviations from the observations and predictions of SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also many physicists eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open the door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and fill some holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for dark matter and gravity (ups!), which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, at CERN, such differences were not found until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact gave us the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first time line laser (NI) were the first - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a &quot;laboratory&quot; gimmick. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> Applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, Willard Boyle again in 1969 during his work has developed a small light sensor in the optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as &quot;eye&quot; and has earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Le DAAD | palliative care - the best way to die... </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;death with dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of the life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed in the near future, although a bill being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, there remains much to be done in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The DAAD tried to look at this more. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie yet. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, which he aufzehrte, had left him a two-year period. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years,&quot; he said, half-hearted, lying in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: An immense weakness prevents alone to go to the toilet, and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he agrees to be resigned to help with food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He even managed to smile and to talk with the stranger who employed around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea because this is humiliating,&quot; he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> For some people, going back to the early stage is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept a retrograde step, he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because in the view of several people who work in palliative care, major events taking place in the midst of these setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients admitted in palliative care for the home of Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage they are inundated with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care by doctors and nurses who care about them, not more. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear of dying &quot;deliberately and through asphyxiation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But by the disease, I really know my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good kids,&quot; adds them. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wish more in life,&quot; she says, before she accepted that it acquires a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is expected in the next few days still a last visit to her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the home of Victor-Gadbois it offers assistance in terms of food intake and body care with a group of volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The relatives will be used if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to make the death more pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec comes on a bed for the relatives of state aid. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, given that one day we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It gives the dying according to an oral care with Pepsi or brandy. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, Mr X serves a beer, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help families and patients alike,&quot; said Nathalie Savard, nursing director. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At the home of Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man at the age of 93, the last family gathering in the courtyard is well supported by his pillow, while you do in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, died tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months are three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients at less than 45 years of age,&quot; agrees Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, that is, to a care that is supposed to relieve the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of her life, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Association for palliative care home in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This ensures that several major shortcomings in the Quebec healthcare in palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care, before you accept, move on euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, have I seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, but that it has taken measures to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival of Richard Hélène were already minimal when it has canceled an arduous chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin that I will cancel the treatment, she told me that they regret that I abandon the fight, told them. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, they had told me that I was in the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses, that it has not granted this wish, after a team of palliative care have been relieved of their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said clearly that the relatives in pain treatment is not Janet Quarton. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After former Monereau, head of the company&apos;s relatives of the domestic relatives of Montreal, 8% of patients are not talking to a pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often returned to the terminal sedation, which amounts to the patient either permanently or sporadically until the time of his death einzuschläfern. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain will not be relieved say all the same sentence: &quot;I will die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean that &quot;I want you to euthanise me,&quot; but &quot;I want my alleviate pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals on a large scale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the Office of road construction, Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer of political parties and the Italian Mafia experts tell every day, what they know about a great &quot;system&quot; of companies that are involved in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry,&quot; which was very expensive for the taxpayer in the province of Quebec, Canada, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures,&quot; a small audio recorder Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was uncovered by him for a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts to road construction in Quebec, the former prime minister had agreed only reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the study in 2010,&quot; he said, &quot;the Department of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion to the treaties,&quot; because some zügelten their instinct to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already brought two mayors on a case,&quot; he adds, in the hope that it will be able to &quot;demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, they carried out house searches piles and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal assemblies as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts repeatedly. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Engineers were also specifically accused of road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the functioning of the &quot;system,&quot; he said to the maintenance of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has received several years in Montreal 3% of the value of contracts linked to the Mafia with a paid agent who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Beitrag Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000&apos;s, when he was more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberal landslide in power at the time. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraising for the liberal former Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described it in detail before the Commission: In ten years he received gifts from contractors, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as 736.000 dollars in bribes in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road office have admitted that they could lubricate themselves by making the bills with false services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Martin Dumont, an organizer of the party of the mayor, accused Mr Tremblay that he has deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with black money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, and Montreal crashed into a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal.. was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As the mayor of the city district, in the eastern part of the island, Rivière-of-Prairies rejected themselves in 2010 against the sale of municipal land that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million in property developers in the booming real estate market. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of black money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> In the study, carried out in the end, she says that she is &quot;on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the system of ants under his hands to stop the evil and to expose the guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> It says that the procedure was &quot;painful but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are about to clean the wound but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as an oversight to prevent a return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> It is clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part in that, &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is especially concerned about the role of &quot;office holders who are aware of the tactics,&quot; if they were not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec a small audio recorder he: &quot;I was told that it was just a poor substitute of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, which, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: &quot;As long as the campaign spending are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the procurement and funding of political parties: &quot;We cannot fall deeper; when we get to the bottom of the things with courage, can we rebuild the house on a more solid footing with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story damages that Montreal and Quebec&apos;s international reputation, Mr Duchesneau urges people to laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season with PSG have taken on a new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players are coming. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I make progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has given me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements spur me every day to improve my game level. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game, this is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything is very fast. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not suspend in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Jeff... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer&apos;s newcomers are accustomed to carry games to very high levels. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The result is that a player as I must provide the forehead and wants to do his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> It gives me Carlo Jeff a lot in terms of my game position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Jeff is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Jeff instills respect all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the top rider. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: In this way we have qualified for the first knockout round. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we will have our say against very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to be first in our group before Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth final home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can be a great European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already had the budget for that... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To be a great European club has to win the Paris title and make a name for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a huge failure, not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case during the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really close to our hearts, that title match. </seg>
<seg id="295"> During the last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally you should be masters with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But those of Montpellier, another team, has made an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux contending for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> If, however, we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it still is something that one can accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never win 4-0 with every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to draw up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have proven strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the first knockout round, and made the huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not well during the last season, were made by this new PSG &quot;geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, it speaks of a &quot;real-dependence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that this season is powerful and shoots many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has therefore come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> We respect both the player and the person within the team. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their game level. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you experienced with the French national team&apos;s Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was very important to me to participate in the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, it has prevented me from my injury, beat out a season. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things there, from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was my hope with the &quot;Bleus&quot; since my inauguration. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what we have learned our lesson and now we need to show exemplary behavior, occurred in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to make any comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved his goal by he had qualified for the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that the &quot;Bleus&quot; Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> This is forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1: 1) an opening game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has used for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before that meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin is possible without bank payment and selling </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange between the parties on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Furthermore, it is a political vision, as so often in these technologies tangible: The belief that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, the invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros and so on) and a protocol for the secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a gift or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the Bitcoin rate had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later on $2 before he has now recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world of real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies has shown interest in this. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She describes Bitcoin as &quot;the greatest success with the virtual currency,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that are used to move forward in a game that you can win by playing or buy back (and sometimes exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin auditors, trustee of the invoice book at the same time, money-issuers and buyers and sellers are all network nodes. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the account book spread across the entire network of public accounts are available. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task, which will start on the computers, with the winner, who is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a fragment of the file, or the conversion of a large file in a short and clear electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers will &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number to her, &quot;hacked&quot; before the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this number is found, the other nodes can easily examine whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user wants to pay less than 10 minutes to cheat twice (quickly) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is still no link, as both have different fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation will be halved this reward on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The circulating Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some leeway. </seg>
<seg id="380"> It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the performance. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and robbed the Bitcoin deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used vulnerability is not the proper protocol,&quot; Pierre Noizat insured, the very Paymium has introduced, this is a company to pay with real money and uses the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Cash also rejects these shortcomings, however. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations this. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They are accepted by others, such as the blog WordPress platform. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> A &quot;mega-sales&quot; was launched in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; is pleased that Bitcoins Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul converted into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system Paytunia corresponds to a mobile phone with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment, but uses Bitcoin validation of the transactions that are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner also manages its identity, and can therefore remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can be easily implemented with retailers, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They must simply gives an address, which can be identified and photographed by a telephone &quot;, Pierre Noizat assured that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> It is a general trend where hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems be reconsidered. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take some time before the Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB sees in her report, by the way, to re-evaluate the various, today as highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have withdrawn from the country. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after that? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left Afghanistan in the Kapisa and Surobi) in their area of responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States are likely to follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to take back the property of their territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without all of us expected. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished Afghan farmers in particular, as we have seen them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, and the injured and crippled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who refuse an armed international presence, as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their secular and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries to be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill with almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The lorry exceptionally from helicopters and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, there will be no receive more of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups covered by the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The takeover was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The key figures of the anti-Soviet war have come back to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into this racket in that they have seized land from the government to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have discredited themselves, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> As I have heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, as those who have been able to leverage the American contributions: The flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has a population of 5 million, which is one-fifth of the population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the public schools are full of girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> These young people, who do not want to return to the old parties obscurantism nor for the corruption of some executives, you will need to provide jobs. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed factions, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is seen everywhere. </seg>

<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle to strive for the restoration of the militias in the province, which are beyond the power of the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities was supposed to benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of Western nations, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the US would make him a centralised state with a strong presidential alga Walt. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially during the elections planned for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country since the 1950s and long before it is dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage plants are absent and important irrigation system has not been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables will produce nothing. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative will be given the priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to seize his. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on the spot, or no mining is possible without means of transport for export across the mountains. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The great and powerful&quot; leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While lawmakers and civil rights groups to discuss what benefit brings the law on compulsory language tests for migrants act criminals already with fake certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left behind in the home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> On December 1, a law in force, according to which each migrant work must take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> So far, this rule only applies to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, the tests with the time according to Föderaler migration authority should be compulsory for all guest workers in the future. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It not only language tests, but tests in the Russian history and store the foundations of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Language skills must be found for both the conservation and the renewal of work permits. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Also exempt from this legislation are those who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Problem, meaning and protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> Ask the entirety of the examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language and the Russian University of friendship, the St. Petersburg State University, the Moscow State University, and other nations are Russian universities. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The migrants can take the tests in all cities, already more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Civil rights activists, however, questioned several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What is it all about? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes is the requirement to show language skills for both the Russians and the guest workers? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, say the migration authority spokesman, go to reduce the number of forced laborers. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers,&quot; says the head of the Federal Migration Board representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. </seg>
<seg id="606"> However, their rights must be protected even before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only organized recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Sebelew is convinced that a future generation without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a narrow, dark shack, where he will sit with dozens of unmatched months without food and documents and slave 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We get many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In the home you promised the One and, upon arrival, you cheated, decreased their passports and will not get the promised salary,&quot; the Tajik migration authority confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration, Tolib Schwaripow. </seg>
<seg id="612"> No grumbling, chief. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Yet to many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express written in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much her fault, rather than the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only provide a sound basic education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Because there is not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school clothes. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As a teenager, these children will take the first opportunity to earn money immediately. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;It is difficult without knowledge of the language,&quot; to give them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Civil rights activists say the following important aspect in terms of the law. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The test must drop only immigrants with legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> You do not have that status, so there is no investigation and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile keeps the bulk of guest workers remain illegally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome&quot; or &quot;access to banned unauthorized individuals&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It also costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> You can quickly and simply make a fake registration for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The staff of the Russian police know that, for the most part, our documents forged and that we will emerge from this and are not registered cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,&quot; says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;merely spare no expense for false papers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> Earlier on the day the law in force, turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Some fake certificates that certify the completion of language tests have already been hijacked by employees of the Federal Migration Authority. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners of this not for nothing: Every migrant hoped to be able to save that the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant work three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights groups agree. </seg>
<seg id="637"> For the moment, the authorities promise only guest workers covered by the test for the first time that you have time for a basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Newcomers without language skills are also offered places in areas where people with no active communication is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Interior ignored illegal arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> Share of legal weapons in crimes very low </seg>

<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are convinced that private gun owners for a tightening of the law will not deter criminals to serve on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> At the moment, you can find every possible weapon for little money, according to the authors, in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Home Office said that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From the factories to the officers </seg>
<seg id="653"> The weapons reach through multiple channels on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="654"> There are five main channels, Viktor Baranez tells a former colonel, was active in the Education Ministry and the General Staff of the ten-year period. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot takes on a Web page, the weapons orders </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first channel is the army or the military, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves,&quot; says Baranez. </seg>
<seg id="658"> On the second channel, illegal weapons, the vigilante will be stolen by criminals. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranez explained that these are weapons that were stolen from both chambers from the arms of the police force and directly by employees of law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> For many military camps often came to explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There is evidence that some cases was arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons,&quot; says the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Make a contribution to the black market under Baranez arms manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Today there are countless private arms factories that do not meet the international competition and therefore the weapons dump under the hand on the black market, not only in Moscow,&quot; the expert said. </seg>
<seg id="665"> The smuggling is another channel of the black market. </seg>
<seg id="666"> In particular, many rifles and pistols come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is one of their own, some small-scale production, as well as a mafia that organized the smuggling,&quot; explains the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts calculated how much each of the five channels has roughly to the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="670"> In 2011, a report was submitted by the Centre for problem analysis and public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal State Statistics Service, American literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal arms comes from the army and the legal protection authorities, according to investigators. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of all weapons on the black market are going through the &quot;guilt of those found in their work to do with weapons,&quot; the report states. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, the data come from 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% from illegal excavations. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A sales manager of a store of weapons, does not want to be named, assured that weapons found at illegal excavations dreams about buying because they are outdated. </seg>
<seg id="676"> According to him, it is more common for dealers to obtain a weapons cache in the supply. </seg>
<seg id="677"> She bought a weapon, for example, a TT-type gun. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;The retailer sells them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines and puts the weapon in the city,&quot; he told </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;The police know, of course, know about everything and, therefore, if they cannot meet the plan to the discovery of crime, periodically check purchases by traders who offer illegal weapons,&quot; adds the sales consultant. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As the luxury shop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> Buyers and sellers are most often about friends to each other. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I had looked at websites and blogs, when someone became aware of me and I proposed to reach the station &quot;Begowaja&quot; where a person would wait for me that would go to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the weapon I was only there </seg>
<seg id="685"> Military commentator Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="686"> &quot;In order to get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts,&quot; says the technician. &quot;I have a friend, but I don&apos;t trust him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go out and find themselves with a code as &quot;Ivan melt of potassium, lithium, and scandium chloride, the target that the daughter has lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> I am now even in some key rings on a friend that I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He gives me the key rings also is only because he knows that I don&apos;t verpfeife. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he wrote an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes have not changed according to him. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He got a photo album, in which &quot;everything possible&quot; was shown. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like in luxury goods,&quot; recalls of military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer gets loud Baranez rather than a pig in a poke can try everything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I buy a potential customer rather than simply drive the seller in the forest, and there is a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other,&quot; the expert describes the action. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Buy from the sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> Internet search engine show search results pages and groups in &quot;Vkontakte&quot; where weapons &quot;offered for different purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> It will not need any papers there are still personal meetings. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;You need just the right amount of money,&quot; says in the advertisement on the website &quot;battle to buy a rifle or pistol.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> There are questions and give users on your orders. </seg>
<seg id="703"> It will also be sold to minors. </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Of course without a license,&quot; asks users &quot;Ivan The direct quote). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;buy a TT. Moscow&quot; is the laconic question of &quot;Fedorenkow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Security Service shut recently countless bogus websites and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service are crowding into the net. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The people are as hungry feeding fish and land in Siberia and allowed coal scoop </seg>
<seg id="708"> Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard about the following way: The site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The leaders take the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer transfers the money at a bank machine. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;When it gets a photo and a description of the gun,&quot; said the press spokesman of the nonprofit organization &quot;Pravo na Verstecks oryzhie&quot; Dmitri Kislow. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranez stressed that if you placed a question on a website, you can finally get behind bars and left out in the cold. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service shut recently countless bogus websites and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service are crowding into the net. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The people are like hungry fish at the feeding and land in Siberian labor camps and not digging coal,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="716"> A Makarow for $100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of illegal firearms is expected, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 U.S. dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to the organization &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; Dmitri Kislow, you can buy a Makarow pistol type for 100 to 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> You have to wait up to a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The weapon is spent in military arsenals of middle-class supervisors. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal arms throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand back, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and devices fell by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the US strike fast-food and supermarket employees </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting at one point behind the box office of Mc Donald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the past few days came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell further, or whether they will soon return to the air. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several leftist organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of modest wages of the organizers of the protests following simple Walmart- and fast-food workers to form unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy is hardly union. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the millions of customers, the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States Ausverkäufe four that sometimes to Handgemengen led. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, down their work and his along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets are low and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells all products from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Why buy a lot of Walmart-employed only slightly paid at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often only as good as the employees are paid poorly. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about severe conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants in the protest on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the contribution for the operation of their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart employees, earned 9.5 U.S. dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is about 1.1% more than they donate to pay now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart would fully popped the wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future. </seg>
<seg id="743"> A year would be the only 12,39 dollars for more spending compared to today. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that it only came to protests in nine states and that the company made no losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took the next day in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and during this period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Walmart-funds on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing banks post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action merely &quot;another PR stunt&quot; was the union that organized the protests. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York on where their goal but not Walmart stores, which are not desirable and so far lacking in this progressive city, but McDonald&apos;s and others were inexpensive restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says the company sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> The minimum wage is currently under federal and New York law at $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> At fast food restaurants, the minimum wage will be increased gradually, but not too much, and received an average $8.90 an hour their simple employees in New York. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As it is possible to manage in New York with so little money is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school stood behind the counter at McDonald&apos;s, however, the young people still live with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s constantly people complain that they have to manage with that wage and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protest, which began at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald&apos;s in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanding that the cooks and cashiers get a minimum wage of $15 an hour of fast-food restaurants, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The American law bans corporate management to stand in the way of that goal and admonish or fire union members. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the management is not easy for them. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> There have been vocal protests on that day and in many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council member Jumaane Williams said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says that it sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we should work together to support fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves. </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to The New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people on the ground, not all of which by far are employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all mass. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately above list&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> More recently, the popular among supporters of modern technology issue of the enlarged reality is usually seen through the lens of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First presented a working model to Google in the summer at its annual conference in November, it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It irritates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please describe briefly, which conducts research your group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are looking at the interaction between man and machine, however, this would expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the human race is largely stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens that can sometimes be touched. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and gamescom sensors are a step forward, and today is no longer Xbox sold without gamescom, as are all interested in motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although: The interaction has brought on a physical level is much more on the flat, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input of information (the system) gets more data could be improved, the issue has not decisive. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, work on real 3D display systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We have to fire our physical world in the computer world and make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, it is necessary that not only the user but also its surroundings is detected. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could supplement the real world much easier with virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost, we should be happening this silly virtual reality helmets. </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about Voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - you is certainly not the solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it would not always inform all others about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Any kind of interaction with computers is actually good, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, instead of sprawling gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet, which registered the movements of muscles and bones. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively high, however, theoretically could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But as a whole, however, the future is mixed management types, such as language and gesture. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How it? </seg>
<seg id="800"> We would like to ask, for example, you can in this mineral-rich? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and point it at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can make at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that we need to be working in the near future, especially in the development of new sensor types, enabling it to capture reactions from people in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="807"> For instance, laser sensors can be, as they offer a good resolution in the deep, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What claims based on your work with the Xbox gamescom sensors on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, a speed of 1000 fps with 8 Megapixels are not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the technology itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It must be taken into account not only along the dissolution of the X-, y-, but also along the Z-axis. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of frames per second is also important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps especially for gestures are too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 milliseconds, which are closer to the modern commercial sensors on the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much that affects the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I needed for my work as a device to control only without contact with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Müsste will not increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - gamescom is currently working with three &quot;cameras, and one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the object depth. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could possibly solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> A flexible, gamescom-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations would be nice to see how that helps us in a position of three-dimensional investigation. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I remember correctly, in contrast to Google&apos;s glasses, Microsoft is not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, in view of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course it is not pleasant to go over to keep a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: The neatest solution would be a &quot;temporary&quot; enhanced reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is its strength and is a personal gadget (private) can only see you, but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevented that you can work together with others on virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - positions us for a moment, that not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal accessible in the air is the manipulation of virtual holograms. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: There is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers will be your group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I have often said that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as a rather unusual projection document. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure perfectly true. </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is also technologies that are actually designed to give something tangible to the &quot;pictures&quot; in the air, for example, produces the interference directed by some ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as these fallen someone over the knuckles. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the wrist bands, the acts on his fingers in the nerve endings, this is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Do you tried to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> If there is something to think that it should feel what it felt? </seg>
<seg id="843"> That is a good idea, as we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a man who is physically located in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we are working on treadmills with concepts (other than in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain can be only moderately rich years through lists, and a lot of work ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This makes the work for a researcher in the field of virtual reality so attractive: On many issues, we are just at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Personal taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt is continuing the &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; project, which is dedicated to urban residents, who form the vanguard of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the select list landed already high-level representatives of the Petersburg scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The extravagant artist Kirill Miller is the new Rosbalt held. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red, the times were the Russian Museum, once the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social and philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersberg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man by his presence on the streets of the city and all thanks to his fellow citizens smile and ensures good mood among them. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently he snapped up a barrel organ and became St. Petersburg summertime because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of its artistic life, his philosophy and his image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you usually in red and not for example in turquoise or yellow in the city on the road? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the look and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society is red. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the company raises everything differs slightly from the gray norm, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But through my provocation with the people I want to get involved. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Any of my past provocations was an invitation to talks. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When you knew that you have to be painting? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition in the Cultural Palace main, were issued in my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that I have to go this way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then came the old-time, but not officially recognized painter was at an end, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friendly with the new generation of painters, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; it was &quot;Pushkinskaya 10,&quot; and then was first closure. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I prefers to theater, fashion and music, really at all, except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all that is united in your kind clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture where artists should assemble the best creators. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme until the renovations, the house of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Tequilajazzz, N.O.M., and I also remember how string with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; visited it. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Simple string and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore tight shirts and trendy composer Igor Wdowin today was one of them. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, it was &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the age of &quot;Halli Galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it was his great career, but he learned the basics for us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Even the gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the &quot;Griboedov&quot; club have their origin in the Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, there was a poll, when it came to the award &quot;personalities of our city&quot; in the press. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artist of the year,&quot; and I was reached at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in the new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work have a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and sharpness of thought. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibition with the theme &quot;The Russian museum as a&quot; clown. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier I was socially, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world, by requiring that everyone has to disguise completely. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now respects everyone on the clothes and is based on the exterior and not at the heart of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should do not provide a person but should spit him in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception disappears through the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently we saw you in the role of urban-organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> If not me, then who? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Can commercial art also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before the other large groups formed the people: The Bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes it. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you have to consider if you&apos;ll like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Every cult star now has about 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - At the appearances of Stas Michailow come as several thousand. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - To abandoned women get him where the sexual-social sphere plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Around 300 people and not 10 thousand for cultural reasons, so there is less money, management, and everything is based. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I did not destroy supporters, and the most important thing is that they do not cheat and what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have painted these pictures that a collector even hung in the works with a number of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images that usually come only at the end of a career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It means intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> They say: Servants of culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the real tsars it was different, because the Czar may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be barred because it requires more high-level experts to evaluate the former right and make their way free. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now counts only the own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they say in all honesty that they will not accept any contemporary art and a painter, so we have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is St. Petersburg for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg - is not the European capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a corresponding breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Art can grow hard on the stones. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writer than readers, and that is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art needs to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or killer asteroid collision. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with Erdbewohnern aboard ship on the search for a replacement. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save the human race, the important question is how we can breed in the weightlessness or on the spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> Many choices do not exist in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planets that we could live at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;namely Mars and Venus,&quot; Vladimir Surdin says the scientific staff of the Sternberg astronomical Institute. </seg>
<seg id="940"> While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, however, has a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would only be in high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The question of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first in terms of the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century before that have already been carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit differed not in the least by the alien species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The breeding of insects, followed closely by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how weightlessness affects the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the trouble begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicken must find its footing; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without solid ground on the chicks beat wild. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later stumpften fully from the instincts of a newborn. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks do not respond to light and sounds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> They just died four days later. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;twice we left chicks hatch and keeps the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew stuck to the failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, it will be located on the &quot;Bion&quot; Biosatelliten only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was found nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing space rats got offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproductive directly in space, we have not solved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals that are being ripped from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals could be the man as a matter of principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is capable to abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was for Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most important possessions that humanity has is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The gull flew away, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: It is about the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> After this flight, they can bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Finally nobody answered the question,&quot; said veteran guard Tang Watschnadse space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 came the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the space vehicle Nighthawks, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, it remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very few cosmonaut with which, after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,&quot; concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet the human race needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and create artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The cosmonaut routine win here in a state of flux for the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults water perceive as pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but babies have water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small store Ichtyander testimony from that life in the country rose to the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can more easily get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, that is logical, because from birth until the first swimming take just two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget something,&quot; says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While the weightlessness for a newborn child is so much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of weightlessness the pelvic and abdominal muscles is extremely fast back and thus also takes the ability to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we treat the birth of a senior aid. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber in order to squeeze the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the Erdanziehung feel, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child cannot be set as an adult for training in a pressure suit in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment that we make together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we will get a disability, a perfect unangepassten people to the world,&quot; says the director of the Bioethics Commission ran, Igor Pestow, ahead of the Institute for medical and biological problems. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in the universe is just a theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, it will be a reality, when the people in their space ships leave on a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ chief: Control of the black-system failed because of a fault of politics </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has good monitoring bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls back in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is not perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is not the case with us,&quot; commented in my view of the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> On a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German investigators. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As a bad practice, he brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called &quot;black-system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers would not bother with controls - is the system that is now banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have valid, and if something is illegal, it cannot simply be the chairman of the government, and impede the Kontrollamt, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law in his work,&quot; kala Festival. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the supervisory committee of the Chamber of Deputies spoke about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries were compared in terms of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What were there in concrete terms? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel examination with which we started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is a matter that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not yet complete, we could see very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more &quot;strict and perfect,&quot; but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. It must also deal with the proper application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you be a help to the project? What emerges from this project for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control could help us to stop us constantly perfecting the laws and to seek the reduction and balancing of thresholds if this seems not very positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price to acquire) and exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But orders for the lowering of thresholds does not guarantee that we achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps it is also the case that the system in this way, we only &quot;with&quot; excessive paperwork burden, and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit Office NKÚ similarly structured like us and also has a college that will be formed only slightly different in principle, however, both authorities are similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are comparable to a certain extent, where Germany, however, is a state, which means that they are also in the various states of auditors, in it, the German system is different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control federal funding, which is in line with our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds to be managed by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the country of auditors there. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards the German legislation, is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would compare this without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless Germany in some ways is often described as a model, and we certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> The auditors is perhaps because there are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This is not, but as I said: I may not particularly like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is worth noting that those countries which are a model for us, too, is also struggling with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have nothing of cooperation with our authority, is it not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the Czech legislation, already feel the importance the revision of the procurement law for your authority had any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this novel is only a short time in power, they will not yet made in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Count here with some delay because our controls take place later. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Minimum impact so far more in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - examined and analyzed the changes of course, as the thresholds will change the conditions for certain types of calls have been modified. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You see the passage of this bill rather positive, or will the system burdened with additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It can occur at the problem, however, that the rules are &quot;strict&quot; and can no longer be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) so that any breach of the procurement law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it reasonable to make the bill even tougher? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, not punish those who have committed an error that has no impact on the real decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is only the bureaucracy under greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We first tell which way is not effective. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers do not have control of the so-called black-system &quot;would be something, what exactly does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The black-system is now allowed or banned? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A bill must have valid, and if something is illegal, it cannot simply be the chairman of the government, and hinder its activities in the Kontrollamt, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &apos;We change the law and allow the matter, &quot;but he cannot say that we act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The allocation law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions, and that is also true for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also a tragedy if, with the best bid, the offeror will be excluded solely because of procedural mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets there sporadically Eisglätte, but mostly they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic, there is some snow and Eisglätte. </seg>

<seg id="1105"> The blocking the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of branches, which were pushed from the snow load up on the road. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Our concerts on Šimon Ornest: Do we want to gain positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that the doomsday will take place in less than a month? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those emergency messages that we humans like pounce. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The tap tap make more fun of them and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the doomsday. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you also realize a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21, at 11: 10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, that is, on December 20, will be held from 21: 00 p.m. at three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, in a time zone, about 12 hours ahead, the Mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> This idea comes from whom? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Then we have the idea developed jointly with our designer Honza Augusta, originally think of me. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> We do not collect enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, but we would also consider together with the public in what state we pass this world for our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of T-shirts, shoes, bags and key supporters against the doomsday, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The tap tap also has the so-called anthem, together with other performers included with the title &quot;Armageddon&quot; falls against the doomsday. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. They will also play at benefit concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the end, provided that all is fine and the doomsday is not taking place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuit by Czech television broadcast live. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text Xindl X also sings the anthem by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the clip, with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come to the cooperation with both? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other people of the Czech culture scene that this implies that we realize many charity events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try to incorporate these people hard in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most interested in working with us and enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose does the proceeds benefit concerts against the doomsday? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo that we work together with the association tap the Jedlička Institute for six years before. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly maintained by teachers who help them at different activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In connection with the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building, in which we have with this project should move in. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Each concert occur several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What criteria do you picked them? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Eye, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else can be found on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar &quot;big events&quot; are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are ever in the United States, would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Its overseas plans are not just small, you are so far have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> However, the tap tap is a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it first seems. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold, and we must, of course, many instruments suitcases and other baggage mitschleppen... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that sometimes I have surprised some. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> By travelling abroad you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, how it treats people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its early days. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone is underway in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not even there it goes without saying that a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator Newport. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are clubs trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things that we are behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But this is still noted that an improvement in the situation depends on the efforts of the parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities can use self-employed in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is just not customary for a larger group of disabled people there is we are actively involved in the public arena with the band The tap tap the West a bit ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect among the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when come from our ranks of prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only cases of strong personalities will in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Tap tap is currently very popular if we take a couple of years back: What did you motivated in 1998 to form a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I started as a manager at Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested to deal with something hard. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am musicians and young whites, among others, play, I founded a music-AG along with a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known, but only in the last few years, are we not? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to advertise active for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We become aware that if you are doing something and this is not visible to the outside world, its own performance does not exist in a sense. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good editors, high-quality machines, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Was it your goal to bring it with The tap tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can deal with things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business today often copies of the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical in its way as anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would regret it. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who can develop and live a normal life, if they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities achieve something, this is a step forward, not only for themselves, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strong leader, as do many people hear? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to do something well, many things in one should not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But it seems perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic notions, and if they see that they have twice a week trial, must complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then transfer the enthusiasm among many quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> That is how it works everywhere, in every band that work seriously and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, The tap tap has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were present from the very beginning, since 1998. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. The people come and go. We cannot prevent that. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome to us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Place Thursday, the day before the predicted doomsday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, the 20-member, Poland at a ministerial meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency, ESA this space agency, Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994, and participated in several in the following years, close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Poland&apos;s journey into space began but much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before World War II engaged Polish cosmos impressed with the space, but they are not always cast in understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought presented &quot;entrance to Outer Space Exploration&quot; for his pioneering work. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Gadomski Jan had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to Outer Space Exploration&quot; the Prix donated by André Louis Hirsch and Robert Esnault-Pelterie rep deer. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Gadomski Jan (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in national magazines and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was hailed by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already an inoperative railroad was built in Poland in 1925, was scheduled for a rocket propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remain unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or should be used to slow the trolley. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The details come exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rockets and bullets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the traditional documents that research had penetrated to the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research was then interrupted, however, by the invasion of the German army. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the trade press the draft by Ing. Rohoziński photoelectric hunt rocket on, and the following year was the work of &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Krzywoblocky-Leliwa lotnicza&quot; of the author. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war were all projects for the military use of missile technology scientific advice from the Temporary Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, however, after two years of work, his work was finished by the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (ANRO received Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this company is dedicated to the four major items of space in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in 1954. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was clear that the future would have the exploration of space. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since its inception in 1956 sought the Polish aerospace company PTA in order to join the International Federation for space travel, founded in 1951 and the PTA has actually been ordinary member in the autumn of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This post he had held until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 participated the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was made on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Started in 1959 and later became an improved version, the RM-1A, built in the two-stage rocket with flight tests the Bledowska Desert RM 2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another development stage should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM 34 should be used for the observation of high winds and reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, was set to the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The first rocket of the type RM successor was the meteor-1-Rakete developed from 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> From this rocket were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) to distinguish themselves from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1B about 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C about 0.62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude was 37 km at all three types. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 miles. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> The versions were then built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Poland&apos;s joining the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research, followed two years later the establishment of a National Committee on the COSPAR) in 1960. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos inter-program with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miro Law Hermaszewski after the Czech cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the past week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> That decision provoked a lively discussion among the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages), there will be price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturer is trying to insist by importing cheaper goods in economic competition in the competition &quot;undercut&quot; in order to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In a large-scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap there, or to give up their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital needs no social responsibility and therefore bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, rising government spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace this society of economic and social damage caused by them. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so precise statistics are unnecessary at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in the individual economies to artificially lower the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments will deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly true in modifications of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of workers. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The results are growing poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Germany has been around for a number of years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of victims is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which such a low wage workers maintain that the state must increase their income by subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of auxiliary staff working in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all the EU&apos;s southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and we hope that some private investment capital is flowing into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here is the question of where this capital comes from nature? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only moves of poverty from one country to another, or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not involved with capital of its own economy, and that a planned economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital insisted blinkered in its position that the state should not interfere lenkend in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then you have to ask, however, if not the private capital of the policy and that affects the entire state in our own selfish sense or even draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, reciprocal privileges, a law in which virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> The situation is such that a State Department without private finances closely interdependent with the industry in Germany right companies charged with drawing up draft legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The violence is no longer from the people of how to declare the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Apparently caught the liberal democracies are currently in a situation as it quickly Appian describes in his book on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius&apos;: &quot;The state has long understood the collapse, and the offices were occupied by force. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes, through illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The corruption proliferated already bought votes with abandon, and the people went to the polls... &quot;&quot; people with character is not applied for positions, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline. &quot;&quot; You really started to talk about it that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen &quot;Appian thought is to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy on a permanent basis by the autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is based in today&apos;s society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of own benefit without having to pay interest on the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> By its very nature, the private capital is not able to recognize and enforce the benefit for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Today, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not strive for deeper reforms in the least. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Seen from the current situation, the demise of the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as some pause, in the next round is already apparent. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that today&apos;s elites in the future is particularly disastrous loss witnessed by hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance face. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on charitable work here is no solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of European and global economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Therefore, this trend is due to system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the people on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;... that nothing comes from violence, or ever could emerge&quot; Fragile, &quot;Sting sings in the song, whose main chorus verse reads... so that we don&apos;t forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When my sons wanted no wars, there would be no,&quot; says the dying existed Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they support the Palestinians as terrorists; others argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the Palestinians, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who is guilty and whoever victims in these recurrent waves of killing; in the end, today&apos;s residents of Israel, including the self-management areas have been born in the current political situation and have not even seen the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It is me about the readers to open a look behind the scenes, the look, whom the voltage 95 years (counting the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small patches of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people greatly influenced the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether there really were always these figures themselves, given their moves autonomously, or whether someone behind her throne was directed at a vorbestimmtes goal of their actions. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to admit that we live in a time where the wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals in the world, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under this astronomical rich families is a particular, which could be described as the head of the kraken (I don&apos;t know if anyone else stands above them, I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection with criminal acts of its name, stood in the background is the consolidation of power, the proliferation of their assets or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all banks in the world, and to the countries where they are not involved in the central banks to wage wars or equip themselves to this (7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, it was five countries, before the attack on Afghanistan after the ouster Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has accused the central bank of the Russian government in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with his life. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild&apos;s Bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, was assassinated in 1865 in a theater and publish their own (read: State) notes. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite of the Rothschilds led by Albert PIK, a Masonic in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars of the 33rd and highest level of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states of Europe, by the second war should be broken in Britain&apos;s colonial rule, and the third war aims to reduce the global population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comfort and luxury and would not create as many resources), a universal religion (of ecumenism is nothing more than the prior) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method, in which the group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer for a solution (from Chao - is the order from the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see foundation of the Fed to prevent crises like the recurrence of them triggered in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After they had succeeded Ferdinand in Sarajevo by the assassination of the Hapsburg heir to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the war was Czarist Russia no longer needed), then followed the dissolution of the Central European power of Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to spark World War II easier, the bankers could create a latent conflict by politics, by Germany occupied with huge war reparations; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to cheer the Germans but a strong enough leader, named for the culprits and simple solutions offered Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the multiethnic state with a strong German minority that should play the role of a fifth column and also took to ignite the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the nineteenth century initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the Rothschilds sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area Judea with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There have been terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether the chain of Hitler massively, in which he had initially thought the international bankers, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, as well as the war reparations against Germany, the ground has been prepared for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people will be similar to the victims of the Second World War in the battle front line, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (think about how sharply divide the people of supporters and opponents of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the victim and who is the culprit in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, which causes wrong, just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> One must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel as well as us, the people, only their own candidates for election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fragile fascism, the international bankers loyal dutiful politician who does everything for it to ignite a war with Iran, in the face of Iran&apos;s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly spread to a global conflict, and with it because of Iran&apos;s control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world&apos;s oil supplies run could come to a deterioration of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the words of David Rockefeller as the light of 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to subject the essence of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that the kids and the adults, the rich and the poor, the open and the servants all give themselves a malt oaks on their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt oak, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is a wisdom, anyone who has reason to put the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-sixty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: If the worst is that Hollywood&apos;s call </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American government, there was no good way out of this situation, they could not afford to jettison the Shah, because it would have damaged the trust of its allies in other countries on a massive scale. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time it was not able to secure the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> There was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made it even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages called a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&apos;s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small part of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the embassy was six embassy staff to flee. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to an extravagant story covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Staff who allegedly visited a science-fiction film locations in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combining the genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan developed by experts on &quot;Exfiltration,&quot; Tony Mendez, was also required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, at the same time, a so-called &quot;Caper Movie,&quot; which is the story of a successful job (such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This will change the mood levels - the documentary scenes from Tehran on one side (in the title sequence in the movie iconic contemporary photographs shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose parts come from Hollywood, which is ironic and easy to exaggerate. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at a conference table, in the office corridors, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> With this film, Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable start of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a losing actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third film after the thriller No snap (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is first film, who did not play in the director&apos;s native Boston Afflecks. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that this director&apos;s previous films from the standard Hollywood actors. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;played&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when moving somewhere once the story. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck, with his team, with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much plot in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with this, the story is actually not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He works with the little but quite successful, where he helps the reality for some of the time, then what is not always as elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit contrived). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show a lot of action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood employees are very charming, but their characters have earned more space, and that they are far from alone in the film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film is losing traction by something. It is a movie with some interest and it can approve the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Enthusiasm, however, raises difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a still living piece of history and proof of how exaggerated notions of the omniscient and omnipotent secret services, however, are in some way, but is it enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Every year, a poll on the most ridiculous charges, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com exclaims, has this year decided to organise the contest idea from EU workshop &quot;or&quot; most absurd regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;At this idea gave us the recently put forward by the EU&apos;s plan to introduce a women&apos;s quota of 40% in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher who cares about the organization of this survey, compared with the daily Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until then, women enjoyed an advantage because they represent a lower risk for the insurers objective in life insurance. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;More incredible incursions from EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote is then carried out by the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher with. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> One of the controversial EU regulations including the mandatory admixture of bio-ethanol fuel, which is damaging nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively low amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of hen cages, because of this year eggs were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism in 1967, in the past, the prohibition of the use of the term &quot;Butte bus line&quot; or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas have to be 14 inches long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU apparatus is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels, as a rule, are represented by one or more Member States (as attempts at the Czech Republic, for example, also with a veto-threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also behind the highest trading class that bananas in the EU should have no &quot;curve anomaly&quot; and must be at least 14 inches long. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended it on the grounds that they would hinder the fragmented national standards only harmonisiere trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables were softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries with the reminder that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The EU regulation is potentially a candidate for the victory in the poll last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale with the reminder that children under eight years cannot inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU is the leading cause of the suffocation of children in accordance with balloons, citing an American study. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years already using Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious incursions at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Quite absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who occupies an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) must instead say. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association of liberal economists laissez Faire, in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a member country. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU submitted to the maximum volume of food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic on pace for the specified volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine threatened us. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or to provide funding for applications for funding from the idea. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will apply for reimbursement to the EU, &quot;said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (5) in the autumn of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He led in the argument that the grain harvest was very high and the state stores were crowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us under the Palas. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far ahead that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for funding for the communities of the Ministry of regional development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in concrete terms, it is a means for the establishment of aid money should be points to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations are in the Member States may easily become the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts earned about regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, but rather recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A more serious problem, according to these experts, rather than the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member states. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions calls in this country is the fact that, like other members in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic could defend the title &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot; after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), a tradition dating back to the 1800s, had to rename our manufacturers, &quot;Tuzemák&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name may only be used for products made from sugar cane rum, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of diving in the company of famous feta cheese products registered in the EU and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits now of Karlovy Vary, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hop on. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> With an EU trademark can brag because the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer roles. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> &quot;People want me to save the republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur,&quot; Okamura said. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Senator, why is it on the idea to run for the office of the president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I do not want to be president or senator. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything in our country would work without any problems, I would stand anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer be plundered by the Republic for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people are increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to become politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But if I see something that I don&apos;t like, then I try to propose a solution to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I&apos;m already over 40, and to independent and belong to influence things, I have no other option than to run for the office of a senator or the president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have done it and then made off on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> It&apos;s not your constituents back? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that I will take up the fight at the castle after the result of the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have said that I will run for the office of the president, if I am elected senator and refined it. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> For this I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the TV, but turn down anyone who wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This will confuse the freedom to lie with the freedom of speech and the media who want to rob the honor. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was manager of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let&apos;s talk about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The battle for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset statements you have recorded more than 20 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You need to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen, I argued that the guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the quarrelsome politics, if someone comes with a good proposal from the right or the left, this is deliberately rejected, and that keeps the population only on. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party or do I have a much greater potential to win support in all parties represented in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Watch as a man in politics rather right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this right-left-thinking but completely irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right, I want to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support publicly every good solution, even if it comes from the mutual or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> They dislike you, if someone called you populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But this confirm that what you just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you have both a vision and an ideal target. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And do you want to approach this. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by relevant experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament will remain mere buzzwords. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And that does not go far in politics in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that if you talk long enough with people, you will be able to push through the material and criminal liability, for example? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To achieve these goals, to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to bring them on our side. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, there would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to the statute book. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the Angesprochenen would then possibly have to say why they oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality points to abuse can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a virtue of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I would like to say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have only just started with the policy and try to find the support of the majority of my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the situation, and if it doesn&apos;t work then I go back to the private sector in six years. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I can do nothing, and therefore I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have spoken with Jančura Radim, for example, but rejected due to overwork. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I&apos;m not sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls not at all, and those who are left are usually elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are thus only two independents in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and chief men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering the establishment of a party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past of each potential party member, and do not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about financial statements, what would you be? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I value my private assets to approximately 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a property with a value of 25 million, about 10 million for an apartment in Prague, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for a Škodu position, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million and 3.5 million in the bank. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was also a children&apos;s dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in a car, was published to women, and at the same time fight against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> They drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not put your own money. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is hardly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make some debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not a great deal of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senator close budget alone I could not live, so I like my son could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Keep on working as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you will not drive back these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that is not cooperating with the wage level. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have reduced my activities in part. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> So, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want to see me as a Samaritan saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must also live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> In what month income have you used as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As president, I would stop my activities are entirely. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV show that the true adventures are not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the recently established books mountain, 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a technician at the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: &quot;Nevertheless, it is beautiful, the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style libraries, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little visit need special-record holder is sleeping city at the gates of Rotterdam. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest rate education throughout the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to counter this stupid thing, one of a few years ago decided to contribute to general education and the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro seem to be pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures clones. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive has not been particularly good. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so did the city fathers that there was only one way, the statistics must be Mr: A library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas by the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the foolhardy bar charts and producer of funny or often cynical buildings, appeared at the competition-hearing in 2003 and took the matter with the usual composure with five books under the arm and a smile on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still intrigued with his shoulders and looked around helplessly, Esspecially a five kilogram box of dry dates of cheeky Maas his fine jewelry according to the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist founded speech with the words: &quot;Dear municipality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, he, therefore, for the so-called tailor-mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euros is expensive mountain Rwy14. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalization project that also includes garage, supermarket, post and a couple of adjacent living and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books with the second prize was awarded &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is the faceless small town retort that until now no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian and disbelief ugly town hall, behind its white facade, one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory a piece of contemporary architecture richer. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Books Eldorado bubble. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and reading pleasures are opened to within reach of the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The glazed interior is bright and clear, the ceramic clinker soil and elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban setting is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Boys and girls are already looking for a park bench, dog and playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere, books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and is in the middle of a large, dark room, is the most uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic room configuration on its head and put the reading area from the inside to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the book &quot;is shrewdly: In the middle are central offices, internet library, Chess Club, environmental center and home technology. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> The black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panels, sometimes parapet, times 220.000 Dollar is a particular pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel, and smell are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even hardbitten architects and engineers unknown elements of whether offs shake their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work here with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trou Borst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen farm one day came across a suitable waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years is used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic film as root base. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and time-efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for bulky. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the fleece, for the first time in this volume, pressed to four centimetres thick slabs. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, burden-material that smells a little after new cars and sport shoes after a little. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps, we arrived at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of nearly 500 meters long wanderings will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch dry dogfood and eingetopften Ficus trees in the literary cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literary mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe it, but this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology, despite the many windows,&quot; says Trou Borst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Will be heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book mountain is under a glass fall, even on sunny days, the sun appears only briefly into the interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad wood glue binder, which are across the glass facade, serve as a shading and catch a large portion of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The room climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Fully automatic blinds do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde to tailor-mountain soul even as Spijkenisses &quot;long overdue.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> That should be filled once the optical gaps in the library has not yet been fully stocked, currently 70,000 pieces, for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has taken root. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation has some relationship to each inhabitant of this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only for groceries. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> MVRDV managed those king discipline called identity calls the jargon. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> So young and uneducated it may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, this is a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo, &quot;German must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin that balances on a thin diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Then abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza does not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany is also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was finally enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> That is because it is precisely his foreign policy shift away from the policy, which has been managed by the United States, in the direction of German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans find themselves trapped in the middle. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> One expects them to play a more independent role, but that are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they fumble is still approach their roles, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy than specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are different than those of other major powers and, to a certain extent Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful not alienating the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not even want to attach too much weight, it is not entirely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, while it has abstained from important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position in Europe and even in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps it will play Germany so that even some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are some differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> As a result of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably has quite a lot of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government cannot defend this position in public, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as great as they always appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu&apos;s policy course. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Find it difficult in Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side to agree? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> They just do it with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe in the future will play a leading role in Germany, Europe to push for a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, that is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player - Germany wants to play a major role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the lead of Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not yet accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, because every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings are free. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That makes it not easy to the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is the old problem: You don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be sensitive to their neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from the EU to fill this vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they don&apos;t like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an Institute of academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together to investigate the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;brand protection&quot; in China: If Armani and Puma are suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani also is a famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind it lurks a term officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Yet it is protected as long as the actual name donors do not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright infringement in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week a new case landed on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators are already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So, instead of simply Lu-Gucci, Gucci, Prada Prada Kny register. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Stalemate hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010 was the trademark Zegna DF protect Puma, a Chinese company named an art that is also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> There are multistory department stores that sell counterfeit almost exclusively in the big cities. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Stalemate hole cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he is against Chinese companies from the internet to officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; a passenger mark. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> Women who are rich men fish. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It will be bad for business, you have to fight it,&quot; stalemate hole demands. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The process costs of the affected industries and the financial losses are in the millions, particularly in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go to the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years can drag the procedure with uncertain results. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Stalemate hole reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because complained after the long duration of the name had become the &quot;market&quot; reality. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff had bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also involve graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the machinery maker Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker shine master. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese may still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyer Geely was originally a blue and white logo, which reminded on BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion maker Lacoste lost against followers in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing, is that there have been shortages in 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year was one of the &quot;emergency in the workflow returned to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals have decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed one, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Still waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To confront this costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, when CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This means that China and was a record for the 10th time in a row, the list of members worldwide lead, informs the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> That also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Simplified means that any registration costs an average of 160 euros or 1280 yuan. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the group&apos;s fight against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans could reach the imitation of illegal production of automotive parts was unearthed. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But secured the Chinese rights of followers of the Freudenberg brand. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed this as surnames in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler says, the Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical spec-Ties in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The trademarks agency CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich back as well. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two instances, Freudenberg may be right, but the process is fighting against continue to this day. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We must have extreme caution </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;This case is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could hardly put the company archive must have even see a hundred years through old records to prove them. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; of the other party in vain for a settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;Because we see how much it is worth,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Even after Europe zurückzuschwappen threaten the dangers in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> That is, when they grow unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You must be extreme caution,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies tend to be very cautious in dealings with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, should the foreigners &quot;everything that is worth protecting somehow register in China,&quot; as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, this will be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama below deck, one of the other side should pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Help World Aids Day: Noise, singing. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg Imbongi - and in Swaziland are AIDS orphans. </seg>

<seg id="1709"> It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg rehearsing the choir Imbongi a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> About fifty singers come between 23 and 69 years old, of human genetics, until Haussmann. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;om&quot; Obani &quot;is no easy piece, every voice choir has a different text and that even in a foreign language, Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland. </seg>

<seg id="1713"> There are about 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, estimates that UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on Aids Bekämfung. </seg>

<seg id="1715"> Living in Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village, the association has found Voices for Africa Friend in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend secondary school. </seg>

<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the child education money, school uniforms and a hot meal each day in the Gogo-Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or even Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The Bantu language fluently speak can sing, but nobody in this room. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly ten years, the choir songs in this strange soft language and brings them from time to time and then back to where they originally come from, in the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because air line from Heidelberg, 8 733 kilometers to the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir. </seg>

<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have no more parents because they impose the hi virus. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni shows the kids that all Swaziland suffers: High HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male foreskin restrictions that can be reduced by half the risk of contagion will hardly be accepted by the people. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland, the immunodeficiency virus in terms of dying with mid-30 is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, discovered the choir of the village, in particular, saw the Imbongis many children at all, but simply on the streets, which not only lacked parental responsibility: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a school in a poor country, it is certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the beginning there was the personal commitment of individuals for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day. </seg>

<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> STI are frequent viral hepatitis or Talis salacious Humane Pappilomaviren, HIV, herpes. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Felt itch and lice are among the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the most vulnerable groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper come especially among men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> When the dan Candidose (mushroom), Humane and Tripper Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia infections are heterosexual adults. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively small, however, accounts for about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections among young people are far more often than other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> After three quarters of all infections affect European surveys young people aged between 15 and 25. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here are also frequent Humane Pappilomaviren among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections developed? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all the reporting obligations are sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections more than doubled in 1697 disease in 2001 at 3698 diseases from the Robert Koch Institute in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new infections of HIV-goes back since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> The symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, prayed with abdominal pain and blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infection and narrow-body contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> So experts recommend especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Diagnosed early most STI cured and late consequences can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir throughout Germany ersingt comes a lot together. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;Overall, we have already sent about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village itself manages Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive strong woman, the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also cares about the orphans are well under at one of the grandmothers around. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, how on Zulu calls the old women, are the mainstays of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have received up to 14 orphans in itself to give them a roof over your head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day on time to the school. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Nobody has to come to the protection House Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as the two cooks cook every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has also launched a sewing school, organized jointly with the American health organization PSI and built two chicken houses that make many in the village have an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> That cannot be taken for granted, for obvious as the disease across the country is dead, they prefer to remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Really strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> King Mswati III, the last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned lifestyle that the hi virus has spread so quickly in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms are on every corner, Annette Lennartz says, &quot;but the rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different - flesh-to-flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi choir every two or three years together with the South African and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, black self-esteem and confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent remaining from the days of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of albacore, sing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings joy and mood, but has also been some fierce border soldiers a few tears off defies. </seg>

<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as is evident from three studies published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region are constantly lying in the shadow of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 feet thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is probably came from comets or asteroids possibly taken on the Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one put the discovery of ice but associated with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our insights into space: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star watching a year later. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were increasing - and the insights they deliver deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Here in the picture, the mirror, had an average of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It will look into space, just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner workings of the capital of Gran Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The design disadvantage: The telescope is hanging in his elevation angle - and this limited in his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at high angles. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His specialty: The high light collective strength. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite comparatively low levels in diameter, this is access to the world&apos;s largest mirror telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) told researchers that space for alien signals. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>

<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors the telescope can shall include the medium-range. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Also on the Chilean ESO observatory is planned for the European extremely Large Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is expected to include a whopping 42 meters - and put together from just under 1000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> With photos, but is expected until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna KEA, the Hawaiian volcano as the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They offer two mirrors with an average of 10 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna KEA observatory that looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF alongside them. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Also on Mauna KEA is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror-average of 30 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> It is here to see an illustration. </seg>

<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, extrasolar planets in the Kepler space telescope - especially for those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that were identified 1,235 planet candidates since the start of the mission. </seg>

<seg id="1871"> Scientists estimate that the Mercury ice at the South Pole also exists. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there are no reliable data, as the messenger is far closer at the North Pole revolves around the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades, radar measurements suggest that there is ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> By the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous with Eurovision Song Festival in May, and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documents from the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Fathered a child at the age of 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But controversial star of the museum has become the shepherd Şirali Müslümov of 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is a birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And in the face of the oldest documented people was 122 years old appears Müslümovs age but highly dubious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;in 1805, he was born here in the region, he died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man had been married three times and should have had 23 children at the age of 136 years he had fathered a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has Şirali Müslümov so charged in his age for a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But also the age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Rembrandt Scholz, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;live in Sardinia too many very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation was, however, no scientific proof were needed on the age, especially as people stand Register. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day means cup melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach an uncritical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why are so many here in the South-aged? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explained that with the specific genes Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But for all the calories of food the Talyschen is to be as healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view is not plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? Lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With her 97 years for these latitudes, it is still relatively young. </seg>

<seg id="1926"> All my life I have not once bought groceries at the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the period after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> By 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham later took the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no need of Azerbaijan&apos;s Old. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), gets Mirzayeva per month as a pension, by local standards, an amount that you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, has also been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: &quot;The old enjoy respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in the extended family will be loved and cared for and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;right&quot; is missing in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution based on Sharia law is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president not saved with pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And it is my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all the people, in particular, as well as the Liberals, the Christian Copts, enlightened Muslim and secular fuels. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> For all of them have hopelessly divided in a confused opposition are afraid. </seg>

<seg id="1948"> He said that Mohamed Morsi almost entschuldigend temporarily curtail the powers of the Constitutional Court, and expanded his powers, &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary should be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-member Constituent Assembly as a nightly, 15-hour Parforceritt were rushed through, some worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the case law based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and is subject to interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> It will be held at least a newly guided article near: In all issues relating to Sharia should consult the Al-Azhar University, the country&apos;s main Islamic institution with great power throughout the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It is not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would result in de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: Civil military jurisdiction should further maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These dishes served during Mubarak&apos;s rule on the suppression of opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state should also, as stated in the draft, &quot;&quot; protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> That is legally formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In other words, this means nothing other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> No article, by the way, explicitly prescribes equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> It prohibits another to insult or slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> What is an insult and how it should be punished, though, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> The phrase &quot;insulting people&quot; should be banned is equally dubious. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is there a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Morsi&apos;s signature before and after his words &quot;very soon&quot; the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition has formed for weeks against the overwhelming power of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square and vowed to bring down the charter before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter leaning presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution &quot;belong to the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> He accused Morsi&apos;s supporters want to lead a &quot;coup against democracy&quot; via text messaging service Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If the referendum he proclaims, we will go to his palace and oust him,&quot; said the opposition Jasser said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not punished,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that the referendum would not be trying to monitor, making it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to counter-demonstration, cautiously but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Bank in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi attended and cried: &quot;The people demand the application of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded by Morsi: &quot;do the country!&quot; and protested: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have civil war provoked similar conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Morsi&apos;s supporters apparently did not risk that. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both proponents and opponents of the draft constitution would have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The draft for a majority of the Islamists is considered safe. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The word &apos;rights is not even before&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process should have gone until February and involve all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because he would share their beliefs, but because for him, and human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution,&quot; he complained in the interview with AFP. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi&apos;s expansion in all three powers in the state, the lawyer would resign. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Bringing to strengthen civil society, the president put them de facto aside,&quot; laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> But a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, the fight the ideological direction along the Nile viewed with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>

<seg id="2005"> One place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> And leave it there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Just about one of the great delights of Norway, one must imagine the nose section of the Rakfisk smell. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours drive from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply will not disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented in water up to a year, depending on how one&apos;s stinky fish would like. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When the darkness comes on the country and the weather gets colder in Norway, Norwegian flock to Fagernes in a celebration here, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass aquavit,&quot; says Howard Halvarsen that actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called &quot;Rakfisk-General&quot; also organized the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us eat small fish cubes and business people to pass large quantities of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Mansche people like the aquavit over the Rakfisk,&quot; says Howard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The spirit can displace the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I eat a few bites. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it avoids to bring the Rakfisk near the nose, he is not bad - such as sushi, which has quite a long bus behind it. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish in the autumn has been soaked in salt water barrels airtight. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and eaten, undoubtedly with steamed through alcohol senses. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and migrated mainly in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who have not long ago was far richer than Norway, flows of immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly fragrant part of Norwegian history. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But is it expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often in the world press, and most people seem not to care. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here are still hates it, Anders Breivik by its proper name - the racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 men, women and children last year. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it applies only to the &quot;incident&quot; on July 22. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in a peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Norway&apos;s prime responsibility for the current wealth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien growth since the early 1970&apos;s of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why it is so good for us,&quot; says Anna, our waitress round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are a prudent, as the saying goes, people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Her English is spotless like that of most people here. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not quite a show-off, &quot;we may not emerge. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway is very cautiously dealt with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As in the years before the Great Depression threw money around with all that they had never gave Norway its purse firmly closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And of course Rakfisk eating,&quot; adds them with easy laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow and put me on a different court at Rakfisk - I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> As a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat told me. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But the evening is back on the menu of the Stinkefisch. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I logiere, is one of several venues to organise a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell sense - fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live TV broadcast to a show with fly clad master, which is surrounded by Rakfisk plates. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What score you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here are our points, Howard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> They are sharing and laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his inauguration, he analyzed the BBC&apos;s Will Grant challenges and the mixed feelings of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently, the traffic is especially bad in Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but a ring of steel was built on Monday, several important routes on the streets and in the capital absperrt ensures chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidents of binding and take over the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon&apos;s Mexico can prove economically as well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the past six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence,&quot; Pena Nieto said earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, Pena Nieto act as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote village of Valle del Bravo reminds you like for example to him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The holiday village residents attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In order to reach the city, you can go on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> His name with plaques hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect him real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel LA Hernandez, who works as a Member of Congress for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, as regards the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Congressman LA admits that the party after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos makes great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The allegations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, rejects it. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, above all, he is someone who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo in Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The town lies hidden under motorway bridges and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> At the beginning of this year has enabled the military to fight drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a corner fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Pena Nietos critics believe that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure at least. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, however, his government have closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete, typical of the rundown district, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of their dead daughter Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Her family believes, however, that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if her body had been washed,&quot; Senora Buendia recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigid corpses had already deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, looks back on us from the wall a picture of Mariana. It is appropriate in a cross that bears a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But exactly this, so the family, have denied it until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want you to simply accept their verdict and mouths. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But this is not possible if there were so many flaws and failures,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto on Saturday will tie the president, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised, during his term, particularly to attend to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president he is the way he was as governor,&quot; said PRI Congressman LA in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The prosecution claimed that Bradley Manning was not complaining about mistreatment </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The public prosecutor against Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The hearing will deal with Mannings time in the military prison in Virginia, quan tico </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense is seeking a dismissal of the indictment due to harsh prison conditions on </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The operas of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecution has sought to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in American history, missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> When cross-examined Mannings Erich Monaco during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents had made weekly visits to the prison officials during nine months of prison time in Virginia, quan tico Mannings, had no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The day before the cross interrogation that was held as a result of a request from the defense for the rejection of the indictment, Manning had been punished enough by the harsh prison time, Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning had filled in the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the tico quan-military prison where he had increased from July 2010 to April 2011 under detention in Essen. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> As Fine interviewed him on Friday on the forms, gave Manning to that he had judged the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by the establishment as &quot;very professional&quot; as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, so thin, contained no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials had questioned Manning directly on his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, the officials have discussed this with him and given to deal with them, but they have not been logged. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (concerns),&quot; No problem, &quot;debriefing on, and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all,&quot; as Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why, when he met with a committee in January 2011, he is not about his treatment of values that should investigate the suicide thought he mentioned a few months earlier on a form. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied, his intention to leave during this meeting, it was downgrading its observer status to &quot;prevention of injury&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that it had given him this restrictive status, which is one level below the suicide risk, to his and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to get rid of the observer status on the prevention of injury and convince people that I was doing well (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life for me,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to the prison in July 2010 in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Marine base quan tico in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> In Kuwait, he considered the suicide and was due to the heat to become unconscious, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not to be able to know what&apos;s happening to him, or in the outside world, had been wearing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell together at Camp Arafjon, on the cage,&quot; said Manning Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was moved to quan tico, said Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he was trying to stay on the move, because the day had been forbidden to sleep or even added. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He always have to sleep with light, which moved into his cell from the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If he had turned up at night and guards could no longer see his face, you have to wake him up so that he can turn back the clock. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the Mannings treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday asked the judge Manning also to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, so he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in quan tico and must be at a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover up with a blanket during the counting. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> In the survey on Friday gave Manning in that he had concluded his watch from a command that he should drop the ceiling, with which he might cover themselves, but he admitted that he had asked no one. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning testified that during the previous night, he was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an official that he poses no danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning told the officials that he would have the federal government can use his underwear or his flip-flops to injure themselves, but this is not done. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> On this night, Manning aus said, had been removed from his cell to his underwear, flip-flops and glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce his prison experiences at least take into account and his detention measure, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has indicated that Manning is guilty of lesser crimes committed while other charges, which are seen as too extreme, are to be contested. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend by the prosecutor is expected to justify the detention. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all prisoners under the highest safeguards in quan tico Deutsche. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> He is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control than me in perplexity spread. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: One for &quot;Wochos (Mexicans), another for&quot; Extranjeros &quot;(&quot; Aliens &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California and was called &quot;Mexicans&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic symbol - just as in Boston, my friends call &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; my friends in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided on &quot;Mexican-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in my grandfather&apos;s home, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, at least well enough to claim me in an interview that language at both ends. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not going on. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment after this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> All those issues were on the agenda, which is expected to meet the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy and is one reason that Mexicans today is just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trade bloc after a model of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun that forced them to leave more than half of their territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans to think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event will not be overlooked. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Once that is a U.S. government official even mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, hears complaints about how the American press the sovereignty of its neighbour, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Zuma&apos;s go on the war path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Yet the greatest challenge lies in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that, at a point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or parents immigrated to the north and was commanded part - no chance in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases was that person a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may now live the American dream, have received good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Clearly, this is the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> We are also aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, they were not left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not see caught behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and object to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are, and Mexican Americans take them so badly. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While she is a US citizen, they see themselves as part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling of belonging to neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we will be seen as an American. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I should learn during my visit, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some parts of the bourgeoisie education and Mexican leaders want to resume their connections to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to represent their interests in the United States, Mexican Americans use as a temporary &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great is a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injured feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And in the face of unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you alone, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge as their family members were treated fairly recently. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican,&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can there be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual blame countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict changes the Middle East around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally find the end of it. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is neither lost nor gained </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems anything but appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the truce agreed on 21 November continues, this week&apos;s struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have the Israelis pushed back, although his group even large losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip and killed several Hamas leaders in one of the most desperate and densely populated corners of the planet will be locked up, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah wins. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leader could conclude that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas is rich and powerful friends can draw on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power, a revival, which once regarded as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken the side of Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels could be an increasing number of Misti scissors before Stürzung Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the country is by far the strongest and most important Arab inhabitants, especially on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, Hamas verschwägert and their leaders with the Brotherhood is more dependent on people&apos;s views. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be Hamas as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, have an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas is no more danger. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed and the Israeli missile defence system, &quot;Iron Dome,&quot; has to prove its worth. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel can sleep quietly. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Keep in diplomatic terms the United States steadfastly stuck to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has been well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the Sperranlagen run into the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and that they will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared contrary to international law, but continued to expand. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman, allied with a group of RISC Herengracht still fighting. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this nanny behind cunning Palestinians and left to their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they really had control of the West Bank, were it not just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip fire rockets? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, if you dare to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring may make them a line through the bill. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defence budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> For the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama set to achieve a cease-fire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis also should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv this week exploded. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression undermines the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Over the years, bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic tribute. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a push from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is that, by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and will be represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The small for the near future hope is that the cease-fire gives more power to enforce this solution to outsiders. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now work with Turkey and Qatar is better positioned than ever before, and stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange and a common area of Jerusalem, to convince. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama also needs to do its share to persuade Israel to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he missed the idea of its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were equally unwilling to participate in it. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a regrettable, myopic perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Single cigarette packaging for Australian laws come into force </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and infected body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first single cigarettes and tobacco packaging laws came into force in Australia. Brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, prolific lid, which also printed with graphic images that show diseased body parts and babies and children infected by cigarette smoke. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the various health warnings and images is the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in small identical letters from next Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This leads Australia the world&apos;s most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian government wants young people smoking by the glamorous image of smoking is eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> 26 with the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, with 99% match likely will also start after that. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can already see young age in children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image,&quot; said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a marginal impact on the profits of the multinationals, consider other countries have already taken similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It was claimed that the laws would favor the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater amounts of such products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra hectares of best like Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids on the cover of unbearable packaging has grown enormously, since the companies of British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Britain&apos;s, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on the Australian Supreme Court in its ruling that the law failed. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Best like Zico, up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and waiting for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good deal. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the rub lies in the popularity of social media at exactly the group aimed at the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, they may not act as sports sponsors and forced most traders interpret cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the advertising changed on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and pages, but has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Anyone who sells tobacco and has left only a small area, in order to promote its products, comes around the Internet does not,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in reports of experience to brands that have been written by &quot;ordinary people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask the question: Is this just a private person who so enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes finds that it even begins a video - or has a marketing agency to do? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focus instead on marketing to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions, though none of the countries has increased trade with Australia in the World Trade Organisation. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government has held talks with other countries to consider similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to give photographic warnings in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Meanwhile, they extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The pictures do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;It is simply a hole and put the box away,&quot; says Victor El Hage in the purchase of a cigarette packet, printed on a photo with a mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operators of the tobacco trade &quot;King of the pack&quot; in the heart of Sydney, says the single packaging have hampered the filling its shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;In the past, I needed an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,&quot; Yu said. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government ought to ban cigarettes simply completely - then we said okay, that&apos;s it, we make dense,&quot; adds he visibly upset. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world of constant elektrisierten, it is nice to be bored at times </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane unexpectedly failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight that is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping is available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academic and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> When it comes to them, it is okay for us, and our children, to be bored at times. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us today almost constant stare at a screen or another, we will no longer serve the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should therefore welcome with open arms the boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> This brings me back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;Boredom: A lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) does not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom has a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada is the problem that has been discussed and boredom defined in many ways. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of the presentation of the idea in a focus group of about 100 people and research literature Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience, &quot;to be able to do a satisfactory job, this is not&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from apathy, so that the person is not busy, but this would be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no need to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a &quot;disruption of the process of attention, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> You can almost hear it as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood believes that could be related to these two states, bored people see the problem in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves and their surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that is boring to us, even if we just have problems, focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention&quot; - in English: &quot;The idle minds: The definition of boredom in the context of attention,&quot; which appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard this noise. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, wrote to the difficulties of boredom and could find no reason for this. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If, however, you put a dreary activity, &quot;as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor, can distract music and help to feel not bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that can fight Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people remain physically attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Studies have shown that children keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still, &quot;said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will eventually dull - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeaker, a particularly ermüdender film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people get bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a &quot;vulnerability&quot; scale for a long while. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale are statements such as &quot;Many things I need to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, Stephen Vodanovich, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are quite a guyed bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents contacted seven to eight times a day with a pager. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and in doing the homework, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3 percent of parents surveyed feel to bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He is sure, however, that &quot;the young people perceived to be very boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: Are you healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not because, in the extreme case, it meant that people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many writers and philosophers study the relationship between creativity and boredom. This view is Professor Vodanovich researched the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom is the brain a saying that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain do not always know exactly what you do best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can have feelings of happiness in the short term, this flux but again in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> A bored child is an iPad is enough, it can stop this from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself, or to control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;self-control is transferred from one situation to another.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to entertain, but also gets more self-control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Even if we do not see too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant activity and technology also casting home. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the relentless nagging desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people of truth is looking for a way to unwind and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, find it hard to deal once the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for a crime to justice, will soon be legal in this state, the possession of a few chunk marijuana and a pipe that he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said that he and some friends were in a car with it in third when they were stopped on the road near the border with Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, are excusable peccadilloes, each equipped with a penalty of $100, and received a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; said Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer in hundreds of drug-related crimes less by the law than from the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of the offences which will turn to marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures, has been dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities have adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws take effect in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in the more conservative districts of Colorado prosecutors have promised to follow up on existing marijuana offences and are still quoting people in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time voting in several cities, from the Denvers suburbs to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. 2002, chief of police in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington scratch at the head at a loss. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, it believes that, in any case, Colorado is ahead of most states regarding the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for private domestic consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore suitable for guidance,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Insurance for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent that we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on December 6 and is also the end point is a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practical issues have to be resolved at this time - about how the government target of a &quot;reasonable access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops should be agreed within 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;nowhere, it will be difficult to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, &quot;a recently formed group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November sent an e-mail, chief market its employees in Aurora, in which he said the prosecutor would no longer pursue people over 21 years in minor marijuana offenses, and that the police will seek &quot;immediately&quot; show no penalty for this offense. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief market added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and traffickers continue to be pursued. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he was at his office would continue to monitor cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many have been prosecuted for other crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our agency has an obligation to pursue violations, in which it was the sentencing issue was crime,&quot; Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the reactions are ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand junction, the largest city of the district, is no longer in the possession of small quantities for adults. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also decided to drop proceedings have not all outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions across the state encouraged a profound dilemma in view of the large green experiment among local officials. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> District prosecutors are a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant in court for marijuana offences and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for the legalisation that they still cannot accept,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first states to deal with small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national sample of cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials prepare for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give in. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several spectacular more arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser of the Obama Administration believes that investigators probably will happen no doors to confiscate small amounts of drugs, but may be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, government-regulated marijuana shops. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several towns in Colorado are just not waiting for the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although they could open only in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be passed next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to get into a position where we license someone at the federal level, and then have a huge problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this legislative amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We do not then and then for what the community has decided to what the government has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petro nella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not only university students of today are attacked for their views </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It was always my biggest dream was to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once considered for the main temple of knowledge of the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s - there, I had intended to study history - I had my bags packed and brought about the first scandal of my life again. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke out in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In the Evening Standard said, I would be gone, because I had a problem with it, that other students had sex in the adjacent room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author of A N Wilson said rogue, &quot;I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because I was quite unusual name, or because I come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> We had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this right now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from a similar pursuit. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The rising and organized hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection benefits the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College indicate they will personally attacked because of their political views, &quot;often active in isolation and declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They call for a place in their college equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The situation was exacerbated by a recently-tra aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, bright and on the Right,&quot; was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It was shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and occupied with silver suit and silver Gehstock protzte. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> At other universities, conservative students say they are viewed as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: &quot;There is a growing trend in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without having met us at all. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is &quot;embarrassing.&quot; the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says that it has observed a growing hostility toward students at JCR members of the moderate right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first week in Oxford, I was part of such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I was a very shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university voted to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the first semester-week, in which new students get to know yourself and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but even pleased took part. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues such as a cut, the rejection of the government and the privatization of sanctions against South Africa&apos;s apartheid regime found its way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> I was in my first event French texts translated into English from the 18th century on what should come next, I had not been caught. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I stumbled there. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?,&quot; he asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students kicherten. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Wallten tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time - in other words, if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities,&quot; soup like Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Back in my room, I returned with hängendem head. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> On this evening, I sat alone in college at dinner, when I typed someone lightly on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was the second year of a German student named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is as it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected to be Tory is harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your dad is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most Tory first semester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub, I later tried to distract me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all counts. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove to be unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: &apos;You&apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was dirty and perverse. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;As Tories sex?&quot; asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> To beat each other, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals had to have felt before the liberal legislation of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I like-minded people can meet only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years before me were extended to my inner eye to a purgatory of isolation and ostracism. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, was the only tutor, which was open to recognize as a Tory, which had its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Not only was he hated for it to be a conservative, but also because he had written speeches for them and advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place, found him narrow and parochial and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he adopted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will be not happy here,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge on more sensitive friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the taken all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Such a thing would never do not in my city of dreaming spires. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends was always impeccable manners on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Marred his moist eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Give the whole thing a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure you only neckt thee. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart if you gingst. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakening. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and relinquished his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> In the following week, another history tutor during a Tutoriums seriously had claimed that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I secretly in shame zerging, my parents gave me that I had undergone a &quot;brainwashing&quot; and called it &quot;old idiot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me a wine fan tail slack. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-old should ever suffer under such intimidation and mischievous nature in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university, which not only produced 14 Tory, but still hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The most difficult job in the world: The human work animals from Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros are the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry on the steep, rocky trails 70 kilos of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is hell, and others are literally working in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living by retrieving sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He must rise every day down on the floor of the crater, where the burned gas from the earth solidifies sulfuric gas in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds in total, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the final stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of age meters, but the weary carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, where they have to put their steps carefully and keep the balance so that they do not slip and crash. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that each step can cost her life, as she was a French tourist who years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The mine from Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur that reduce them. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> On top of the hill, force them to run and shoot the way between the tourists like circus monkeys with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to balance a mining company has established a little further down to a height of 1850 meters </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi (never rather) exploiting its workers and that the deposits in the volcano since 1960, which they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur pays. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> They then sold for every 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and is used for the manufacture of string wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we usually carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way,&quot; explains us Anto that usually makes three flights a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He needed three hours for each course that he is completely done, he has at the end of the day but then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What looks like a lousy pay for such a seemingly inhuman effort is three times that of what he would earn working in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The daily wage of mine here, where the coffee harvest will be paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167), very high,&quot; said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village in the area, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia, &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java, to convert them to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27-year-old Anto puts his life on the line on Kawah Ijen for three years, has already left the first traces of sulfur in it, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will be working here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in a more than decent English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This friendly and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of carrying Els. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and is on every morning at two o&apos;clock at night because the sulphur tube where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish shines. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp in his helmet, which he bought with his own money, in the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 carrier load on the baskets with sulphur crater floor on their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its huge profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized to save costs, and provides those who work on their own account and paid for by weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> They also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) bid a camera, the guardians of this nature demand money at a rate of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), along with the admission of the tourists who come for the shooting of the volcano and the human-el. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is not for the people and for the animals&apos; protests Madrusin, a preparatory, 42-year-old carrier, which operates three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that to continue, &quot;as long as there is&quot; because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the thick columns can become trapped in the mine, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses, of course, in addition to the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> With the basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years confined in a position to carry a 50 kg. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano on a goat path between the Bushes of three trucks to be transported to the camp in Taman Ari 18 kilometers away. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life,&quot; said Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur-carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> As time passes, but keeps the mediocrity generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: Those who work as human last el on Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The SWF blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the upbringing of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore has to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, You&apos;re my patriotic wife: We meet our civic duty and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but still, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The rates are part of a rapper-songs, who is pushing local slogans such as &quot;a&quot; Bao &quot;(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising firm BBH, which has shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to perform their &quot;national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the internet, so we had to make it funny and witty. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The breed is the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue we had to take action on. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirts with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings (fast). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Be that many of these ideas were creative, it led to success but not mandatory. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought: Why do we not be as creative as possible in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The Government of Singapore is he that this issue is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> Couples and parents for a package of government grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has so far had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city state in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> In accordance with its national population authority the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why does the SWF not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Spouses and family policy for Tan Wei Ming, director of the national population Authority, says that it was the result of a &quot;better training&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single parents and the delay of marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims at a drastic increase in the immigration to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> There are Web sites in Singapore, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese be criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year reached its worst election since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate of the known effects on economic growth of a nation that has the health costs, tax revenues, and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments will be built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> They also have an impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as &quot;shoe boxes&quot; and may be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company selling El Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; is much more quickly than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units. </seg>

<seg id="2659"> I reported me to express myself and write interesting tweets on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if someone answers, invite-only,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;The social networks are entertaining, I can easily talk with friends or relatives in the distance,&quot; he gives in. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger asked. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Even if someone a stranger empfähle, he would ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of the 14-year Jose is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ask to ask it to 20 of the people are not knowing that he has attached to a friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;That frightens me not because we have anything in common, it is music,&quot; for example. </seg>

<seg id="2668"> &quot;If somebody harassed me or they asked of me,&quot; he is simply remove it from my account. </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this is cyber-bullying,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with university degrees in education and learning, says that it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform, to guide the children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was established as a medium for the search for information, with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game but,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of the book &quot;digital natives and immigrants&quot; shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we learn even more,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that this is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria about what can be said or spread, published, and that in an age where the maturity of this is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, they will bring food for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;to tell you they should not do it doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras calls after some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, like the one that you&apos;ve released from a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know, what others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> If you have photos of celebration labelled the other people asked for permission before? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: Should all know what you do at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone is outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professors, primary school teachers and educational consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the directives of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If you understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example the age, or what can be published or shared,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the Guardia, children need to be reminded of the &quot;Thou shalt not speak with strangers&quot; lesson. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today without publication of the Declaration of Lima in Peru, which was previously announced, and should, in theory, be signed by the seven present rulers. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe tried repeatedly to gain access to the document signed at the sixth annual meeting of the leaders of the Unasur. Sources in the state and presidential office told initially that they would pass the exam after it said later, however, that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> For questions to the text gave them that the content was outlined by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information about the summit meeting was limited at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day was limited to the press room but the image of the president meeting with the message &quot;private meeting without sound audio.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few details that had among the journalists were received by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The list was the only document, which was distributed during the day, the participating presidents, what caused unease in the hundreds of journalists from national and international media, calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> The presidency of Peru then sent to the media an e-mail with the &quot;declaration&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala was rather than the official document at the end of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was host of the Third Summit of South America, Arab states (ASPA), and on this occasion was published by the press the so-called statement of Lima, which it had previously announced, neither despite emphatic call. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, one can convince themselves that the document was released last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> The Peruvian authorities on both international meeting stressed that the information systems would be available for the journalists, but to a large extent they limited access to the information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Peru&apos;s president, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima launched against Santiago, listen to the pleas of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will follow the verdict on the differences, which we are currently present this international court, and run,&quot; said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and remains a country adheres to the international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submit to the international courts,&quot; adds Piñera gave Humala with hands and added pressure in front of the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ, came after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it held for a serious mistake had filed suit against the agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to subject themselves to the judgments of this international court. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, were present at the summit of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, which is excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the ousting of its president Fernando Lugo, participated in the meeting not. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The head of state is leaving the final document, in which it said that 16 decisions taken and the plot lines have been set for 31 projects between the South American countries on a total investment of $17 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;will take significant steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that action would be pursued, &quot;to improve cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and transnational organized crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America as well as in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe must &quot;accept the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is designed to expand our production capacity and our people to a better future,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the spatial links in South America, particularly in rural and border areas... and, therefore, our countries to unite and develop new forms of the economy,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a statement read out. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects were also five Peruvian who are on the horizontal axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which will make for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> It also took the final document about the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption of the Union of South American Nations serves,&quot; from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart in Mexico on Saturday by Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua, to treat the maritime dispute after a respectful of the ruling of the ICJ Bogotá in question. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Probably I will take on Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday) with the president,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also make the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua is necessary,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope the president Ortega can say that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; Santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto,. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit also met in the run-up to the defense minister of the block the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened in relation to the defense of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members at the UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has time on the chairmanship of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans &quot;during World War II and in other clashes killing&quot; and &quot;today are practically a fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which drive the Unasur&apos;s member states. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The president of Ecuador advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The teach never commit to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and financed by the United States,&quot; he said in reference to the political asylum, in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights&quot; would be met. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that there have been &quot;justified suspicions at the time that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedures were not followed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticized the Swedish judiciary have demanded of him, put him on its territory during an interrogation subject for an alleged sexual offence, &quot;the Swedish law that would have allowed beyond the Embassy of Ecuador in London via a video conference can be executed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that would affect the health and mental condition of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Ever since he is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious,&quot; said the head of state of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It was, however, the risk that he might take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises carried out in the open. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That would affect the health of every human being,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for the month of June, the granting of a free briefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Europe&apos;s Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities to find a solution for the captive founder of WikiLeaks, he stressed that there have been talks with London. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, we do not address this word for this case, there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, highest Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain morning granted the licence, has done so in my opinion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And, if Mr Assange in Sweden, the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype interrogated, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate &quot;the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie to deny freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are bad, not the evil and corrupt politicians, journalists who are seeking profits and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists &quot;and neither of the bankers or spit and hegemonic bourgeois countries,&quot; and took a re-election in advance that he &quot;will deepen the revolution to continue to move in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also backed the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body should be &quot;must be firm and held no opportunism and not legally faired coup,&quot; because &quot;the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and in the wake of the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua before told to negotiate with Nicaragua in the maritime border between the two countries, for &quot;absolutely right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At present, this verdict is not implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between South and Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that you can overcome them and look to the future. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> As he confided to a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that &quot;it is right in Latin America, call the international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he was a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to reach his third mandate in a row, he indicated that he sees this possibility &quot;with a lot of joy and optimism, although it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that he would retire from political life, to lose the elections in February 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but in this unjust circumstances as in Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the faith that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must live up to that responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I should win, it would be my last term as president, and then draw me back from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is firm,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa was also related to the treatment of health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had visited for a routine, planned treatment, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable advance, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The cause of the deaths due to AIDS is now a belated recognition </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when it confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb struck,&quot; he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried to &quot;without apparent success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in front of his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to concern itself about his illness and started to find out about it, and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the time, it avoided even the director to adopt a clinic of the IMSS, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Although there are still many people in the hospital who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused harm and has exhausted their immune system and are the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, &quot;means the great success today that the survival of a patient who receives the treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that the information had been supported by a reputable scientific publication in April of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> An expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 final results were that AIDS was a death sentence, but that years of survival and the quality of life by the extent of the damage the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that those people would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis is HIV-positive, in that sense, &quot;can easily be 75 years old, so long as he is under control,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to keep this progress right, it must be remembered that today, on average, the life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in the past few years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS to the annual report of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (yes)) reduced, it is nevertheless true that have died since the release of 60 percent of the AIDS patients covered in the national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, it is already 187 deaths in Jalisco alone, however, will be assured that there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why is still dying people in it? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drug. The problem is that people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, that is in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a compelling statement: &quot;Nine out of 10 patients come to us if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, so all persons, where this is necessary, need to be offered screening tests on a massive scale.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal voting experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also for patients like Fabrizio, who made his test carried out at a private laboratory, and that the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even the Kaposi&apos;s had Kaposi&apos;s Sarcoma (one cancer tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we would like to hear nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I have to die, then burst like three times,&quot; says one in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was good to improvement, I ernähre me do exercises and take the medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> His parents now know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like everybody else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I have to take a lot to have an active and responsible unforgettable pastime, I respect the other person and my health,&quot; Fabrizio agreed to share their intimate details with Jalisco MILENIO counts, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS Day fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They should make the test if they belong to the Risk Group. The sooner they should know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they can learn how to live like all people in a responsible manner. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are large gaps between the ordinary citizen and health programs, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In certain places, &quot;actually increases the distribution of condoms, before they were made individually, now they give us to packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> New infections for high-risk people include the young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What do you have?&quot; is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, guidance staff in schools, assured employees in pharmacies and health care, do not want to expose young people, the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only located behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoting promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question, whether condoms should be distributed under his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;sexuality is not enough; it is the best way to bring the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data from Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 1.317 HIV and AIDS). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> Be 92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, blood and 2% 6% over the perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are four or five people for every registered case that do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> After the appeal court confirmed a ruling of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the group&apos;s liabilities vitro, which was reached on a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, creates a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country, the payment has problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> You could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies that have no validity in the land of the Stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements, the Mexican laws allow. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the appreciation of the ruling by the judge handed down on June 15 Harlin Hale at Bancarrotas court for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the decision of the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico opens the door to call the Supreme Court of the United States because of inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> While the judge in the case, indicating that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, says the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, firstly that the bankruptcy in trade with Mexico is the main proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that companies with countries from insolvency proceedings cross profile in the international cooperation is not known. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Indeed, to this end, the model law created the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, and the American Law Institute was used as an arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Second is the judgment that without the votes after the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the companies that had the vitro branches with its parent company, would not have achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, that possibility will be recognized by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Indeed, vitro not is the first case in which this scheme was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de the Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade Kon courses). </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also that after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro complained, in other words, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent anticipated. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This is not taken into account by the court. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand there is vitro to blame for its difficult situation in the context of serious economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country hits from 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For this reason, the family Gonzalez Sada before the same court odds to make the vote in plenary vote, in other words by all the judges, because only three of them. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> Which is not granted, the Cerciorare-under appeal, which calls for a review of the case by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The Schwerwiegende about this case is that the court had set aside a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the in vitro procedure is described in the framework of the law on trade Kon courses, which points out that it had kept strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries, in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> It will also pointed out that the country has been subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, the established rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between creditors and debtors. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> The basket was the way to the basket ball, Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes, sports combined for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country&apos;s passers like Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, lower class, the first National League player was 6 years Rexes part of this sport, be it as a player, manager and agent in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;My whole life I have set many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the national team BSN, CEO and president of the Association in the 1990s,&quot; remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his loyal wife Isabel, for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes exaggerates not with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and they testify. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Those are the most emotional memories of his time as a player at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or general manager of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;That was my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as general manager, trainer or Mitgeschäftsführer eight championships. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many rewarding years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then on, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good manager, &quot;says Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that I was Gene Bartow, who has worked as a trainer and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a very strong and 2 m players. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Want him? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse inhabitant left and was one of our best launchers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember how he had said that if a championship for Bayamon Mincy possible, Gausse would lead to another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, as he stood at the top of the Association in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he plans to enjoy his executions and Mincy&apos;s in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won against the United States for the first time at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team that you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan Games in Cuba, where the US team offered a fight as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup against us and we won gold. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> When the team were playing not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also the young players &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón (Javier) and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote&quot; Morales, who could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and who gave us great joy, those of vorolympischen tournament in 1995 was varies, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> At the level of international tournaments, his numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at that level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that is without taking into account the different leagues in his career, in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The boys like the work of Leo Arill well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you believe is the best thing that you have achieved in the dressing? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the team&apos;s most successful era from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What will you have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For the guys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national play offs meet teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, referees and officials-table. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> Now what do you play? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, watch videos from YouTube in music of my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side. </seg>

<seg id="2939"> J.R. had threatened to portray them as prostitutes and impregnating them, if they are not left the city, but also had other reasons to want to see him dead. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman interpreted Ewing&apos;s role as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: A devious businessman and untreuer husband, sought to have its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) soak iron. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what should be on the tombstone of the culture,&quot; said Hagman 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should read &quot;Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only business that he has not won. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin on Friday on the original series, recalled Hagman as a &quot;tremendous personality on and off the screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable for millions suitor in the world and leaves us who have had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts. </seg>

<seg id="2960"> The start of the course, who studied the &quot;end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2961"> The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Each semester, when religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of &quot;long count backwards&quot; in the Mayan calendar on December 21, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the next two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as &quot;Deudarmaggedon&quot;, as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste Semester that has ever occurred,&quot; said Charmé this week the students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If someone analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor of this semester, which ought to be the last in history, &quot;offers courses on the&quot; end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In the course of Temple gives beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker &quot;media, culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why these ideas spread over time,&quot; he said, as well as the way in which offered hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear materials could come into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month analyzed the students studied films with apokalyptischem content and how they compare in comparison with real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform students about what is likely to be credible, possible and impossible,&quot; says Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology beisitzende formed a team to offer a course with the simple title &quot;The End of the World&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We are not in 2012, so that we can always retain the option to re-organize the course, in the event that the world does not go under,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the imminent downfall must study the students create projects and attend graduation exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> The final examination is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse in Penn State, which is why the students have no other option than to &quot;continue to work through the night, which claims the world comes to an end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were very popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;In two hours, there were no more seats,&quot; said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students asked if there are seats available. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, religion and sociology from age 64 for a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> The 25-year-old student nursing and psychology for Will Wekesa said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed,&quot; he gave in. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed, rather than just a professor, said, to believe in the final date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society, which brings back several centuries, as people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has increased this speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;elsewhere people do not think so,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> This is essentially the case in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches this year in the Philippines, responding quickly to the question of whether he would have &quot;a course on the&quot; end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world,&quot; he wrote as a hint to an exception of a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall pointed out that many days from the last court has been discussed over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;the people immediately think of a new date,&quot; or about philosophy, that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year period, that would be the end of the world. </seg>
