<seg id="1"> The strategy of Republican Party against Obama ’ s reelection </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justify their policies necessary to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Brennan&apos;s centre, however, such a hoax calls for a myth that voter fraud is in the US is less common than the number of people who die after the lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Republican lawyers for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada in the US have responsibility for the organisation of federal elections individual states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in this spirit of most American governments from 2009 a new laws, which make it difficult to process or writing to the electoral list. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon was expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, it was only for the year 2011 for 180 of the law restricting the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require voters to present identification with a photo ID and proof of the American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Such laws also limit the period for elections in advance, zneplatňují right subscribe to the list of voters on election day and withdraw the electoral law citizens registration in criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections in 2006, did not require the submission of the electorate půkazu card with photographs no American state. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The first state that this requirement, the Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The constitutionality of indianského confirmed in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities hurried to the extension of the procedure, as well as other countries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> For the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states in order to coerce voters to submit their identity cards with pictures. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as a health card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, stepmother 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with photographs issued a government authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also does not have an identity card about five million new voters in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The purchase of the identity card, moreover, is often more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect mostly young, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> 25% of African, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000; 18% of people aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years and therefore does not have the required identity card with photographs. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are known as the electorate with its shift to democratic candidates are not in a number of Member States shall be authorised to use his identity card with photographs issued their school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting or fishing clubs who opt for more Republican candidates, the cards issued these clubs in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004 did not require no state election proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The first such a request introduced Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011 by a dozen state laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are obviously going to restrict the number of votes from Hispanic minority. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Instead, the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Those restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the general election in 2004 underpinned a campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Measures taken following 2009 but has caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Republican lawmakers in five other states have laws aimed to shorten the period for elections in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, even though the African American voters in this country was only 13%. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In Hispanic it as well. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the other side of the white men who were 76% of all voters, they were only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Against the laws that restrict the registration of voters, is, of course, very strongly built a democratic legislators and their supporters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Democratic Governors blocked his veto a couple of bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Part of the damage they have managed to limit. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, the law requiring the identity card with photographs by only 16 of 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The newly introduced rules, however, quite difficult in 2012 the exercise of the voting rights. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics speak about bias approved laws, an apparent attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Report: Brennan&apos;s centres of 2011 shows that the States, where were these laws approved, represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary for victory in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say for sure that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: Today, these new provisions will have an adverse effect on turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of prostate cancer: Undergo examinations or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> PSA test brought sometimes erroneous results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical emergencies. </seg>
<seg id="55"> All this has increased the reluctance of men who have been so reluctant to the examination of all go. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To investigate or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked for the view of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies performed in the US showed high levels of contamination between the test groups, it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> A further study, this time European, said different mortality among patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go to them. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed a after 12letém detachment that those who do not follow the examination, have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend examination of 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Are insecure group are also men with African origin. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take the right decision, when cancer is revealed. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and such species, which are inert. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is therefore necessary to patient level of the type of cancer, to offer him the alternatives, no cure necessarily prostate cancer, which is not in the long term impact on life, and focus in these cases rather on the active supervision of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, a number of men who had been diagnosed with cancer, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive, and threatens to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They propose rather implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression offering the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, and with greater precision establishing criteria, which help in deciding which type of treatment and which not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Yet, I therefore recommend screening. </seg>
<seg id="70"> It is important but go to an interview with the doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo testing or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created movement Movember tool that allows you to assess for and against in the context of PSA testing. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Disease prevention </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the advances in research seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of the principles of a healthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if all the healthy eating and sufficiently moved, it could be avoided by up to 30% of cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If all stop smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%,&quot; underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian company for cancer research. </seg>
<seg id="78"> By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Some percentage of also remain unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even if the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> They are also risk factor for a few more. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is extremely harmful to human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers,&quot; shakes his head spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker will quit, decreasing the risk of cancer deaths by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Stoutness and obesity are according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus and pancreas and womb. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research indicates that the regular physical activity throughout the life they protect against cancers of the colon,&quot; says the report. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommended limit consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It is appropriate to avoid and sausages, of which the same is true. </seg>
<seg id="94"> To preserve meat by salting, drying or may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can cause damage to cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; says the report. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent times, the various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, research has revealed clear conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="99"> The study focused on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Although one of them will be to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk more about his increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Even the effects of vitamin D in the cancer is not clearly established. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their fears and the precedent of the family doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson examined </seg>
<seg id="105"> Notification of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosonu caused a stir last summer. </seg>
<seg id="106"> There is a view that this bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the matter in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And also, for the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model - our best or at least &quot;bad&quot; explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - which, however, has not been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Between the physics, though, there is not yet a 100 percent certainty, that the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Nor is there doubt that we have at our disposal entirely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as foretold the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The new data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto it rather confirm missing, however, have all the information, so that we can have absolute certainty. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose, however, that this is a Higgs boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what was happening. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world is quite definite law, according to which the two things cannot be present at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This rule cannot be ignored - and not to try too hard, lest you hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although the particle physics very strange world, it turns out that she is a similar law: The Pauli exclusion principle according to which they two particles occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - the &quot;condition&quot; roughly speaking creates some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Further divided physicists particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently follow Pauli principles. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And at the other end of the range bosony, wretched anarchists who do not deserve nothing at all - not of this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosony is further divided into two groups according to equipment (by the way perfectly wonderful), which is The Particle Adventure, laboratories, Berkeley: Mesony, here we go, and &quot;force particles,&quot; which is a natural force, and with whom the Higgs boson probably related in some way. </seg>
<seg id="119"> However, it should be said that these bosony are not so exotic animals, as it would be to believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If this article you read, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot;, which is &quot;a&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when particles with an electric charge accelerate or change its direction, &quot;write&quot; the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;intrusion&quot; is the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc) and this wave of is nothing more than the photon - and thus one of the bosonů, &quot;of power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> Nor is it with the Higgs bosonem, except that, &quot;disturb&quot; should be another field, the Higgs field, to be the boson. </seg>
<seg id="125"> This the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like in the frozen surface of the pond, which moves just a lot of a large boulder. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For this reason, it should be used as a part of the accelerator as accelerator in the laboratory CERN - Large Hadron Collider is friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again to clarify the relationship between Higgsem and substance. </seg>
<seg id="128"> With the electromagnetic field do not respond or all particles or all of the materials. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, so do, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be alone to keep in the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And so, with the Higgs field are not responding all particles: Those that do, have a certain matter, while others (such as the photon, look at him) do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> And Mrs. Nováková asks why all these studies are &quot;bring us?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="132"> From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and forecasts SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Many physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space &quot;new physics&quot; and to close some of the loopholes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It is to be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, there is no clarification of gravity (whoa!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of the space matter (whoa!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> Device CERN until now, however, such contradictions. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Responses </seg>
<seg id="137"> These responses research in the everyday life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Look: At the beginning of the 1960s not pioneers laser at Bell Labs has no idea of the revolution, for their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They assumed the scientific use, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in 1960 invented, and that created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered a &quot;toy in the lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine that.... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, may be the result of all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during its operations to the optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The scanner, even if that Boyle at first as planned, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; of all digital cameras in the world and brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activity around the LHC will necessarily must change your life, but it means that you can never really know.... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - Best way to leave the life... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> By the Commission for the dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in an awkward questions about the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should soon followed, and at the same time is about the bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> In this crucial area remains to be done plenty of work. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Only a few weeks ago, Mr L. still alone in my apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a reprieve. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;Give me five years of life, and it was seven,&quot; says no emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, arriving on the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is still shock, that you can prepare,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease had done their work: A vast makes it impossible for him to go alone to the bathroom or eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees that will help him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> It is a brave and even and smiles, speaks with the unknown, who was with him stop, brings him his medication, offer a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage to a death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My dearest wish is to get rid of diarrhoea, this is me,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, a team of doctors on his problem lék. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;Throughout the life of one learns that the men urinate standing up,&quot; tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the installation Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Return to the stage for some people in an intolerable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Depends on the ability of a man,&quot; whether the return to take, says psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> In the view of many people who deal with palliative care, with crucial moments are taking place at the heart of this. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> The forecast is for up to three months to live. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage of their team of doctors and nurses, who cared for them, so to speak, &quot;therapeutic&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> In the case of Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst concern to die on the &quot;suffocation in full consciousness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> The disease but allow me to their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a good kids,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;In my life I have no wish,&quot; he says, and then do, we breather. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Yet even to meet you in the days of the last visit son of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides care of the body with the help of nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So it looks palliative care, which is, if not to do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="175"> That death was more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec is a bed palliative care at 11 700 residents. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is a very few, if we consider that all gonna die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martelová, one of the medics in the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it is the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> When you die, you can give him, for example, sip brandy or Pepsi, according to taste. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics already does not have to watch the level of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death there is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night carrying beer Mr X, who later died in the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning beer finishes his son in honor of the late father. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are helping patients as well as their relatives,&quot; tells Nathalie Savard, director of the care services. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but like each other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Beside třiadevadesátiletého man, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while his připíjejí in his honor, die tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children after tried all options to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For a year, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years,&quot; tells fearfully Dr. Christian Martelová. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients in the home of Victor-Gadbois come, come from their homes, 47% of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problems with access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, once the sick to reach the final phase of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, they specialise more or less exclusively on the care provided to cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care fears that the adoption of the Law on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by the leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which the show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christian Martelové is not a Quebec healthcare system is sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on alert in enormous pain without anyone done the necessary steps to relieved. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Afraid to ask patients about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists takes care of its patients until the last moments without regard to the negative outlook. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hope for survival Hélène Richardové have already been minimal, if left competitive chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my onkoložce that concludes with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us. </seg>
<seg id="201"> And they told me that it is over! </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who want to die, thanks to the treating physicians for their wishes recovery, when a team of palliative pussy ease the pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it is necessary to say that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereauové, director for palliative care in the Society for domestic palliative care the Grand Montréal, patients from the treatment of pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by fits and starts, or whether he administered a sedative. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see eye to eye. </seg>
<seg id="208"> The patient, which escape the pain will have greater access to paliativním sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients, which is not given a sedative, always the same: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you to give me the euthanasia&quot;, this means, rather, &quot;I want you to get rid of me pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this story to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in health care. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Administration officials, businessmen in construction and public works, the lobbyists of political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell, what do they know about a &quot;system&quot;, in which the mingled construction, public officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> This &quot;field&quot; came Quebec taxpayers very expensive in particular between 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is interesting how the system crumbled, since we have adopted fundamental measures,&quot; says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Thanks to him burst into 2011 scandal, on the basis of the consistency of the investigation centred on the embezzlement of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec that the liberal a Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Duchesneauova report confirmed&quot; direct links between industry, opaque funding for parties and corruption of civil servants. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,&quot; he says, &quot;saved only by the Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars,&quot; when some people to check their instincts to get to share! </seg>
<seg id="219"> Charbonneauova Commission &quot;has already led to the resignation of two mayors,&quot; he adds, with the hope that she can &quot;to uncover the cunning of some of the people.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="317"> It shows how is 1 League amazing. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win. </seg>
<seg id="319"> It seems as if the PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče. </seg>
<seg id="320"> It is good that says that there is a &quot;dependence on Zlatanovi.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful, and that gives a lot of goals. </seg>

<seg id="349"> Thanks to Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified the transactions and the costs of processing among the beneficiaries. </seg>
<seg id="351"> How is in the framework of these technologies often true, there are obvious political outlook: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), as a virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...) and the hypertext transfer protocol, similar to the BitTorrent protocol that allows exchange files between couples partners. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered cca 200 000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Course bitcoinu first reached highs of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later dropped to $2, today it is on the border of about $10 (summary of courses is listed on the page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Compared with the world in exchange for real money or financial products that nothing is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="357"> And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) of this fact interested in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Bitcoin describes as &quot;the most successful virtual money&quot;, &quot;competing the dollar and the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the standard money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin, from other types of virtual money that is as &quot;credits&quot; used for the procedure in the video game, a game or which could buy (and sometimes even back to replace). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Each month, but the central authority of the controls and treats individual communication. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In the case of Bitcoinu are all nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How this network work? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses using e-mailu. </seg>
<seg id="365"> The user can choose another address for each payment, which provides anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> File information associated with this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Network so can verify the legitimacy of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Key phase consists in the writing of this new transactions in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Selected by means of resolving mathematical task specified computers, whose grant, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is the phase cut file; i.e. the transformation of a file on shorter and unique digital print. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The &quot;take&quot; this new transaction and add to her number, then a whole &quot;chopped&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number, which provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number, the other nodes easily checked his accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user wanted for fraudulent pay twice the same money very fast (within 10 minutes), the only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to prevent inflation, dividing the two regularly, probably by the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited the number of 21 million, can, however, is split up in part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation. </seg>

<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of pedagogical books on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia is equivalent to the credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on a cell phone, but uses a system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions that are due to cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Moreover, the Nobel manages his identity and may remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to set in the traders, where it is not required to install the new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Suffice to say the address, which can be phone &quot;ofotografovat and identify&quot;, specifying Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement to the questioning of hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before the Bitcoin, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive,&quot; predicts. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US, workers are on strike fastfoodů and supermarkets </seg>
<seg id="723"> Work on the counter facilities &quot;McDonald&quot; pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days, in America, a wave of protests against the low wages in the company of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy &apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether she is destined to be soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The share is supported by trade unions and many leftist social organisations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Apart from the increase in the modest salaries, the receiving line workers in of Walmart and in the systems of fast food, is the organisers of the protest to achieve in them to create in their trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Currently it is this economic sector virtually untouched union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, a million inhabitants, and in some cases was accompanied by and brawls. </seg>
<seg id="731"> In this day of some workers, Walmart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the unions and leftist activists multinationals supermarket chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle class. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries and vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores are in an average of 8% and 27% cheaper than in the big supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, many employees with low wages in shops Walmart buys only in work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Availability and the range of goods made chain Walmart is one of the largest companies in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> In the words of the critics can afford to Walmart to sell goods so cheaply partly because few paid their employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or small scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The demonstrators on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies rose sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Typical worker Walmart receives 9,5 dollars an hour, but that does not match the height of expenditure, say the staff. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage of $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion per year. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is in an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If the company Walmart moves to increase wages fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit to the state only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, so customers will spend about $12,39 more than today. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Advocates of Walmart pointed out that protest took place in nine countries and companies should not cause almost no damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; in the stores of lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursdays until midnight the following day, and during that time, the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Treasury in &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview for retirees aimed website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart, and that the protest was a &quot;other media sensation&quot;, organised by the unions. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Neobsazená treasury!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not commercial houses Walmart (those in the progressive city are not too fond of, and therefore almost here are not), but &quot;McDonald&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald says that sells billion portions, and then you be paid sick leave and is not properly you for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> In this expensive town has no lower wages. </seg>
<seg id="755"> Well, how can you in New York exist for that kind of money. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Employment in &quot;McDonald&quot; can get away with almost a quarter of American teenagers who are working behind the counter after school part time and live with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Currently, I kept in an interview with workers &quot;McDonald,&quot; who complain that live on the money, and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum on the Wall Street Journal hangs comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you know how it is you feed. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protesters, which began at 6: 30 a.m. Thursday in &quot;McDonald on the&quot; were Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks in fast food began to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wages. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Also demanded that in the realm of fast food were based trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the creation of trade unions and activists to punish the trade union movement victimisation and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> From the other side of the management of them rarely makes life easier. </seg>
<seg id="764"> Deploy in fast food trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main reasons it is extremely high turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Disagreement </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day, held a noisy protests also in many other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of that action was in the noon rally in &quot;McDonald&quot; near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&quot; says that sells billion portions, and then you be paid sick leave and is not properly you for your honest work! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators to support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity it deserves every New Yorker!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Whether the event will be the spark that lit the flame of mass movement, is still unclear. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;So far, doing brain to deceive the average&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Among fans of modern technology virtual reality is a popular topic augmented reality; in the last time, it means in particular view the world through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> In the early years, at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of the news, and in November, it was announced that the application of the relevant patent has also submitted a Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim suggest that, for scientists are spectacles of the past. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Láká je prospect tampering with virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - tell us, in general terms, what deals with your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with the interactions of a man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Mankind has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes on the screen. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipating significant changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, console Xbox and Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensor Kinect, because for all of it is very interesting to the proceedings with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What is still ahead of us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite that, the Kinect shifted interaction on physical level, very much interaction is still on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The flow of information with improved (system accepts greater amounts of data), but output flow yet not especially. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change it, we are working on a 3D imaging systems based on different technologies including projektivních. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to allow the computer world into our physical world, to make him real. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this purpose, however, it is necessary to identify not only users, but also the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better shape. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place, to hell with the stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> What do you think of vocal control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is a popular thing, but not be remeasured? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - Sure, it cannot be considered as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform the other in our vicinity of its activities and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with the computers are good, but in their own environment. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, devices control in public places we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not for long, just about such Granny, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Gestures, while nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet, which followed the movements of the bone and muscle. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Yet it is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In general, however, that the future of the Joint Control Type, for example, gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - And it how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - How me, for example, asked me to give you this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You tell it, and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> I usually just talking. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, it will be very difficult to identify. </seg>
<seg id="804"> So you want to get users to adapt to what in the moment can or cannot machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - This is not necessary, but it is an approximation. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can detect more reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It can, for example, be laser scanners, which provide a relatively good depth of distinction, this is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - if you have-to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements of modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Today is not sufficient detail, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In fact, the current generations - this is what we can be reflected in our work in three dimensions. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, that it would be good to 8 megapixels at 1000 f / SC </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not just the megapixels, but as a matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Looking at the matter are all current technology for lack of us - it seems the work of designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So we must remember not only distinction in axes X and Y, but also From. </seg>
<seg id="815"> So very important is speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is a dynamic and the current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass produced scanners are closer to the other value (60-100 ms). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of humans with the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For me in the work was very useful equivalent of such equipment, only need so much touching, but I need some frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - In the Kinect system are now used three &quot;camera&quot;, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera - that is, in fact, a scanner visible zone. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> The greater number of cameras could potentially to solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary performed calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how this will help in determining 3D position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presenting publicly their glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that as regards the daily use of technology augmented reality through special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> -of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest variant would be &quot;portable&quot; form of reality, where it would be possible, on the basis of the platform arrivals / departures areas whenever switch from his glasses on the smartphone, the display screen, and around and around. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Glasses - this is a very personal equipment, this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also weakness - on the basis of augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also to a common man. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which critics often point: There is a response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feels nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In their classes often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh successive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that complement the tactile could well be the eighth breakthrough. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So far, is one of the more interesting tricks - the use of his hand as a kind of background for viewing. </seg>
<seg id="838"> An excellent way records compression! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really focused on the addition of these appearance of solidity &quot;images in the air&quot; - such as the interference of the direction of the ultrasound beam in the defined point where finger, raises the tactile sense, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on the pads of his fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects nerve endings in his fingers - also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To think that feel what it seems that he should feel at the moment, when you see? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, that we have tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge, which will fight long - how to make the humans, who are physically located in a very restricted area, to believe that he was walking in the open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (no such as in clubs), a moving platform and also huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> If the deception of the brain becomes goal, so the work is still in many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things is in the very early. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is a continuation of the project &quot;Petrohradska avantgarda&quot;, dedicated to citizens, who are in the lead, they are avantgardou culture and the arts. </seg>
<seg id="849"> At the top of the list have been notable art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching všeruského eminence. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero &quot;Rosbaltu&quot; is amazing designer Ernest Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller - the bearded man, who is dressed all in red, which you see here in the Russian Museum, in the Summer garden, here in the taverns and vernisážích. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Ernest Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Ernest Miller - this is a striking man St. Petersburg Touch of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Besides, that is a city man, his appearance on the streets is the smile on the face of the citizens, is increasing all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently picked up the organ and became a Saint Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with my uphold the bohemian life, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Clive, why do you around town in a red and yellow or, for example, in a turquoise? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - &apos;I have chosen red as a designer in due and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is a red colour compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public. </seg>
<seg id="860"> While it is generally accepted that everything is a little different from the grey, aggression and brings bad properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are geared to was bound conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - A when you understand that you have to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - The Exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood what is my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then she went to a wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists I could not understand. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I made friends with artists new wave, with post-gazoněvskými who brought us to &quot;Puškinské 10&quot;, and other wool were not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It attracts me to the theatre, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it all had mutated in your art-clinic... - For me it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should gather all the forces of creativity. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took place on 10 Puškinské, and there before the renovation was musically-art club, arty club, home petěrburkské Bohemians. </seg>
<seg id="871"> There was much: Nome, Tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura brought with the project &quot;Ear Van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Šnur and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed in full-length leotards, midway between them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band began to play live, &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg led many programmes hali-galivských times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them the Trachtěnberga, started his career, basic education and training from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; club &quot;Griboedov - this is the aftermath of Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> This way they left our workers and permanent guests. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000 he was structured survey in the press, the special price was &quot;People in our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist,&quot; I was appointed as I, that ended in my top. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times under the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your works are characterised by an identifiable way. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, in which it is vividly captured timeliness and penetration. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I have a programmatic exhibition &quot;of the Russian Museum in klaunech.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless categories. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before, I used to be sociable, today it is painful and terrible. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in klaunech everything collapses, scanning the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in having order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today people meet under clothes, focusing on external drive, not a single man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Or perhaps he could not take his hand and it is necessary to spit in his face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And illusion will be removed to change. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Recently we have seen you in the role of urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> And who should be, if not me? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - A may be commercial art fair? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - At present should be commercial, utility art thorough, tactful, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> There is the failure of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people used in clumps, bohéma loved one, the other people. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, all broke on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very hard to all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a 100 bill, I liked all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> It is necessary to think who likes. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - A on Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - The him come fans, there is sexually social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on the cultural land come 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything shrivel. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, is that no one is fooled and, what is ingrained. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I was painting such images that one collector hung on the wall, along with Falkem and Larionovem. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the images, which people generally ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, people often confuse concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: Culture, the culture of the consumer. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumer, it is from somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused to money for drawing images. </seg>
<seg id="914"> And I for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Clive, what is in Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Dobrých experts on culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a concept: Functionary through culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Not all of them, but he can deal with the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> For the proper tsars that it was not at all, tsars may not understand culture, but understand that it is necessary to support the real experts. </seg>

<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but differ by honestly say that not all modern art, we are artists who should look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> What is it you think Petěrburk? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petěrburk - this is not the main city of culture, in Moscow is culture much more, there is the right land. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our fallow, the art of doing poorly. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural land, but it is our writers today more than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe is very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, it is a layer of only weak. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to art has become a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>

<seg id="934"> Global warming or the collision with a killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of ships with Earthlings on board shall be issued on the road, looking for alternative planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, this raises the question: How to keep his rod in terms of fall or to the spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the selection is not great. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two of the planet, which it is possible to learn, even if only hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is Venus and Mars,&quot; says a senior scientist for the National Astronomical Institute p.. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> While they are but on Mars better conditions for life, on the surface of Venus are reaching temperatures of up to 500 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Live there is possible only in high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> To address the issues of reproduction in space, scientists began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> For half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas produced in orbit are no different from our Earthly kin. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was then made the judgment of insects in orbit - very small the fruit fly Drosophila. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 was sent into space for the quail eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in microgravity. </seg>
<seg id="947"> On output, we are absolutely normal bird. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, to stand on its own feet and begin to move,&quot; says the head of the Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> If they support, the chaotic fall and do somersaults. </seg>
<seg id="951"> After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds to complete the demise of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The birds did not respond to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the trouble was that, in four days just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected, because there is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; says the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;miniarcha&quot; with animals flew into orbit before 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> In biosatelitu Bion &quot;but&quot; will be the only beings of one sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The experiment with rats, who were already broadcasts into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In fact, there had been nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was only on biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such experiments is to be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir Syčev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing on the ground by rats was born offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, but failed. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals at the loss of the usual environment simply cannot pursue its sex instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Man, unlike the animals, in principle can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking, and is able to create an emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons, similar experiments not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest danger Tereshkova ’ s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Nejdrahocennější thing mankind has, it is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last years in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether he could for a flight to give birth to a child. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Why, on this question, no one answered,&quot; says veteran ’ s space-sector Vakhtang Vačnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, was born the son of the other woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who worked in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The risk, however, remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only a few cosmonauts, which after years of birth and grow healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;In addition, it can be dangerous, even in the orbital years,&quot; says an astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia Valeri Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Humanity still must inevitably seek new roads in the area of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a mandatory stage training to fly. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in conditions with zero gravity, astronauts embrace habits needed to work in an open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Though for adults is water, while comfortable, but in a way a strange environment for small children is a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between the fact that the child is situated in an average of 9 months in the amniotic water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing expire only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is a very little to the forgotten something,&quot; says swimming instructor newborns Marina Aksenovová. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if it is for newborn baby weightlessness more natural condition, then for women is natural, inevitable gravity, magnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting disease of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the basin, the body ’ s ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> We can leave aside, if they work promoters of muscle in childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the organism mother dismisses the foetus. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And what then?&quot; Asks Valeri Polyakov difficult questions. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If not for the organism gravity, fails to form a skeleton or a set of muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn baby in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult in a suit to the burden, in which he could train. </seg>
<seg id="997"> They will be deprived of what developments urgently needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;If you go to the experiment, which shall accept the birth of a child in an alien environment, bring on Earth, a disabled person who would be completely inappropriate to our environment,&quot; predicts the Commission for Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So having children in the universe is now just a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Once, however, the time would come when the reality and when Earthlings issue in their ships on a distant planet, which has become the home of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The OWLs: Control švarcsystému failed because of politicians </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement good controllers and the quality of legislation, but fails in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but must be correct application - this is what we believe is missing,&quot; comments on the current situation Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Similar conclusions also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of an incorrect practice provides access Petr Nečas led to &quot;švarcsystému.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister, said that the ODS will not entrepreneurs to bother his controls - so it is forbidden or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be somehow set, and if something disables, and even the Prime Minister can prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations,&quot; says Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German aside, within which was compared legislation on public procurement in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> About what was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel, which we took off about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Put simply, European legislation is governed by the way in which the public procurement contracts to address, followed by the different national legislations and then also the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We are all this together, and even when the control is not yet completed, we have a very interesting differences - generally speaking legislation is perhaps even more stringent and &quot;improved&quot;, but the practice is in some parameters better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to take care of itself, the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What you actually this project can help, what of him for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a common control might help to stop previous efforts to refining laws, reducing and improving margins, if it does not have such a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means to obtain appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always), the lowest price in order to avoid any enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But, by reducing the limit of contracts, it does not need to be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Maybe that saturate the system of &quot;paper&quot; that those who in the system they want to find the hole, so does it will be much easier than if the limit was higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak of domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is the office of a similar to our OWL, or it is configured differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What the authorities concerned, such as OWLs Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organised like us, also has a division, is a slightly different way, but in essence, both authorities are following. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the following the courts and at the level of individual Länder - in the system from our little different. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can be controlled only federal money, we posed by state resources. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are with us managed by county, the municipalities, the control of the level of federal auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the legislation, so that it is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would that without specific data like comparing, however, in some ways, is Germany cited as a model, but I cannot say that it is, in all the better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is therefore necessary to that have better controllers? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Probably not, but again, I have no such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, faced with a series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, it was no benefit to cooperate with our authority, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards the domestic legislation, what of your office meant the amendment to the law on public procurement, there are somehow its impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Whereas the validity of this novel is a relatively short, so we still in control events is not a man. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Because we are of ex post controls, is the need to deal with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We observe that so far only in the process of preparing the future of controls - we started our new tool &quot;risk detection inefficiencies,&quot; through which we run almost 14 grand public procurement, and we analyzed it - there are those changes are, of course, because the change limits, the conditions of certain types of selection procedure shall be adjusted, and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The approval of this bill therefore consider more as a benefit, or other load system bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that there may have been that she &quot;tighten rules&quot; and can not be adhered to. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are controlled person obliged the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes Regional Council) to each of the law on public procurement means a breach of the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> So, is the price of the law in this way;? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system shall exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will produce a greater pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how it out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us show the way. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister, said that the ODS entrepreneurs will not bother controls that alleged &quot;švarcsystému&quot; - and what does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Švarcsystém is forbidden or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be somehow set, and if something disables, and even the Prime Minister can prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> May said: &quot;We change the law and permit it,&quot; but I can say that we do, nothing like that. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the public procurement law are fairly strict rules, as what is to be formalised - which is right to protect the public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is out of the question for the formal deficiencies. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but must be correct application - this is what we believe is missing. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think about it, is less than a month to be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Together with the band The Tap Tap that we are doing more fun and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world or delay prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, your totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> You can take it to readers to imagine? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a national fund raiser, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential end mayského calendars advertised on 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning. </seg>

<seg id="1118"> In addition, that we want to amass a positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public think about the state of the world once we bequeath to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the calendar mayského we also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original shots against the end of the world whose buying on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Group The Tap Tap, together with the other performers also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called &quot;The End of the World cancelled.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1131"> For an accessible training centre, which Studeo sixth year, with civil society in the Tap Jedlička&apos;s Institute for the Handicapped. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> For students Jedličkova constitution regularly are running out of instructors and deal with them in the activities that is fun and interest. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students do not have the means to the teachers themselves, they are not, therefore, allow this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the framework of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building into which the project through. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert vystoupí několik musical groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what you pick? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to set up a program that appeals to all age groups, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>

<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group of disabled people. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> As these paths manage logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it first appears. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the luggage area, also, of course, feel a large quantity of cargo and boxes with tools... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, so far, it always performed without problems, CSA and British Airways on us were well prepared, how many times I had to. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, that was no problem. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to výjezdům abroad, you can compare the different in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have not yet met? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places, where everything works better than us, we just in Russia have seen that in the east is still in full. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to the Prague is Moscow very barrier, there is still an unusual that a man in an electric wheelchair himself stood in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There is no such obvious as a wheelchair users should give priority in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are civic associations that seek to problems for people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what, on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There is a lot of things, in which we are still behind.... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation is always depend on the efforts of people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is perfectly normal, that is, people with severe disabilities separately on the public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very normal, that there is a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in the social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only up to the moment of us will be important athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, so things start to change really. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let us go back a few years back what you in 1998 to decide to set up her? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I got as tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I have many young people who were interested in something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I musician, I play, among other things, on saxophone, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time it, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that help us, when we began to link with singers and also to work actively to promote bands. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Us that work, which is not visible, in fact, as would not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was your intention to go with The Tap Tap that high? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do something else. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Showbusiness is crowded with where one is another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is a logical, all new shall be taken with caution, and it takes a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Things that are isolated, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, is, of course, regret, it is natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not suffering all the abandoned beings, which we must regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that when we get back to people with disabilities, so it is not the only for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Help this success, that you are a stern boss, how many people you saying? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do a good job, we must be in many cases uncompromising and require a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people are coming to us with a romantic idea, and with his head in the clouds, and if he finds that has twice a week to go on trial in medicine and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leaves. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> This is how it works everywhere, in each group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open group, people come and go, this is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and the taste is always the door open </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be held the day before the expected by the end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, led recently Plynojemu for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week it was at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA has become 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path of Poland into space has already begun much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Years into space was devoted to the Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which 6 December 1933 was thoughts of his pioneering work Access to space. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Thoughts of a young engineer (b. 1905) had an audience with cold, and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said about his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld in 1934 gained Access to space in France price Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Vzpomenutý Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a big advocate of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became the world ’ s famous purveyor of aerospace and his contribution was awarded and the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925 was built in Poland, the railway trolley, which should be fitted with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and unknown or details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether it should be used for driving away the mantrip or to its application. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933 to rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Research to make Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From surviving materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage prakzických tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, the arrival of the German troops research was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the specialist press discovered a photoelectric fighter missiles, designed by the engineer Rohoziński and in the following year out of work - Rakieta torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects are intended for military use rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all military use of rocket technology gave Temp Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all work coordinating. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two of its activity ended the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another work devoted to space after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, there is mention of society in the November issue of 1954 magazine Problemy, in which they are four more comprehensive articles on the subject of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society, which will take up space. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> In that time, he projects in artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is promising field. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> From the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia on entry to the International astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Deputy International astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This function until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956 to PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which carried out the research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type of RM-1 has been completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a ceiling of 1800 meters was about 80 cm and a weight of less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later she was built an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 started in Bledovské desert flight tests of two instances rockets RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was long 1.4 metres and its weight was about 11,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another development type had been able to real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have the ceiling to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring the height of the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, in 1962 was further developments paused. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Descended first rocket type RM has become a rocket meteor-1 developed from 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two tier, its overall length was 510 cm and a weight was 32,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> They were developed three types (marked the meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different sizes for the scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The meteor-1A was available space of 0,4 litres, meteor-1B of 0,34 litre and the meteor-1C of 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Service ceiling: With all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 probíhal v Leteckém Institute development rockets meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Rocket meteor-2 was a mass of 380 kg and was able to bring the payload on the weight of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently, built version of 2H and Tut-Tut-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is worth mentioning the entry of Poland to COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a National Committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland is also in the framework of the Interkosmos involved in research space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after Vladimir Remek second interkosmonautem. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the constitutional court of law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution would live in public debate. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economic services, national economic systems are in permanent conflict between them. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and free movement of an unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The influence of the considerable differences labour costs, (wages) there is a price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> This concept is to be understood condition, where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods stand in the competition, &quot;will&quot; price competitor to wear a greater share of the market and thereby to increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheap, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where prices are working in comparison with other economies high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital has no social responsibility, and that the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising necessarily social state spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The whole situation is compounded by the reluctance of business to pay taxes, and the replacement of the economic and social corporate damage in the pursuit of profit has done. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that there is no need to be specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Reckless practices of private equity in the individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to enter the competition with a view to artificially reduce social level of their own populations in order to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments give private capital to their own population regardless of social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> It is, above all, in the amendments to the applicable laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is economically forced their own population the diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment, partly by limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty, together with an increase in the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are already many years of public ticket food for the poor, who are unable to feed their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people is already in a million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is common to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Council. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Austerity measures, virtually all of the southern states of the EU was undoubtedly lead to the same condition, where the people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social level forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or left to languish on starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might someday private equity capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here is to be but inquire where but coming? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it from other EU countries, then moves from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still working for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> It concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and media ad nauseam claims that the state can capital to participate in its own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private equity stubbornly takes the view that the state must not control interventions to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then there is a need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now governed by policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> There is a clear answer yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Proof of the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all Member States of the lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation, in the area of corruption, providing the mutual advantages, the law, where it is virtually all reprehensible, but nothing criminal. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds are entered the drafting of the laws of the private legal firms, which are often in connection with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the power that comes from the people how to preach to the Constitution of the Western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that a liberal oriented democracy is now entering the situation as it describes Appiános in his work “The Crisis of the Roman Republic for the days of Caesar and Pompeia:&quot; State was already long in full of decay and authorities obsazovaly violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> For bribes, unlawful obtaining favor and using stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people go to the polls with a sold voice... &quot;character&quot; of the people, so that they shall not apply, so once it was as a result of this disruption has become eight months without consuls &quot;...&quot; It is indeed to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda, and that it is necessary to choose the energetic man.. &quot;Appiános while he thought of Pompeia, but the Caesar, who changed to take democracy to tyranny. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> Conclusion As in antiquity as is the current company based on a reckless preference for own benefit regardless of major interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private equity is not inherently able to understand and apply to major. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is now, as then, unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform more profound. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Kauzalitu onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore find in indiscriminate liberalisation economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of affairs, can be the demise of these systems in favour of democracy liberal type as a break with the expectation of further rounds. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites ignores in future be fined casualties, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have now seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal of the law on public works is not an option, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both on the international and the European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms, which will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, will strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Lab chaos. </seg>

<seg id="1302"> We have to admit that we live in a time when it is the world ’ s wealth be tested should be concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Between these astronomically wealthy families out one, which could be considered as head of octopus (if someone standing over them, I do not know, but I do not rule out that) - Rothschieldové. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Much about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop connecting their names with a criminal acts, in whose background stood and which for them has always been to consolidate power, an increase in wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are the main shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank should not be conducted or prepared war (against Afghanistan that was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq that was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but in the meantime, Russia provides that the central bank of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone this family tried to resist, he died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central banks Rothschieldově Bank of America, he began during the civil war to issue its own (government) money, was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered in 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden was in 1936, poisoned after what he wanted to sue FED for launching a major economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars, the Freemason 33 degrees insiders Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was to remove a monarchist state authorities in Europe, the other was to remove the colonial estate in particular of Great Britain and the third has lead to a reduction of the world ’ s population at 0.5, 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume so much sources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is none other than the clearway available for such a solution) and a final takeover of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group ’ s richest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and lead to deterioration of the situation (see the FED, to avoid a crisis like the one in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So then, what they managed to the assassination of the heir to the throne of In-House R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, destroyed the czarist Russia running the Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (no longer needed to war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of Central European powers, Austria Empire. </seg>

<seg id="1339"> The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was compounded by the fiasco attempt to free the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Imprisonment of diplomats were finally released for 444 days, after negotiations mediated through the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate at home of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history, which America has brought a small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the conquest of her fled six employees. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After the complex business ended up in the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get it from Iran, helped the extravagant cover story - drove to the Canadian passports as members of staff, who in the country surveyed the location for the SCI-fi epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which was invented by an expert on &quot;exfiltraci&quot; Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> That a legend was credible, on film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation for a long time were classified, the film is based on memories Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, realistically, the political thriller, also called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story during a piece, podrazu - example may be a series of Danny teammates. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film, so turn the mood - on the one hand dokumentárně broad sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photos of events and the way they were the same situation presented in the film - the large differences in that they are not). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, pojednané with irony and slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Then there was the scene of CIA headquarters and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the table, in the corridors of the Office, in the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleckovi to restart a remarkable career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From the mockery actor has become a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of cynical comment. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film, after dark Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller Město (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first Affleck film, which was discovered in the director&apos;s is home to Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> CIT for the atmosphere of the place was between characteristics, which director older films place above Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck him in Argos, where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film are taking place in the streets, when rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also will emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when somewhere suddenly move history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues are in the scenes fabricated (fake staff in Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many events in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that told the story does not offer much in the film the meaning of exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> Quite successfully with the works, sometimes to the realities of something přimyslí - it was all so elegantly leaves (a scene in which the impending crisis in the Tehran airport averts call in America and chase down the runway is pretty farfetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is but restlessness arising from the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in reels Hollywood collaborators very charming, their characters, but have more space and are not in that movie far from the only. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Affleck film a bit lost a dramatic move, this is a slide that it is possible to monitor with mild interest, to appreciate the implementation and retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But it hard. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a sort of living history and proof of how exaggerated are ideas about the almighty and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice. </seg>

<seg id="1384"> The interests of the lobby, and for that, for example, that bananas the highest quality in the Union must be at least 14 cm in length and they have &quot;anomalous curvature.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1397"> &quot;We handicapováni that we do not have the sea. </seg>

<seg id="1413"> This is not about it, be a senator or a president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If it in our country worked without problems, so no nekandiduji. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> Already, but I cannot see the past twenty years of the country half-blood, as thieves run, people are increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I like it, so I try to come up with a solution to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was forty, and I am an independent man or not, I have no choice but to how things affect, than to run for a senator or a president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, but soon you will get you to the Castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> All the time I was saying that to fight on the go, according to result in the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My aim but is not a function, function is a tool, how can I realize his vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that as a nation at each other in a pub, and in front of the TV, but trampling everyone who wants to try to change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Add to this the media, which humans dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech, freedom of the lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me is to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> In the battle for the you started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the retroactive property returns over twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, but you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole may propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to resolve this conflict? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I was a citizen lobbied for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, to reject the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent man or not I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My priority is that without the partisan categorization and dogmas can I take what is best for our country, of each Party and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself more as a human right, or the leftist? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the English perspective, it seems to me that people are more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important, if a little to the left or right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important for us to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> This is not about whether someone is to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always I will support any public good, although he will propose Communists or ODS, and so I am against bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you that what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you byznysplán in the company, and you have an ideal target and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you are trying to close. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some might call populism, but all of the proposals, of which I speak, in the world of work, or talked about that. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament I would have just password. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics in the long term nevystačíte. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Persuading politicians, journalists, and the public, and try to get them on his hand to it through. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, the judge and the prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When will be strong personality, which will be naming abuses, can push on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president, it was doing public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I am not even a genius, not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For his views and vision of trying to find allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> In politics, I have only just begun, and for his program to try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Things are trying to push himself, if not, for six years, and I come back to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> No savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that in one person, so I walked around a series of famous people, whether it would also candidates for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work he refused. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> So at least I supported investigative journalist John Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I ran with it, that people are really unhappy, but I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who go, most of the elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People navolili Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Yet I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct election of mayors and generals. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you thinking of setting up their own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I even thought, because I have no time to check the net past any potential Party man, and for that I have no money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money, no to the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about property returns, what is this yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private property I guess about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague I land in about 25 million, the apartment for ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, which means Superb in a million, and then I have a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, Aston Martin, I therefore that it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who in the car, he was gallant to women and, at the same time, fought against the corrupt and faults. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Do you Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million and do not have the money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but his own money into too much to you. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> It is into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, testifies about my program is probably not interested. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I have no obligation to pay from his campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The costs of the campaign in me, will this cover, what will I receive senátorský salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But from him I nevyžil, for example, I could pay son English school, which is 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> I just wanted to make money, so no nekandiduji. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So you will go on doing business, you can live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> I thought you said that these activities utlumíte? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it is not related to the amount of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I partly out of their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the travel agent in the spring of my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like to be Samaritan, which will save the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I need also to make a living. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much did you like the businessman was used to take a month? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Two hundred to 400,000, which take on. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I were president, so my business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The whole conversation in the Saturday edition. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in his head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 Sides </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;The building is cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is once again to see something interesting,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, IT technician at the nearby firm, says: &quot;Of course, the house is nice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> I, however, I ask, what today we need library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody goes or, yes? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, holds a special record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To this silly situation, a few years ago, the decision to contribute to the general education and build seven good painted reinforced thumbnails of fictional bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the training offensives but was not a giddy. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city councillor knew that there was only one way to become masters statistics: We have to have a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas of the Port of architectural studio MVRDV, master madly courageous column graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, took issue with the usual calm and on the competitive behaviour in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the Commission still stunned looking around and shrugged, piling insolent Maas their gifts on him by size and its aktivisticky reasoned speech ended the words &quot;Dear urban community!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> So this is my proposal to Mountain books in Spijkenisse, called a Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, was the mountain for 30 million euros piled. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the revitalizačního projektu, which also include an underground parking lot, the supermarket, the postal service, and several adjacent residential and terraced home with a total of 50 flats. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November was Hora books will be honored the second place &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Maloměstská gray, which still could offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extraordinarily ugly Hall, whose white facade you expected dairy, it is thanks to the richer for a bit of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Above all, but it has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of their existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long journey to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: The rock and roll under the hatch on the cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Means of Massif mountain jezdí elevator, but the real space and the passion to discover on foot control of topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere in the public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all the books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally is the bookcases along the facade, and is in the middle of a dark space, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We are a classic spatial configuration built upside down and space for the reader we push from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the books is cleverly used: In the center of the offices, the library, the chess club, environmental center and switchboard house techniques. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Special satisfaction are black shelves of books that were once the lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the stairs. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Over an unknown building materials, shaking their heads and even devout architects and engineers. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work there with recycled materials,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the municipality Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in one fríském holding one day they found a waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots of a millimeter webs of synthetic material. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and effective. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles, one of the last two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into the voluminous waste. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library was fleece - for the first time in such quantities - pressed down on plates of a thickness of four inches. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The heat and pressure, the Commission on Human Rights (Landbouwplastic) colour in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit as a new car and a bit like sports shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps do you get to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey you in literary café rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and ficus trees in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly about the humidity of the air in the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Gifts for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;I suppose you believed it, but this house is despite many glass of a project, as regards the environment,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Vytápí and cooling the heat. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although Hora books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Broad glued wooden trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as the shading and a large part of the solar radiation. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room is a very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Can handle the rest fully automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, starting a skeptic of the IT industry, already a new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Also, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg describes as a &quot;long awaited soul&quot; Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Reason: Each of the people of the city was a few weeks ago, was not invited to the opening to a book from his personal fund. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Should thus first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with the library, which currently includes 70 000 pieces. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has proved its worth. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves are filled with. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a greater role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in deciding on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin balanced on a narrow edge of diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Germany early in the week, first signaled that they would vote against the proposal on Palestinians observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, however, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, however, would be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed vote when it comes to establishing a nofly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> That eventually kicked in NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For Germany is difficult to take in the major international issues a clear position? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, this is so. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which was, by the US, in the direction of German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is made more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are therefore between two lanes. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I mean, in his role as only here to stay, but they are on the road to &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> In foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What is the &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, and its relations with the relevant areas, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The economic interests of Germany are to some extent other than the economic interests of other powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle East, especially in countries around the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, they must be careful consideration to the public, but even the elite in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It certainly plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> I do but not attributed to too much importance, it is not entirely unilateral relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any event, it plays an important role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Harm relations with the US, Germany, when Germany in the case of both important decisions, such as abstained in the vote on the Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not think that it was so dramatic as a breakthrough in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany even recover some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It indicates that must be considered as an international player, and his interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different views on the initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The US, in contrast, clearly made for the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are between the US and many European nations differences? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> These differences existed in the wake of America ’ s internal policies. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But as a result of the political situation cannot this attitude, of course, from publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think that the diversity of opinion does not so much, as always. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not too excited Netanyahu ’ s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> For Germany is not difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and to position the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think this makes it to the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> For Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot, therefore, be part of a broader line and they must instead to push things forward from his own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is just doing with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> For Germany, of course, is not easy, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> It was always a touchy subject. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself as a major international player? He wants to take over at the main role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still used, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look, for instance, at the European crisis, as always, when Germany shall take greater role, arise protiněmecké mood. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is an old problem: We do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a more difficult position than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the US in European politics now is constantly falling, but the EU this vacuum currently certificate. Who else is there? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans would just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they did not like it, they feel uncomfortable and do it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c &apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, Institute, in which academics and experts on the politics of Europe and North America together study challenges the transatlantic community. </seg>

<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection&quot; brands in China: When are the Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a marker, Polo Ralph Lauren also. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> What is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> For this is the label, which is in China is officially registered, but with the original company has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> He enjoys his protection, however, so long as it is real nezažalují brand owners. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether the law. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;For foreigners is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week lands on my desk a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Padělatelům just a few letters, so that they can submit their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> From brands Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada have to register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> In this way they are legally copied and German companies, sports goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens folder with the Trademark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> 14 September 2010 had left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name, which parazituje and fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and infringements of intellectual property rights. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities, multistory trading houses, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pattlochovy cases are but another. From the credentials of their clients are going against Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office is officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, and an associated tag. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word focuses on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> This meant women who hunt rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;That is to the detriment of trade, it must be combated,&quot; calls on Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and court costs affected industries running into the millions, particularly in precious sample products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the Society for market research is CLSA China with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing fast. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Company questionable entries in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, and something that costs. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Proceedings can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected action, because vytýkaný name became after a long duration of &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> When he has the misfortune to plagiátorovi even pay for the damage to his brand in China, says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Known cases relate to and graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German producer pumps on the concrete mix Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> To this day, therefore, the Chinese may use emblem, which resembles a star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The company Geely to buy Volvo, originally used blue and white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Producer fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned a crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Authority Známkový CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of employees and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the last year, the supposedly &quot;of the labour force returned from the emergency situation to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> For example, the number of unprocessed proceedings on the objections have decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Closed, 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Still, waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints on request. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To do something about it is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than the year 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It is a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind leads the list of new applications across the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This also applies to the number of all existing trade marks — is a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it was on fees selected 1.8 billion yuan. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Collectively, this means that each on average cost 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Start against this dispute is multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> This group for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have reached that was canceled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the forger clinched the Chinese rights to mark Freudenberg continue. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Alone we had, as in Germany cannot be surname protected, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Authority Známkový CTMO then also Munich firms has rejected. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the other two instances, Freudenberg obtain rights, but the respondent in dispute is fighting further still. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It is necessary to be awful watch </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the matter is dealt with in the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler has the confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it also says: &quot;The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us much time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company had to even look at a hundred years old files to submit any evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg the opposite in vain offered high &quot;currently the amount in euros&quot; in order to settle the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;So you see, what it means to us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> There is a risk that the danger from the Far East to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> And in this case, when there imitators will ensure unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> One Chinese producer, for example in Germany wanted to apply for the Freudenberg for footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This area of business group up long ago, yet he managed to avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;To be so careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> He and lawyer Pattloch advises German businesses that were in trade with China is very careful. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international známková rights. Strangers would rather have had &quot;everything in any way is for protection, even in China,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama of the mark, then he would have to the opposite to pay royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be in the contested segment pushed out of the market. </seg>

<seg id="2027"> The name of Anders Breivik, of racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still cite with distaste. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it is called the shooting &quot;event of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians are hard to believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> For the wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world ’ s biggest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 ’ s years of the twentieth century. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says in the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, with long blond hair and eyes of startling blue represents the epitome of beauties of the Norse prosperity. </seg>

<seg id="2033"> Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Nepředvádíme, we do not like flamboyance. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway loaded with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of most of the money from this sector invested into a special fund for future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial collapse, which threw money, the Norwegians had the laces on his purse tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;Until we can skiing in winter and summer going on trips, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; she adds with a careless laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> Standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - rakfisku have had enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Such an elk burger is certainly something else and is beautifully succulent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But the evening is stinking fish here. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> Hotel, where I live, is one of the many places where is rakfisk for dinner, and where guests choose the best, or rather to smell the most demanding fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> They have a link to a live television transmission, which is the moderator with bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem. </seg>

<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here is our scoring, Håvard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There was applause and laughter. </seg>

<seg id="2063"> For example, in the rural town of the Valle del Bravo to it in a good way. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> His citizens to the development of tourism in the resort and the building of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In town, you can now go for one of the new motorways, which left Pena Nieto to build. These motorways are a huge improvement from leaky and the rugged roads, which have been previously. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and an imposing interactive museum with the issue of climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect that will bring real and lasting change,&quot; says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, we hope in interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI out Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> MP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos, within the Party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> And refuses to express opposition characterising the new president, as a man of no substantive content. </seg>

<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen. </seg>

<seg id="2080"> At a time when he was governor, Pena Nieto was in the State of Mexico murdered more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - the place, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> In the best case, critics Pena Nieta say that during his tenure in office failed to adequately tackling the problem of the murders of women. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> And, in the worst case, his leadership accuse of escapism. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In the House, representative of the tumbledown neighborhood, me Irinea Buendía shows photos of his deceased daughter Islands Luna and crying. </seg>

<seg id="2090"> Government departments shall treat me as if I was the old gossip, and potížistka kňouralka. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want you to just accept what they say, and said nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it cannot be right, when it came to the many errors and omissions,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Sherpa, president of Pena Nieto Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico hit by violent crime and the new president, said that during his tenure in office will be his priority. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be the same president, as was the governor,&quot; he says in the Valle del Bravo MP PRI Olvera. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis mexicko-American identity </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many people have been forced to flee Mexico due to lack of options that are there. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame you, what had gone; they remind them of hard times, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely pushed his way through the crowd and I arrived for the agenda of immigrants, where I came upon the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: One for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;) and the other for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, and I did not know where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California and all my life I was called &quot;Mexican.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> That is ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston, called &quot;Irish&quot; and my friends in New York themselves referred to as &quot;Italy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> So I ended up in the &quot;Mexican American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I have no vocabulary of native speakers and I can get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for &quot;Extranjeros.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I was thinking about the moment this week, the newly elected President Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White House by President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were the usual business, which, when the leaders of the two countries will meet: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto also like to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create in North America trade bloc, similar to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, and when did not provide any details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico is the relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and its leader forced at gunpoint to overwrite half Mexican territory in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who is in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So minute after the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of the complaints about how Americans interference with the sovereignty of its neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children Montezumy steps on the warpath. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want to talk about hostile feelings? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Those is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers options, and others who do not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots lives in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which was in Mexico denied the opportunity and he had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more than it seemed, this person in profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of the poor village, etc., </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we are living the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> He sees us as a humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never sufficiently strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our existence is, in their view, only about failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we are now found no jailed for silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but still lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because the Mexicans more understanding of who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, he sees herself as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> And at the same time, many Mexican Americans, I feel like part of one. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You will get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in one. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico on us is viewed as the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And that relations even more complicated, want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I was in my trip, together with the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift &quot;ambassadors&quot; and represented Mexican interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should say our American citizens, how good is this country to visit, and push to the political leaders to solidify the relationship with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Well. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It is therefore happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many enemy feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain, that this is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I have a feeling that this is for you, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States, as it was with Mexico before one and a half century ago, so he must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feels uncomfortable in this way, with their family members in much closer to the past. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Maybe we have more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, a new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a basis for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> It can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such matter is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many of the buildings in the rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel ’ s capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But even when it seems that Israelis and Palestinians trapped in his ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Maybe this will mean that the fight will be even bloodier than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that it can suspend their deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war, which is neither won or lost. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems that, at present, there is little reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire concluded on 21 November lasted, the fight for this week to strengthen hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which in Gaza since 2007, will argue that the Israelis were forced to retreat, although Gaza has suffered defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the killing several leaders of Hamas and the closure of the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the poorest global and most populated corners of the planet, the Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas gains influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, they may very well consider Hamas leaders, that time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and the powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, revived regional power, which was once the Muslim ally Israel, was joined on the side of the Hamas. So Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic crescent around the Israel, to the north of Lebanon, where the party / militia Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu may unseat Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt in 30 years until its fall in 2011, not on Hamas time </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, Hamas may occur as a player, which cannot be excluded or Israel or America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms was Hamas deposited back into the box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel ’ s Iron Dome antimissile system could have their price and many missiles Hamas was destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israelis can sleep better - at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In the diplomatic terminology, America is as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the last round of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed about 30 Israelis, was in Israel a relatively easy from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that growing despite its illegality against international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party, at the beginning of the campaign in elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Lieberman, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why spoil the treacherous the Palestinians by giving them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If it really ruled in the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It would be better if we stick to the walls and is gonna, when his head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe hardliners won, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The Israeli defense spending are higher than the costs of all his four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The launch of the new war with local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign, and it may be the beginning of something new. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also the Israelis would be the situation should, in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians on a barrel of gunpowder, who must one day in the areas Israel occupied explode - as well as the bus, which last week exploded in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Already in the current period of repression in the Jewish State, democracy and the demography of this situation is exacerbated by the Arab population is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas will be increasingly withdraw diplomatic tax. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need incentives from the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is what they preached reasonable people on both sides, most of the outer world, and these newspapers: Two states, when Israel to the territory for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In the short term, there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide the pressures of the outside of at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stop the supply of arms into Gaza, has a better position than ever, to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs from outside also must push on the correspondence between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state has done more than immediate offer a virtual state sovereignty in the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In his first term flabby performances of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Now, back in the White House, it seems to be just as reluctant, in its entry into the process. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is shortsighted. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> America has a vital interest in a stable the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia have entered into force the laws of the bad cigarette packages </seg>
<seg id="2261"> On the shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warning for smokers and the sick part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Entry into force of the Australian laws on packages of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and paints brands replaced general olive green boxes of ugly images of diseased parts of the body and children and infants as the smoking of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are obliged to Saturday the only difference between the brand names, which are printed in the same small print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, that this habit of his attractiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> He relies on studies that show that if people start smoking until the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that start smoking never. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even in very small children, you can see that means the message that the tobacco companies to jointly with its product to sell,&quot; says the Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek, and cites studies that have shown, for example, that the children are in the crown logo with the idea for this to be a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> While Australia has one of the lowest levels of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies claimed that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper, more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This legislation will be to serious unintentional consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The forgers from China and Indonesia would be much more of these products, which will be sold on the Australian streets. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Another says that the laws have increased their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha from society Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family firms, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of the silicon used to cover the gory boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain &apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal on laws to Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that the company Zico has sold almost 6 000 pieces of wholesale distributors and expects the new supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> It is for us a good deal. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> As possible, experts say the popularity of social media in the demographic group, to which the plan aims. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sport events and demanding that most vendors hid the cigarettes from direct gaze, tobacco marketing moved on-line. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia banned internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you are marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this little scope to promote your products, is for you on-line space insurmountable place in which you want to be,&quot; says Becky Freeman, research workers in the field of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the evaluation of the marks on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out a &quot;John.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We have to ask, but it is a private citizen, who really loves Marlboro cigarettes, and he took the job and made this video, or in that it involved marketing company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how to handle the new regulations, than to marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far that paid Ukraine, Honduras, the Dominican Republic for striking new regulations - countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation, the claim that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that no country with Australia significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The ruling PPW is expected in the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Minister Plibersek, says that the government had held talks with other governments, which are considering similar laws relating to the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced mandatory warning photographs. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> A more stringent laws think Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Pictures of me to have no effect. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Just ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;I just take out a cigarette and a dip back,&quot; says Victor El Hage when buying boxes with photographs of the tumour in his mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, it is just one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, who own trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to a single packs is harder for him is to offset the shelving. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;The cargo it took me an hour, now it takes four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government is simply had to prohibit, then we say, okay, this is the end, close thing &apos;,&quot; he said, and spread his hands. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In the world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, as our plane mechanical difficulties, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Wait for a half day at the airport on the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But some scientists and experts in child development increasingly come with praise nudění. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that for us (and our children) is good, sometimes bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It has forced the brain to go into interesting guidelines, which can promote creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And whereas most of us today it is constantly connected to a screen, we have a chance to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should therefore encourage boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, as well as many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon occurred with the arrival of more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, which is the author of Boredom: And Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom has a long history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, originating in the first century AD. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then it is also a question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After seeing the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as experience &quot;I wanted to do something that would have satisfied me, but I was not capable of it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boring, from apathy by that person is involved in anything, but I would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He says that in apathy, there is no need to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> He says that at the heart of boredom is &quot;disruption in the spotlight, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowly of time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom may resemble a lot of depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, they bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while the people who are depressed, he sees a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are, then, if we only have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of attention,&quot; which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants in listening to the tape, on which a person read an article in the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others have heard so low that it barely noticed, while a third group heard him at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard a low, reported more bored than the other two groups - had difficulties in concentration, but they were not sure why these difficulties and the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or a lively task of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, &quot;as is the search for the bad parts of the factory line, distracting music can help with that, you get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, as we now know, twisting and drawing, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, may actually help with boredom to fight and to keep people physically more attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to shake, the more you learn and keep more information than those that are forced to sit on it,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all sometimes bored experienced - delay my flight, the loud speaker, especially the lengthy film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s have developed Failure &quot;for susceptibility to nudění (&quot; Boredom Proneness Scale). </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Scale includes issues such as: &quot;Many things I must do, is repeated and is monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests, that I have no time to do them all....&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Use these scales scientists discovered that boys tend to be bored more frequently than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular as regards the need to have more and various external stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Teenagers are generally indifferent. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were at school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that he knows that, &quot;adolescence is a time for boredom&quot;, which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people is not given much control of what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my original question: &quot;Is boring for you all right?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to have absurd natural risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain is always the best thing you should do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you were getting bored and using this energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you watch TV, will you please just for a moment, not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, bored, but will learn how to attach itself or separately drive, said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another,&quot; said the Professor. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learn just how to attach itself, but will give greater control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable, when we are out of reach of the activities and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We are accusing her of the need for bored with even more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> What people actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní,&quot; he said, &quot;it is hard to find ways to do when the sound off.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado is no manual on the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and footballer in southeastern Colorado, face criminal charges for something that will soon be in the state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and pipe, which was used to her smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one September day come with several friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After a policeman found marijuana in the car, it was Mr Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment to the use of drugs, petty crimes, which is fine for every $100 - and he was a date for the court. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They were to us as the criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But it is a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends response of hundreds of smaller drug cases in place rather than on the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of cases of possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington State, which has passed similar measures repealed. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police department stopped blame adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains votes to prevent the opening of new, state licensed shops with marijuana in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This matter is moving so fast that I do not know what will happen,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The head, gossip and regulators in Washington State. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - all within the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that the Colorado River, for good or bad, is ahead of most of the states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, and now a recreational. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado is more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of the State of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But as Mr. Smith admitted no place or system can do more than to suggest that might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, the I-502, shall take effect on 6 December, which also leaves the annual vacuum in which there will be a state licensing system, but legitimate possession of yes. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are complex mechanical issues that during this period shall be resolved, for example, how to balance the directive State on the &quot;appropriate approach&quot; to the licensed marijuana with his trade ban with hemp to 330 yards from the schools, parks, playground or child. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be more difficult to place licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, a research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> 21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that police &quot;with immediate effect&quot; stop blaming people for these crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws governing the medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado represents the District Attorney General Ken Buck tighter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office would continue in the prosecution of cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push on users, to seek treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even if many of them are facing another accusation. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal guilt, which was crimes at a time when they occurred,&quot; said Mr Buck in its statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response was a complicated and in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city district, adults now blame for possession of a small amount of. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The D.A., Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to totally all ongoing cases of possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think that I was losing my time continuation in law enforcement, until changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> For the district prosecutors that is &quot;the cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver, which represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the Speaker of the National Organisation for the Reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They spent so much of her life, people still cannot really accept that it is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states, which are to a small amount of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the national test cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Barristers and the authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the sale and the cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping the Ministry of Justice in. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite a few arrests of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it to attract attention, most of the federal government business with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 States in traffic. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> While protidrogoví agents may not break down the door to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state regulated shops with recreational marijuana authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drugs policy administration of President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several Colorado towns expects to federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election on some local governments approve moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he can any trade open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week the Montrose in the western part of the state has proposed the ban, and it is likely that the next week will enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in a situation where someone we license, and then we will have a federal matter,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are looking at it, what they voted for the municipality, compared to what passed the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There is a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I am a conservative.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> For their views are not only attacked today ’ s college students. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Remember that I ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> As my father and my older brother, studied at the university, which I think is the world ’ s largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And yet I am at the end of the 1980s within two weeks after starting at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and poured into the scandal of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke down and wept. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said, that I gave up because I objected to lovemaking students in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said, that I left, because I was forced to drink from the battered cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less comical. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of perceived enlightenment that was as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You can ask why this up until now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students to the right of center suffers from similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that the last week a group of these students demanding equal rights, equal protection to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the younger vintages (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of their political views are often actively &quot;isolated and personal attacks, and they made it clear that they are not welcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a position in a university committee for equal opportunities, to ensure that their views are free to communicate. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their helped the situation even more recently referred to documentary television BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (a Faery country: Young, intelligent, and right wing) on the student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> In the show, he was introduced to a graduate Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who drove Rolls-Roycem, was dressed in a silver suit and should stick with a silver head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> At other universities conservative students say that it is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as &quot;scapegoats.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> A Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told the Sunday newspaper that &quot;leftist influence in universities is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think that we as the Bullingdon Club, without at all with us. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> A twenty-one-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for more protection, says that the climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, while devatenáctiletá elected president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of the JCR to the people to the right of center worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During its first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred of the Conservative party was nejhorečnatější. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> A year earlier University voted to refuse to grant an honest former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> From the atmosphere, even Stalinists shaking with fear. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students met among themselves and with professors, I got to taste wormwood, which he had come. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that not only professors in the goading of conservative students, but to him. </seg>

<seg id="2441"> &quot;Ms. Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;fold please first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> It was me. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dortové dough, was much bilious. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?&quot; He asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students snickered. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you in their spare time took a basic lesson French, if you are not too busy social issues,&quot; said Professor Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Zdrcená I returned to his room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, this is so. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most conservative freshmen pretends that they are labouristi. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at a local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted on it, that I do not agree with everything Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick proved unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: &quot;You are the daughter of the fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are infected. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students with him notovali. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was sick, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;As the conservatives love?&quot; One asked. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> Hitting each other, right? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so as to feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could I ever lead in Oxford a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> I had to be converted into labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Three years before me, developed a purgatory ignoring and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only openly conservative Professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was in my school. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He hated not only for being conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Almost there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place for its parochialism and pettiness and for his attraction to marxisticko-deterministickému view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he got to the place of Professor at Bilkentské University in Turkish Ankara. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to commute from Oxford to house their parents in London, seeking refuge in their dispassionate metropolitan friends and family. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told Father that Oxford hate and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He could not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted all political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; said pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not have done this, not in the city of mood. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends had always perfect ways. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His dark eyes were troubled. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Try it again. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that this is a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart, if you left. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and surrendered his conviction. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week v průběhu výuky, when another history professor in absolute seriousness, said that I was &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Even when I was inside blushed with shame, I admitted to the fact that my parents &quot;brainwashed&quot; and called them &quot;old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief was just short. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Nail in the coffin of my Oxford career hammered my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> In that time, he wrote every week two columns in the newspaper ’ s essential walls. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I cowered inside and after five minutes of my pursuers. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they were gone, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me usmrkaným wimp. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18letá girl or boy should not be in education subject to such intimidation and sarcasm. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, of which not only came 14 Tory prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the undue reputation with equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest business in the world: Medium of sulphur in the Ijen volcano Kawah </seg>
<seg id="2557"> In four of the euro gamble porters in the Indonesian volcano with life and health, when they 70 pounds of sulphur down the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> People are, for which it is the work of hell, and there are those who work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make their living conquest of the sulphur content of Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Because of this, each day fárat up at the bottom of the crater, where escapes sulfur gases from inside the Earth, and in contact with air passes into a solid state. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After all the great blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them to his shoulders in the two bamboo baskets of the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> To the top of the volcano, which bars 2 386 feet, it is only 250 metres away, but exhausted bearers takes over 40 minutes before they get to the tortoise pace up, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected their steps, and McCaskey said&apos;d into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any misstep could become life, how it happened one French turistce that years before crashing down from the rocks Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which yields </seg>
<seg id="2565"> When they are at the top, making their way around the tourists, who is, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and hard to carry the weight that mining company placed a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in the volcano has benefited from the 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sold for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, was also intolerable, as this rock has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, firecrackers, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way,&quot; explains us Anto, which usually undergo three trips a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> One way it takes three hours and at the end of it is destroyed, but so can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> While this seems to be a negligible amount in such inhuman effort, it is three times what would be made in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Daily wage miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There was his pay 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a valid reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as the sulphur: &quot;I married with a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took it on Java, to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, it was hard to breathe, still coughing and eyes has irritated toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In his 27 years Anto three times a day, risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it began to take their toll, though his face protected by a special mask and glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Has asthma, it was hard to breathe, still coughing and eyes has irritated toxic gases that escape from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay for it to achieve his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work for two years, because I want to open trade or study Spanish or French,&quot; promises more than English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This charming and intelligent young man in a fate could be tourist guide, the waiter or the reception in a hotel, and instead of doing the work of the medium. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares the dirty wooden shack with other porters, and every day he rises at two in the morning, because the sulphur in the night continues to build up and its characteristic yellow colour change in blue and September through the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Despite the darkness Para Anto into the crater and illustrates the way a little lamp, which has mounted on his helmet and it myself, for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 media plots on the shoulders of the basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining because of cost savings nezmechanizovala, or provide porters working on his own and with this effort, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Nor do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the bonus for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the natural park wardens from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for cattle, and not for the people,&quot; argues, a burly Madrusin 42-year old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that will work, &quot;as long as possible&quot;, because he needs money to the education of their three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano was my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulphur burn his throat and eyes sting when the wind suddenly turn and trap the miners in the dense fumes from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them nestěžuje that suffer from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, into arthritis pain, his knees and cuts on his shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Unainik who balances his trash on his back, in his 53 years can load only 50 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his colleagues in vydolují volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three trucks conveying the steep path between the brush into the warehouse in Tamansari remote 18 miles. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I am not going to retire, die here, because the volcano was my whole life,&quot; declares Unainik and opens up the wide mouth, in which is missing a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty years old, also makes mining of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world is sustained from generation to generation - craft, who perform the human mules in Kawah Iljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singapurci waged that have no children, on the career, stress and the cost of living and education. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am married, and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Let us do their civic duty and zploďme new life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that, this slogan is part of the advertising of peppermint candy, but still — or perhaps because of it — the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of type &quot;give a bun in the oven as&quot; makes a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising agency but that video, hopes that they this advertising will be able to draw attention to the problem of humorous way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Artistic Director of the Agency Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of the music to people as &quot;my civic duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> &quot;It is entirely a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem with this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we have the feeling that this is a topic which we must touch. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government attempted to about a lot of things like to extend the perfumes with pheromones or organise familiarisation parties. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas could be creative, but not fully operational. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not do the most creative thing, as is the composition of rap, in order to solve this problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The one who is not too lightly, the Singapore government. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> A year spent 1 USD 300 to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars for a child, extended maternity leave and the allocation of financial benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> All these measures but had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in southeast Asia, also known conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 to womanhood. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Most recently, fertility rates 2, which is considered to be a degree of recovery, in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why Singapurci have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the National Bureau for the population, says that it is because of the &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a broader range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;People that are available to a wide range of options, with regard to the objectives and priorities, it is not only the marriage and family,&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> While in the immigration policy existed to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as the measures against the decrease in the number of inhabitants, between the local population that has caused resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> On some of the Singapore Web site is to see explicit xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and a little effort to integration. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year has seen government party Singapore its worst electoral outcome from the beginning of independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem by quotas and higher fees for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the decline in birth rates is unknown impact on national economic growth, tax revenue, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries to be not so many small home. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, began to have an effect on trade with real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as &quot;a shoe box&quot;, which can build in some urban areas. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments are area 46 square meters and had great success in marketability. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that these flats can encourage a bachelor lifestyle and deter developers to build a large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developers EL Developers, claims that their &quot;shoe box&quot; are far more quickly than larger houses. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> &quot;They are more popular, and so that is sold for days and weeks faster than houses with larger area. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Therefore, for our cash flow much better. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, admits that the new standards are the clearer rules developers who have previously been restrained, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one of the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed out </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although the new rules could be heading for an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the center of the city suggests that will have a major effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are still in the stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people have been postponed,&quot; says a young officer. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> &quot;The rest of you have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> But it is important to me to rely on his own time and money, &quot;said another, about a young man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women they cite the career, stress and the cost of living and education as those which prevents them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, whether the government is trying to citizens as forced to have children, they are all ultimately Singapurci, on the creation of a family who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is the private offline is private and online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Spanish Academy is something that has a personal nature or a &quot;area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is this privacy for a man of up to 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How applies this definition in their daily lives and on social networks? </seg>

<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and a graduate of the Education and class, it is considered that in children and adolescents in the social networks guiding correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> It states that: &quot;The Internet was created as a means for finding information, but when the social network, the rules of the game changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Education at Yale University and the author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, these concepts to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;The digital natives are children and young people, who were born in the time of this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> We are the digital immigrants who is we need to learn, and they only learn, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He explains that this is a complex issue, &quot;because we are asking them to, they could see that it is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, in an age when that are not yet ready.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> Also to be - as regards surroundings - reasonable, at a time when what most yearn to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, &quot;he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to this Specialist is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show what it is private, asking questions, which makes them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them to do, they did not work,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Further Marrielos Porrasová enumerates the some of the options: There are things you a stranger told, so why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or: Would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published kamarádovu? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other published? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When are you calling people on the photos of the celebrations, you asked for these people permission? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more: Need constantly all know, what are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;A man outside of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and the same it should be on social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Supervision </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at first instance and educational advisor explains that it is necessary to parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> &quot;If every understanding of guile, have a good basis to with the kids talked about the consequences that the account on the Internet can have. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> For example, with regard to age or what is allowed to share or publish, &quot;he says. </seg>

<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if in February 2013 elections loses, leaves from public life. </seg>

<seg id="2782"> Fabriziovi was 21 when he was confirmed by the results of the test: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if to hit me with lightning,&quot; tells the memory for a moment of truth, which the doctor tried to &quot;a bit&quot;, but without success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy that a family secret. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take his illness on their shoulders, and began to inform her... And it with such vigor that celebrated his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients Units HIV in Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (gonadotropin), which came in 1994 after a few battles with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio resides with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was inconceivable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and the greater the stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, with the director of the clinic of the Institute of Social Security (IMSS) saying, &quot;because he had cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then have AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and to live fully. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> It is, however, a lot of people who know about his illness and, when the virus has caused destruction of the organism and conflict in himself immune system, and then they become victims of random infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years since the world was AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, &quot;is a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, who in good time and in an appropriate manner starts with treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people,&quot; said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV in Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infektolog and a specialist in HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full of life depends on the level of disability immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, which are better for those who are not taking the drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells of up to 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV has been diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings &quot;in compliance with the treatment of live without problems of up to 75 years,&quot; said in an interview with the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To underline this progress, it is recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (almanac of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics 60 percent of patients. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, so far, 187. However, since 2005 is secured through universal access to antiretroviral therapy. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why continue to people on the consequences of the illness die? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - &quot;it seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> The way I see it, this is how it happens to us in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of the medical supplies. The problem is that patients are coming at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the condition of the disease, which in late stage of the disease. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Add compelling figure: &quot;Nine out of 10 patients, when it will be some Associated infection. All that needs to be done, we can affect the overall mortality, before the disease is diagnosed, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer testing for the disease to all persons who requests it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its draft coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do the tests in a private lab just because he did his friend, and despite its low age with him for the disease, AIDS and also suffered Kaposi s sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> &quot;Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they die, and they do not want to know anything else. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am to die, you three times a week vyřádím,&quot; they say, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was for the better, touching it, I practice, I take drugs. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today his parents knew only that he suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;I live a normal life as any. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I run active sex life, but responsibly, I give attention to himself and to the other person, &quot;enumerates the Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge, to share their experiences with the diary MILENIO Jalisco to today, on World AIDS Day encouraged his testament to those who are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> &quot;Whatever they do tests. If risk, so let him know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, this is a better... And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live as anyone else, as will be held accountable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This his message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Among the programmes for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest gaps are in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places, which is this task, &quot;actually increased handing out condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What do you want?&quot; Is the document in question is full of irony and assessment from the social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and medical staff that adolescents want to avoid, says reporter. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested this inefficient allocation of change. Whether condoms are not only for consoles, but a hundred whatever is in dávkovačích public toilet, in places where a young. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> &quot;It is not promoting promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Nor is not about the &quot;pay them beer and motel&quot;, as he reacted Governor Emilio Gonzalez to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Takovásexualita. It is best to make condoms to those who had sex life, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key figures in the state of Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 HIV cases). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> This means in Mexico fourth place in the new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in connection with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the diseases is sexual way, 6% of the blood the way y 2% perinatálně. </seg>

<seg id="2828"> The judgment of the court of appeal of the United States, which does not recognise debt restructuring company Grupo Vitro provided for the audition in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national firm with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the restructuring of companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements. </seg>

<seg id="2831"> However, the ruling opens the Mexican producers glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First of all it should be said that while the judge this causes claims that the creditors have to manage the Insolvency Act of the United States Court of Appeal Fifth district in New Orleans, says that the procedure, the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico. </seg>

<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed by the Federal bankruptcy Institute. </seg>

<seg id="2843"> Meanwhile, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal to the new assessment at the Court of Appeal that assessment to full participation, with the participation of the five judges, because originally voted only three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> If that fails, it will require a revision of the process of higher instances, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, that I had enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, joint owner, or coach. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we throw the team of the United States, which was quite similar, which blew a bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team had not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and &quot;Piculína&quot; (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote&quot; Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of injuries of the knee. </seg>
